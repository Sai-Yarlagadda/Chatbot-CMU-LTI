Mean Platelet Volume in Type 2 Diabetes: 
Correlation with Poor Glycaemic Control
Abstract
Background: Diabetes is a global pandemic. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is an 
indicator of increased platelet activity, which is considered to play a role in the 
development of vascular complications in diabetes. Platelet volume is strongly and 
independently related with glycaemic control in Type 2 diabetes (T2D). 
Aim: To study the MPV in patients with T2D, and its correlation with HbA1c, duration 
of T2D, and microvascular complications. 
 
Methodology: This was a cross-sectional, observational study conducted at the 
Department of Medicine, Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, India, during a period 
of 18 months on 300 patients with T2D. Blood glucose, HbA1c, MPV, fundoscopy, 
and 24-hour urine protein were done. Data were represented as mean+/-standard 
deviation and statistical analysis was done using SPSS software (IBM, Armonk, New 
York, USA). 
 
Results: The mean age of patients was 56.64±8.69 years, with 52% of the patients 
being females. Of these patients, 18.3% had HbA1c between 6.5–8.0%, 51.7% 
between 8.1–10.0% and the rest above 10.0%. A total of 51% of the patients had 
diabetes for 6–10 years of duration and 30% for more than 10 years. Patients with 
higher HbA1c level and prolonged duration of diabetes had higher MPV (p<0.001). 
Patients with advanced diabetic retinopathy changes and nephropathy also had 
higher MPV (p<0.05). 
 
Conclusion: Measurement of MPV in patients with T2D can be a useful and easily 
available prognostic marker, and hence assist clinicians to anticipate the occurrence 
of microvascular complications associated with the disease, especially in resource-
poor settings, and reduce the burden of cost for the patient.

INTRODUCTION 
Diabetes is emerging as an epidemic worldwide 
and is a global public health problem. The 
International Diabetes Federation (IDF) has 
predicted that 463 million individuals had 
diabetes in the year 2019, and this figure is 
projected to increase to 578 million by the year 
2030, and 700 million by the year 2045.1 Diabetes 
affects 77 million adults in India, making it the 
country with the second highest prevalence of 
the disease worldwide. Prevalence of diabetes 
is highest among adults between the ages of 
50–70 years old, compared with all other age 
categories. With an estimated 1 million fatalities 
a year attributed to diabetes and its associated 
complications, India was the country that had  
the greatest impact on the overall diabetes 
mortality rate.1 
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the most prevalent form 
of the disease, accounting for approximately 
90% of diabetes cases globally. Hyperglycaemia 
defines T2D, which is characterised by insulin 
resistance. Whenever a person has insulin 
resistance, the hormone is rendered ineffective, 
which, in due time, causes an increase in insulin 
production. Because the pancreatic β-cells are not 
able to keep up with the demand for insulin over 
time, an inadequate amount of insulin production 
might develop. Most people who develop T2D 
are adults in their later years; however, the 
disease is becoming more prevalent in children 
and younger adults as a result of rising rates of 
obesity, physical inactivity, and improper diet.2
Patients with diabetes have been found to 
have altered platelet morphology and function, 
and the mean platelet volume (MPV) has been 
found to be significantly higher in patients with 
diabetes compared with the normal population.3,4 
Individuals with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia and 
longer duration of diabetes are more prone to 
develop diabetic microvascular problems.5
Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of 
microvascular complications, and the increase 
in platelet size may be one component that 
contributes to this increased risk. As a result, 
MPV has the potential to serve as a valuable 
predictor of vascular problems in diabetes. It 
is believed that osmotic swelling as a result of 
hyperglycaemia is the cause of greater MPV in 
people with diabetes, despite the fact that the 
underlying mechanism responsible for this is not 
yet fully known.6 Alternately, a larger platelet size 
could indicate the existence of a high platelet 
turnover rate as well as younger platelets, which 
will reflect as higher MPV.7 The link between MPV 
and diabetes was clearest in those individuals 
who had the least control of their glucose levels.8 
As a result, the purpose of the current study was 
to investigate the impact of HbA1c on platelet 
activity as measured by MPV, as well as the 
correlation of MPV with glucose control, duration 
of diabetes, and microvascular complications. 
METHODOLOGY 
The present study was conducted as a cross-
sectional, observational study in the Department 
Key Points
1. Mean platelet volume (MPV) in Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an indicator of poor glycaemic control.  
MPV is available as a part of the complete blood count report and, therefore, can be used to help 
indicate the occurrence of diabetes-related complications, which is especially useful in resource-
limited settings. 
2. This cross-sectional, observational study evaluated MPV as an indicator of glycaemic control in 
patients with T2D. The findings revealed a positive correlation between MPV and HbA1c, and MPV and 
microvascular complications, including diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy.
3. MPV is an accessible biomarker that can be used in clinical practice to assess glycaemic control in 
patients with T2D, help clinicians predict morbidity and mortality, and allow for earlier interventions to 
reduce the risk of developing associated microvascular complications.

of Medicine, Gandhi Medical College and 
associated Hamidia Hospital, Bhopal, India, 
during the study period of 18 months (from 
January 2021–June 2022). All the patients 
diagnosed as per American Diabetes Association 
(ADA) criteria, over 18 years, with HbA1c >6.5%, 
fasting plasma glucose >126 mg/dL, post-2 hour 
blood glucose (after 75 g glucose) >200 mg/dL, 
and random blood glucose >200 mg/dL were 
included. Individuals with abnormal platelet count 
<1.5 lacs/µL or >4 lacs/µL; with known bleeding/
clotting disorders; taking drugs affecting platelet 
function like antiplatelet drugs, statins, anti-
coagulants, etc.; with chronic liver disease; any 
malignancy; and pregnant females were excluded 
from the study. 
The study was initiated after obtaining ethical 
clearance from the Institute’s ethical committee. 
A total of 300 cases were enrolled. All the 
patients were then subjected to detailed history 
and clinical examination. Plasma glucose levels 
were calculated using glucose oxidase method, 
and HbA1c using high performance liquid 
chromatography. MPV was measured using 
automated haematology blood counter from 
Mindray (Mindray Global, Shenzhen, China). 
Based on the HbA1c levels, patients were 
categorised in three groups: 6.5–8.0%, 8.1–10.0%, 
and >10.0%. Fundoscopy was done to look 
for retinopathy. Apart from this, urine routine 
microscopy and 24-hour urine protein was also 
done to look for nephropathy. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
Data was recorded in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, 
Redmond, Washington, USA) and statistical 
analysis was performed by the SPSS program 
for Windows, version 25 (IBM, Armonk, New 
York, USA). Continuous variables were presented 
as mean±standard deviation, and categorical 
variables were presented as absolute numbers 
and percentage. Categorical variables were 
analysed using either the χ2 test or Fisher’s  
exact test. Continuous variables were assessed 
using analysis of variance or independent  
sample t-test. Pearson correlation (r) was 
performed to establish the correlation between 
different parameters. P<0.05 was considered  
statistically significant. 
RESULTS 
The study was conducted on a total of 300 
patients with T2D with a mean age of  
56.6±8.6 years. 
The majority of patients with T2D belonged to 
age group 51–60 years (47%), followed by 61–70 
years (22.7%). Approximately 52% were females 
and 50.3% of the participants had hypertension. 
The majority (68%) of the participants had BMI 
between 18.5–24.9 kg/m2 and mean BMI was 
21.79 kg/m2. The majority of the patients with 
T2D had HbA1c between 8.1–10.0% (51.7%)  
and 30.0% of the patients had HbA1c above 
10.0% (Table 1).
On comparing the MPV level with the glycaemic 
control, it was revealed that those with higher 
HbA1c level had higher MPV (p<0.001).  
Similarly, MPV was significantly higher in  
patients with prolonged duration of diabetes 
(p<0.050; Table 2).
On comparing diabetes duration among HbA1c 
category for MPV, it was observed that patients 
with diabetes duration between 1–5 years, and 
HbA1c level >10 had higher MPV than the lower 
HbA1c values. A similar trend was observed for 
6–10 and >10 years of diabetes duration where 
MPV increased with increasing HbA1c level 
(p<0.05). However, there was no significant 
difference in MPV in different duration of 
diabetes with similar HbA1c. 
In the authors’ study, patients with advanced 
diabetic retinopathy and with significant 
proteinuria (nephropathy) had higher MPV  
than those with early diabetic changes and  
those with <150 mg/dL proteinuria  
(p<0.05; Table 3).
Pearson correlation revealed a significant 
positive correlation of fasting blood sugar 
(r=0.804), postprandial blood sugar (r=0.745), 
random blood sugar (r=0.799), HbA1c (r=0.860), 
duration of diabetes (r=0.174), proteinuria 
(r=0.651), and abnormal fundus findings 
(r=0.335) with MPV (p<0.05).

DISCUSSION 
MPV is an efficient, easily available, and 
cost-effective marker, which can be used in 
monitoring glycaemic status in patients with T2D. 
This was an observational study on 300 patients 
with diabetes with mean age of 56.64±8.69 
years. The majority of individuals in this study 
who had T2D had HbA1c that ranged between 
8.1–10.0% (51.7%). When the MPV level was 
compared with the glycaemic control, it was 
discovered that those with a higher HbA1c level 
had a greater MPV (p<0.001). This provides 
evidence that an increasing MPV can be a sign of 
poor glycaemic control. 
Swaminathan et al.9 also discovered that the 
difference between the MPV in patients with 
diabetes and without diabetes was statistically 
significant. In patients with diabetes, the MPV 
was found to be 10.200±0.770, whereas in those 
without diabetes, the MPV was 9.816±0.400. 
According to Kodiatte et al.,10 the mean HbA1c 
level in the diabetes group was 9.130±2.530%, 
while the level in the non-diabetic group 
was 5.950±0.723% (p<0.001). MPV was 
significantly greater in the patients with diabetes 
(8.290±0.735 fL) compared with the non-diabetic 
group (7.470±0.726 fL), which was statistically 
significant (p<0.001). 
Saluja et al.11 reported that among the subjects 
with diabetes, a positive statistical Pearson 
correlation was seen between MPV and HbA1c 
levels and fasting blood sugar levels.11 
In the current study, increased duration of 
diabetes also correlated with increasing MPV. 
Also in the same group of duration MPV showed 
a positive correlation with increasing HbA1c. 
For duration of 1–5 years, 6–10 years, and >10 
years, the MPV increased with increasing HbA1c 
levels. Patients with durations ranging from 1–5 
years, 6–10 years, and >10 years had respective 
MPV values of 10.503±1.040, 10.790±0.934, and 
10.979±1.428. It can be seen here that there 
is a statistically significant upward trend in the 
proportion of MPV with increasing duration of 
diabetes. Platelet parameters between people

with diabetes with diabetic duration <10 years 
and those with diabetic duration >10 years 
showed that MPV was significantly increased in 
people with diabetes with duration of disease 
>10 years, as reported by Swaminathan et al.9 in 
their study. However, in the study by Kodiatte et 
al.,10 they came to the conclusion that there was 
no correlation between MPV and the length of 
diabetes, or the existence of complications.  
It was stated by Saluja et al.11 that the mean 
HbA1c in patients who had diabetes for more 
than 5 years was 8.62±0.96, while among 
patients who had diabetes for less than 5 
years it was 8.51±1.09 (p=0.49). According 
to the findings of Saluja et al.,11 there is not a 
statistically significant link between MPV and  
the length of diabetes (p=0.50).
In the current study, an independent association 
between the risk of microvascular problems and 
the MPV was found in patients with T2D. When 
the MPV level was compared with the presence 
of proteinuria (which is suggestive of diabetic 
nephropathy), it was found that those with the 
presence of proteinuria had a higher MPV than 
those without proteinuria. On the other hand, 
the MPV was significantly higher in the group 
that contained less than 150 mg/dL of protein 
(MPV: 11.670), in contrast to the group that had 
more than 150 mg/dL of protein (MPV: 10.096), 
which suggested that MPV did not increase with 
increase in proteinuria. 
In the current study, the MPV was found 
to be significantly higher in the group that 
had advanced diabetic retinopathy (11.148), 
compared with the group that had early 
diabetic changes (10.934). This difference was 
statistically significant (p<0.001), which also 
suggested a positive correlation between MPV 
and diabetic retinopathy. Saluja et al.11 reported 
that the MPV in subjects with complications 
(13.12±1.40 fL) was higher than the MPV in 
subjects without complications (12.80±1.21 fL), 
despite the fact that an independent  
student t-test did not show any statistical  
significance (p=0.13). 
CONCLUSION 
Patients with diabetes who have higher HbA1c 
have higher values of MPV compared with 
those who have lower HbA1c, which is a marker 
for diabetes control. Also, MPV correlates 
positively with duration of diabetes and with 
presence of microvascular complications in 
the authors’ study. Hence, the measurement 
of MPV in patients with T2D can be a good 
marker of control of diabetes and of probability 
of microvascular complications. Therefore, it 
can assist clinicians to anticipate morbidity and 
mortality associated with the disease. As MPV is 
widely available as a part of the complete blood 
count report, it can be easily used, especially in 
resource-limited settings. 
LIMITATION 
Absence of a healthy control group is a limitation 
of the study. Macrovascular complications 
were not taken into consideration as most 
patients with cardiovascular diseases were on 
antiplatelets, which would alter the MPV values 
and hence they were excluded from the study.
