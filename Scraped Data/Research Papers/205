ABSTRACT 
Background: Aim of study was to evaluate the impact of myoinositol and D-chiro inositol plus vitamin D 
supplementation on the prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women. 
Methods: In the multi-centric, prospective, randomised, double-blind clinical trial, either vitamin D alone (group I) or 
myoinositol and D-chiro inositol plus Vitamin D (group II) were administered to pregnant women from 12 weeks of 
gestation. The administration was continued until delivery to primigravids who were normoglycemic at 12 weeks of 
gestation and consented. From October 2018 to December 2019. A total of 1250 women were enrolled, and randomly 
allocated to either of the groups: 630 women in Group I and 620 in Group II. The allocation was blinded. The primary 
outcome was the rate of GDM as assessed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) recommended by diabetes in pregnancy 
Study Group India (DIPSI), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the Government of 
India, at first antenatal visit followed by at weeks 24 to 28 in both the groups.  
Results: The rate of GDM was found more in group I as compared to group II treated with myoinositol and D-chiro 
Inositol plus vitamin D, but the difference was not statistically significant (5.08% in group I and 3.22% in group II). 
Conclusions: In conclusion, an improved trend has been noticed in the reduction of the rate of GDM with myoinositol 
and D-chiro inositol plus vitamin D as compared to vitamin D alone. Myoinositol and D-chiro inositol plus vitamin D 
supplementation may be a good option for pregnant women to prevent the GDM occurrence especially in women having 
positive risk factors for GDM.

INTRODUCTION 
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is defined as 
“Impaired Glucose Tolerance with onset or first 
recognition during pregnancy”.1,2 A recent population-
based cohort study, conducted in 2022 reported the 
gestational diabetes prevalence from 7% to 16% in India. 
A study conducted in 2013 across India by the Federation 
of Obstetricians and Gynecologist Society of India 
(FOGSI) and Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India 
(DIPSI) reported diagnosis of GDM in 740 (8%) women 
out of 9282 pregnant women enrolled. In addition, 27% of 
these women diagnosed with GDM reported history of 
foetal loss in previous pregnancy.2,4 Asians and Indians are 
at higher risk of developing diabetes mellitus, so pregnant 
women are also at higher risk of developing GDM.5 In 
India, GDM is reported in a large number of pregnancies 
(around 4 million pregnancies in a year), exposing them to 
the risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality if not 
managed appropriately.2 
Pregnant women with increased hyperglycemia exhibit an 
increased risk of adverse maternal, fetal and neonatal 
outcomes.6 The maternal risks are pre-eclampsia, 
polyhydramnios, postpartum haemorrhage, uterine atony, 
prolonged/obstructed labour, progression of retinopathy 
and infection. The fetal risks include intra-uterine death, 
spontaneous abortion, congenital malformation, stillbirth, 
birth injuries, shoulder dystocia, infant respiratory distress 
syndrome and neonatal hypoglycemia. This emphasises 
the need for early diagnosis or prevention of GDM.  
India has a high prevalence of GDM by global standards, 
healthcare resources are insufficient, and the variations in 
sociodemographic characteristics impact the prevalence of 
GDM. The International Federation of Gynecology and 
Obstetrics (FIGO) has redefined GDM as hyperglycemia 
in pregnancy (HIP). The FIGO guidelines endorsed the 
guidelines of the Government of India (GOI), the Diabetes 
in Pregnancy Group in India (DIPSI), and the Federation 
of Obstetrics and Gynecological Societies of India 
(FOGSI) for low resource countries like India. They 
recommend GDM/ HIP testing of all pregnant women 
(universal testing) at the first initial antenatal contact and 
24–28 weeks’ gestation using the one-step 75-g OGTT 
procedure whether in a fasting or non-fasting state.7-9 
The management of GDM involves an integrative 
approach with dietary modifications, physical activity 
along with psychosocial interventions.10 When this 
approach does not work, insulin is required with or without 
the addition of an oral hypoglycemic agent.11 There is a 
need for treatments including nutritional supplements 
which can prevent occurrence of gestational diabetes or 
hyperglycemia in pregnancy. The treatments must be 
effective, safe in pregnancy and do not cause any side 
effects. Additionally, nutritional supplements will improve 
patient compliance being oral supplements, unlike 
parenteral administration of insulin. 
Myoinositol (MI) is a cyclic polyol linked to phospholipids 
and found naturally in plants and animals. It is converted 
into its isomer D-chiro-inositol (DCI) in the tissues that 
express the epimerase enzyme.12 These isomers serve as 
second 
messengers 
of 
insulin 
in 
glycosyl-
phosphatidylinositol 
and 
inositol 
phosphoglycans 
pathways.13 Myoinositol is reported to be beneficial in 
GDM by improving insulin resistance.14,15 In addition, MI 
stimulates the translocation of GLUT-4 to the plasma 
membrane of skeletal muscles, leading to increased 
glucose uptake in the cells.16 One of the studies reported 
that MI supplementation during the first trimester in 
pregnant obese (BMI 30 or more) women reduced the 
incidence of GDM significantly.17 Another study in 
pregnant women with a family history of diabetes has 
shown that supplementation of MI reduces the incidence 
of GDM significantly and delivery of macrosomia 
foetuses.18 The Cochrane analysis also suggests that 
antenatal supplementation of MI during pregnancy is 
beneficial in reducing the incidence of GDM.19 In addition, 
a recent study has suggested that supplementation of MI 
plus α-lactalbumin in pregnant women with GDM reduces 
insulin resistance as assessed by reduction in homeostasis 
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values and 
amount of insulin usage in these women. Authors also 
reported a decline in subcutaneous adipose tissue 
deposition and fetal abdominal circumference, along with 
a decrease in pre-term births.20 
Thus, we carried out a randomised, double-blind clinical 
trial to assess the impact of MI + DCI + vitamin D3 
(vitamin D) supplementation in preventing GDM 
occurrence in pregnant women.  
METHODS 
A multi-centric, prospective, randomised, double-blind 
study was carried out in primigravid pregnant women. 
Local ethics committee approvals were taken, and the trial 
was conducted according to the principles expressed in the 
Helsinki Declaration. All the participants gave written 
informed consent. The CONSORT Statement has been 
adhered to, and the trial was registered in Clinical Trials 
Registry-India 
(CTRI) 
(Registration 
No.: 
CTRI/2018/06/014477). The study was carried out at five 
centres, viz. Al Ameen Medical College (ALM), Bijapur; 
Divakar’s Speciality Hospital (DSH), Bengaluru; Gupte 
Hospital (GHP), Pune; Karnataka Institute of Medical 
Sciences (KIMS), Hubali and Radha Krishna Hospital 
(RKH), Bangalore. ALM, KIMS and RKH are public 
hospitals, while DSH and GHP are private hospitals. 
GDM testing 
The participants ingested 75 g of glucose that had been 
dissolved in 300 ml water. After 2 h, the participants’ 
venous blood glucose levels were measured. GDM was 
diagnosed if the blood glucose levels were >7.8 mmol/L or 
>140 mg/dL. GDM testing was carried out at the following 
time points: during the first antenatal visit in the first

trimester, and in the second trimester during weeks 24 to 
28 weeks. 
Inclusion criteria 
The inclusion criteria were a) Pregnant women 
primigravida; b) Gestation between 11-14 weeks; c) First 
glucose values <140 mg/dl as determined using a single 
step OGTT procedure which DIPSI, International 
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and 
Government of India recommend d) Willingness to 
provide the informed consent; and e) Willingness and 
ability to follow the study procedures.1,2 
Exclusion criteria 
The exclusion criteria were a) Previous abortion; b) 
Multigravida; c) First glucose values >140 mg/dl; d) 
Subjects with a known history of diabetes, and e) 
Pregestational morbid obesity (BMI over 35).  
A simple computer-generated random sampling method 
was used with an allocation of 1:1 in each group. Group I 
received only vitamin D (1000 IU), while group II was the 
treatment arm that received the combination of MI (2 gms) 
+ DCI (50 mg) + Vit D (1000 IU) twice a day 
(GDMSafe®, Shield Healthcare Pvt Ltd). Lower levels of 
Vit D have been reported to be associated with a higher 
risk of GDM.21 Further, vitamin D supplement effectively 
reduces GDM occurrence possibly by increasing insulin 
sensitivity.22 
The 
supplementation 
was 
started 
immediately post-enrollment according to the assigned 
groups and continued till delivery in all the women. The 
primary outcome was the rate of GDM in pregnant women 
as determined by the single-step OGTT. Each participant 
was given sachets, which were identical in appearance. 
The sponsor supplied the sealed and numbered sachets 
according 
to 
the 
computer-generated 
randomised 
sequence. The unblinding was done by the sponsor after 
the database lock.  
Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was carried out with R software version 
4.1.0. Data are expressed as n (%) for categorical variables 
and n, mean ± standard deviation (SD) for numerical 
variables. Inferential analysis was carried out using the 
two-sample t-test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered 
significant.  
RESULTS 
During the enrollment period from October 2018 to 
December 2019, a total of 1707 women were screened for 
eligibility. A total of 1250 women were enrolled in the 
study, and randomly allocated to either of the groups: 630 
women in Group I and 620 in Group II. A total of 957 
pregnant women were available for the second OGTT, 492 
women from Group I, and 465 from Group II (Figure 1).  
 
Figure 1: Flowchart of participants. 
A total of 293 pregnant women were either lost to follow-
up or discontinued the study or withdraw consent. 
The maximum number of women were in the age group of 
21 to 25 years. There were no significant differences 
between the groups with respect to mean age and BMI 
(Table 1). The mean glucose values for group I (received 
vitamin D) and Group II (treatment arm) at baseline were 
similar (Table 2).

Two centres which are public hospitals had (KIMS and 
RKH) zero incidence of GDM and ALM centre the other 
public hospital had a 0.5% versus 0.6 % rate of GDM. The 
rate of GDM observed by these three centres is 
significantly less than the other two centres (DSH and 
GHP) which are private hospitals. We could not identify 
the cause for such a low rate of GDM in the three public 
hospitals 
DISCUSSION 
The current study proved that MI plus DCI plus vitamin D 
supplementation showed the trend of reducing the 
occurrence of GDM in pregnant women, but the reduction 
is not statistically significant compared to vitamin D alone. 
The previous studies reported that MI supplementation in 
pregnant women who were overweight or obese (BMI 30 
or more) significantly reduced the incidence of GDM by 
lowering insulin resistance.19 Similarly, women with 
elevated fasting glucose levels during the first or early 
second trimester, supplementation with MI decreased the 
incidence of GDM significantly along with improved 
secondary outcomes like insulin therapy, neonatal 
hypoglycaemia and polyhydramnios. To best of our 
knowledge, this was the first clinical study conducted in 
pregnant women in India to assess the benefit of MI plus 
DCI plus vitamin D supplementation in reducing the GDM 
occurrence. MI plus DCI plus vitamin D supplementation 
was well tolerated, without any adverse event reported in 
this study. By reducing the GDM occurrence, the 
subsequent benefit in reducing the adverse maternal, fetal 
and neonatal outcomes by MI plus DCI plus vitamin D 
supplementation must not be ignored. 
The rate of GDM in the current study was 5.08% and 
3.22% in group I and group II, respectively, which was 
definitely less than the reported studies in literature but the 
difference between the two arms was not statistically 
significant.  
In our study, the rate of GDM in private and public 
hospitals was found to be 12.00% and 0.29%, respectively, 
in group I, while it was 7.04% and 0.38%, respectively, in 
group II treatment arm. The difference in the rate of GDM 
between private and public hospitals is difficult to 
rationalise. This suggests that more extensive studies are

needed with larger and equal sample sizes in private and 
public hospitals.  
The current study is associated with certain limitations. 
Documented 
evidence 
has 
suggested 
that 
MI 
supplementation showed a significant reduction in GDM 
occurrence in women carrying risk factors for GDM. 
These risk factors include obese or overweight pregnant 
women, pregnant women with elevated fasting glucose 
levels at baseline, pregnant women with a family history 
of type II diabetes or women with advanced age.19,22 
However, in our study, all the pregnant primigravida 
women were enrolled without identifiable risk factors. 
Furthermore, several studies have reported that GDM 
occurrence increases with age and is higher in females 
aged 30 years or more.23,24 Almost 90% of the pregnant 
women in our study were less than 30 years of age, and 
approximately 70% were in the age grope of 18 to 25 
years. 
This warrants a study in a larger population with equal 
distribution of pregnant women from all age groups and 
with associated risk factors. Studies recruiting women 
equally from both public and private hospitals will help 
identify the beneficial effects of MI in preventing GDM. 
In addition, we did not measure other clinical outcomes 
like gestational hypertension, macrosomia, or neonatal 
hypoglycaemia. 
CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, an improved trend has been noticed in the 
reduction of the rate of GDM with MI + DCI + Vit D as 
compared to Vit D alone. However, the role of MI + DCI 
+ Vit D in reducing GDM occurrence and subsequently 
reducing adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes 
must not be ignored. The authors opine that MI + DCI + 
Vit D supplementation may be a good option for the 
prevention of GDM in pregnant women with positive risk 
factors.
