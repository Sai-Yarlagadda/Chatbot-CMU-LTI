Abstract: A strategy combining intercritical quenching, pre-tempering, and tempering processes
was implemented to optimize the microstructures and mechanical properties of 5CrNiMoV steel.
By intercritically quenching at 1050 ◦C, pr-tempering at 600 ◦C, and tempering at 550 ◦C, the steel
exhibited a comprehensive performance with a yield strength of 1120 MPa, an ultimate tensile
strength of 1230 MPa, and an elongation of 8.2%. The high strength of the steel is attributed to the
presence of tempered martensite and abundant secondary carbides. The favorable ductility is mainly
provided by the pearlite inherited from intercritical quenching and tempering. Additionally, the
precipitation of secondary carbides not only enhances precipitation strengthening, but also reduces
the dislocation density and lattice strain of the matrix, thereby enhancing strength and ductility. This
study offers a scheme for producing strong and ductile 5CrNiMoV steel.

1. Introduction
5CrNiMoV is a low alloy martensitic die steel that is commonly used in the man-
ufacturing of tools for forging, extrusion, and die-casting processes [1,2]. Tools made
from this steel are exposed to high pressure, friction, and multiple thermal cycles during
the hot forming of materials. These harsh operating conditions often lead to a limited
lifespan for tools [3,4]. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the mechanical properties of
5CrNiMoV steel.
As is well known, the microstructure of steel and alloys plays a crucial role in deter-
mining their mechanical properties, and this is widely recognized. In the case of 5CrNiMoV
steel, the microstructure typically consists of martensite and dispersed secondary carbides
that are formed during the process of quenching-tempering (QT) heat treatment. It is im-
portant to note that the type, morphology, distribution, and average size of these secondary
carbides signiﬁcantly impact the operational lifespan and reliability of the die steel [4–6].
In recent years, several researchers have investigated the impact of heat treatment
on the microstructure and secondary carbides of die steels, as well as its effect on their
mechanical properties [7–10]. During the QT treatment, the prior austenite grain size
(PAGS) and volume fraction of carbides are inﬂuenced by the quenching temperature, while
the martensite morphology and secondary carbides size are inﬂuenced by the tempering
temperature [7]. It has been observed that increasing the tempering temperature leads to the
precipitation and coarsening of spherical carbides in the martensite lath [8]. Additionally,
Zhu et al. [9] proposed that the pre-tempering process can reﬁne the tempered martensite
and carbides of H13 die steel. The ﬁndings indicate that ﬁne grains, lath martensite, and
carbides contribute to the ductility and strength of H13 die steel [9,10].
Moreover, recent research has reported that steel containing a microstructure consist-
ing of at least two distinct transformation products can attain both high strength and high
ductility [11–13]. Sun et al. [11] demonstrated that a layered structure of martensite and

ultraﬁne-grained ferrite can circumvent the strength-toughness trade-off typically observed
in low-alloyed steel. The ﬁndings reveal that in comparison to a tempered martensitic
microstructure, the martensite and ultraﬁne-grained ferrite layered microstructure exhibit
a signiﬁcant enhancement in impact toughness. Furthermore, He et al. [12] and Li et al. [13]
successfully developed medium-manganese steels featuring a reﬁned austenite and marten-
site structure. This advanced medium-manganese steel boasts an ultimate tensile strength
exceeding 2000 MPa and an elongation surpassing 20%.
Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the microstructural evolution of 5CrN-
iMoV steel is of paramount importance. However, limited efforts have been made to
elucidate the methodology for controlling the tempered martensitic microstructure in
5CrNiMoV steel. Consequently, this study aims to propose an optimal heat treatment
route to enhance its microstructures and mechanical properties. An intercritical quenching
process—followed by high-temperature pre-tempering and low-temperature tempering—
is developed. Furthermore, employing optical microscope (OM) and scanning electron
microscope (SEM) observations, along with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) analyses, the microstructure evolution and precipitation behavior of
secondary carbides during the heat treatment of 5CrNiMoV steel are thoroughly examined
and discussed.

Phase transformation temperatures of the 5CrNiMoV steel were investigated using
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (STA 449F3 Jupiter). During the
measurement, the specimen was heated from 25 ◦C to 1100 ◦C at a rate of 10 ◦C/s, and the
heat ﬂow rate to the specimen was monitored. In addition, a quenching and deformation
dilatometer (DIL 805, TA instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) was used to carry out the
thermal expansion tests of the steel. The specimens used for the thermal expansion test
are 10 mm in height and 4 mm in diameter. During the test, the specimens were heated to
950 ◦C, 1050 ◦C, and 1100 ◦C, respectively, at a heating rate of 10 ◦C/s, kept for 5 min, and
then cooled at a linear rate of 50 ◦C/s. The results of the dilatometer tests show that the Ms
temperature is 240 ◦C and the Mf is lower than room temperature.
2.2. Heat Treatment Process
Firstly, the specimens were heated to either 1050 ◦C or 1100 ◦C and held at these
temperatures for 30 min. Subsequently, they were quenched in oil, as shown in Figure 1a.
After the quenching process, the specimens underwent pre-tempering and tempering
treatments. In the pre-tempering stage, the specimen was reheated to a temperature of
either 550 or 600 ◦C and hold for 120 min, followed by air cooling. Subsequently, the
specimen was reheated to a temperature that was equal to or lower than the pre-tempering
temperature (550 or 600 ◦C). Then, an intercritical quenching method was proposed to
produce a mixed structure of pearlite and martensite in the 5CrNiMoV steel. This method
involves quenching the specimen after isothermal holding at 1050 ◦C for 30 min. The
quenching process was performed by rapidly immersing the specimen into a quenching
oil at a temperature of about 100 ◦C for a duration of 10 s. Subsequently, the intercritically
quenched specimen underwent pre-tempering and tempering treatments, as shown in
Figure 1b.

Additionally, the strength of 5CrNiMoV steel is inﬂuenced by precipitation strength-
ening, which is caused by the formation of secondary carbides. To determine the appro-
priate tempering conditions, the researchers referred to the equilibrium phase diagram of 
the 5CrNiMoV steel, as depicted in Figure 2. It was observed that due to the low silicon 
content, the formation of cementite is more favorable compared to other carbides [14]. 
However, in terms of contributing to the strength of the die steel, the carbides MC and 
M23C6 play a more signiﬁcant role than cementite. Based on the information provided in 
Figure 2, it was found that the carbides M23C6 and MC remain stable within the tempera-
ture range of 550 °C to 650 °C. Therefore, for this research, the tempering temperature was 
selected from a range of 550 °C to 600 °C.

The DSC curve, shown in Figure 4b, exhibits two endothermic valleys. Previous studies
have reported that the transformation of ferrite to austenite, carbide dissolution, and grain
growth are all endothermic processes [16,17]. Therefore, the ﬁrst endothermic valley in the
DSC curve corresponds to the austenite transformation, while the second one corresponds
to the grain growth and dissolution of carbides.

It is worth noting that the DSC curve does not exhibit an exothermic reaction until 
the temperature reaches approximately 1050 °C. This suggests that the complete dissolu-
tion of carbides only occurs when the temperature reaches 1050 °C.

The presence of undissolved Cr-rich carbide reduces the chromium content in the 
matrix structure, leading to an inhomogeneous microstructure. This inhomogeneity is det-
rimental to the strength of steel. As depicted in Figure 6, the specimen quenched at 950 °C 
exhibits the lowest hardness, measuring at (52 ± 1) HRC. This decrease in hardness is at-
tributed to the undissolved carbides (Figure 5a), which reduce the alloying elements 
within the quenching martensite, consequently resulting in a decrease in martensitic hard-
ness. Upon quenching at 1050 °C, the martensitic hardness reaches its peak, measuring at 
(59 ± 1) HRC. However, when quenched at 1100 °C, the hardness declines to (57 ± 1) HRC. 
This reduction in hardness is associated with excessive quenching temperature, which 
leads to the coarsening of prior austenite grains and subsequently decreases the hardness 
of the specimen. The results indicate that the presence of undissolved Cr-rich carbides in 
specimens quenched at lower temperatures results in an inhomogeneous microstructure 
and a decrease in hardness. Conversely, excessive quenching temperature causes prior 
austenite grain coarsening and a subsequent decline in hardness. Therefore, a quenching 
temperature of 1050 °C is considered reasonable for 5CrNiMoV steel.

to S1100-550-550. It is observed that with an increase in quenching temperature, the UTS
and YS decline from 1375 MPa to 1330 MPa and 1290 MPa to 1200 MPa, respectively.
Simultaneously, the EL decreases from 4.0% to 3.0%. This can be attributed to two factors.
Firstly, the PAGS and martensite block size augment with an increase in quenching temper-
ature, thereby diminishing the YS of the quenched steel as per the Hall–Petch relation [18].
Secondly, the coarsened grains of the prior austenite and martensite blocks are suscepti-
ble to initiating micro-cracks during tensile tests, leading to intergranular fracture, and
consequently reducing the EL [19,20].
Upon comparing S1050-550-550 and S1050-600-600, it is evident that as the pre-
tempering and tempering temperatures increase, the EL also increases. Concurrently,
the UTS and YS decreased signiﬁcantly. This is linked to the aggregation and coarsening of
the secondary carbides and decomposition of the tempered martensite induced by elevated
tempering temperatures. Despite S1050-600-600 possessing high EL, the low YS severely
hampers the application of the 5CrNiMoV steel.
Tempering is an effective method to modify precipitation behavior for enhancing the
mechanical properties of die steels. By modulating the tempering conditions, S1050-600-550
exhibits exceptional mechanical properties, with an UTS of 1230 MPa, YS of 1120 MPa, and
EL of 7.0%. Additionally, based on the aforementioned optimized parameters, the EL is
further ameliorated with intercritical quenching. As delineated in Table 2, S1050L-600-550
boasts the highest EL of 8.2%, with an UTS of 1220 MPa and YS of 1110 MPa, showing
better mechanical properties and can meet diverse engineering requirements.
3.3. Microstructures
Figure 8 illustrates the OM and SEM micrographs of S1100-550-550 and S1050-550-550,
which have been quenched at varying temperatures. The microstructure is comprised of
ferrite, tempered martensite, and secondary carbides. As shown in Figure 8a,b, a small
amount of ferrite is distributed along the austenite grain boundaries, which is an important
reference substance to measure the PAGS. Post-measurement, the PAGS of the specimens
quenched at 1050 ◦C and 1100 ◦C are (156 ± 8) µm and (188 ± 16) µm, respectively.
The migration ability of grain boundaries is enhanced at higher temperatures, thereby
promoting grain growth. Consequently, the PAGS of S1100-550-550 is larger than that of
S1050-550-550. During tempering, grain boundaries become the preferred nucleation sites
for carbide precipitation [20]. Figure 8c,d reveals that the tempered martensite is composed
of martensitic lath and secondary carbides. The secondary carbide size of S1050-550-550
is small (Figure 8c). Figure 8d demonstrates that with the rise in quenching temperature,
the lath structure becomes more distinct due to the PAGS increase. Film-like carbides
precipitate along the lath boundaries, forming numerous hard boundaries between the
tempered martensite laths. Given that the hardness of the tempered martensite matrix
is inferior to that of secondary carbides, the stress concentration at the lath boundaries
intensiﬁes during tensile deformation [21]. It causes micro-cracks to form and propagate
along the lath boundaries, resulting in the swift fracture of S1100-550-550. Hence, the EL of

size of S1050-550-550 is small (Figure 8c). Figure 8d demonstrates that with the rise in 
quenching temperature, the lath structure becomes more distinct due to the PAGS increase. 
Film-like carbides precipitate along the lath boundaries, forming numerous hard bound-
aries between the tempered martensite laths. Given that the hardness of the tempered 
martensite matrix is inferior to that of secondary carbides, the stress concentration at the 
lath boundaries intensiﬁes during tensile deformation [21]. It causes micro-cracks to form 
and propagate along the lath boundaries, resulting in the swift fracture of S1100-550-550. 
Hence, the EL of S1100-550-550 is exceedingly low.

Figure 9 presents OM and SEM micrographs of S1050-600-600 and S1050-600-550, 
which have been tempered at diﬀerent temperatures. Owing to the identical quenching 
temperatures, the average diameters of PAGBs of S1050-600-600 and S1050-600-550 are 
closely similar: (161 ± 10) µm and (165 ± 7) µm, respectively (Figure 9a,b). However, the

Figure 9 presents OM and SEM micrographs of S1050-600-600 and S1050-600-550,
which have been tempered at different temperatures. Owing to the identical quenching
temperatures, the average diameters of PAGBs of S1050-600-600 and S1050-600-550 are
closely similar: (161 ± 10) µm and (165 ± 7) µm, respectively (Figure 9a,b). However, the
morphology and average size of the secondary carbides vary with the tempering tempera-
ture. Figure 9c shows that when both the pre-tempering and tempering temperatures are
600 ◦C, the secondary carbides noticeably aggregated and coarse. Additionally, the decom-

to a decline in the YS of S1050-600-600, which is 670 MPa. Figure 9d indicates that with
a reduction in tempering temperature, the secondary carbide size signiﬁcantly decreases.
Furthermore, secondary carbides are observed not only along lath boundaries but also
within martensitic laths. This suggests that pre-tempering at 600 ◦C promotes the precipita-
tion nucleation of carbides. Subsequent tempering at 550 ◦C not only continues to promote
precipitation, but also inhibits the coarsening of the carbides. Therefore, S1050-600-550
exhibits a favorable combination of ductility and strength (Figure 7).

pered martensite and pearlite. Due to intercritical quenching, only a portion of austenite is
transformed into martensite, while the remainder is converted into pearlite during the sub-

µm. However, the lower tempering temperature is not conducive to carbide precipitation.
Thus, in S1050-550-550, the volume fraction of the secondary carbides is merely 11%. In
S1100-550-550, the precipitation of a large number of strip-like carbides leads to an increase
in both the average size and volume fraction of the secondary carbides. In S1050-600-600,
the coarsened secondary carbides are caused by a higher tempering temperature, which is
detrimental to the mechanical properties of die steel and should be avoided.

As shown in Figure 14, the average values of the lattice constant for the heat-treated
specimens range from 2.8669 to 2.8681 Å. Notably, the lattice constant value exhibits an
inverse relationship with the volume fraction of the secondary carbides. This observation
is consistent with the information presented in Figures 11b and 14, where it is evident that
a higher volume fraction of secondary carbides corresponds to a smaller lattice constant.
The increase in the volume fraction of secondary carbides with a decrease in the lattice
constant can be attributed to the reduction in the content of solid solution alloying elements
within the α-Fe matrix. As the volume fraction of secondary carbides increases, the amount
of solid solution alloying elements decreases, leading to a reduction in lattice distortion.
Consequently, the lattice constant decreases accordingly. In the case of S1050L-600-550, it
undergoes intercritical quenching and tempering treatment, resulting in the formation of
microstructures consisting of tempered martensite and pearlite. This speciﬁc heat treatment
process promotes the precipitation of a signiﬁcant number of carbides, leading to a smaller
lattice constant.

quenching temperatures. As shown in Figure 15a, the crystallite size increases with an
increase in the pre-tempering temperature, while the lattice strain decreases. This reduction
in lattice strain subsequently leads to a decrease in the dislocation density within the
martensite matrix (Figure 15b,c). Furthermore, there is a negligible difference in the lattice
strain, crystallite size, and dislocation density between S1050-600-550 and S1050-600-600.

This observation demonstrates that these parameters are predominantly inﬂuenced by
the pre-tempering temperature. As shown in Figures 11b and 15, a higher pre-tempering
temperature promotes the precipitation of carbides, thereby diminishing the lattice strain
and dislocation density of the matrix, which is beneﬁcial for enhancing the ductility of the
5CrNiMoV steel. Additionally, tempering following the pre-tempering process further en-
hances the precipitation of carbides. To prevent coarsening of the precipitated carbides, it is
necessary to lower the tempering temperature. Consequently, in S1050-600-550, the higher
volume fraction and ﬁner size of secondary carbides (Figure 11) contribute to an increase
in precipitation strengthening, leading to a relatively high YS. Moreover, the reduction in
lattice strain and dislocation density also enhances the ductility of the specimen. Regarding
S1050L-600-550, the primary microstructures present are tempered martensite and pearlite.

Figure 18 displays the fracture morphology of S1050L-600-550, comprised of dimples,
cleavage facets, and micro-cracks, and demonstrating a ductile-brittle mixed mode [32,35].
Furthermore, a notable increase in the number of dimples in Figure 18a compared to
Figure 17a,c suggests a growing proportion of ductile fracture in S1050L-600-550. Addition-
ally, as shown in Figure 18b, many deep dimples are formed by the pearlite during tensile
deformation, which subsequently delays crack propagation and enhances the EL of the
specimen. Therefore, S1050L-600-550 exhibits a relatively high EL.

This study reveals that by controlling processing parameters, microstructures can be 
tuned to achieve comprehensive mechanical properties. The key conclusions are as fol-
lows: 
(1) Proper heat treatment enhances the mechanical properties of 5CrNiMoV. A balance 
of strength and ductility is achieved with a UTS of 1230 MPa and an EL of 7.0% after 
quenching at 1050 °C, pre-tempering at 600 °C, and tempering at 550 °C. Furthermore, 
intercritical quenching at 1050 °C, pre-tempering at 600 °C, and tempering at 550 °C 
results in a higher EL of 8.2% with a UTS of 1220 MPa. 
(2) Pre-tempering at 600 °C and tempering at 550 °C not only promotes the precipitation 
of carbides, but also inhibits their coarsening, eﬀectively enhancing precipitation 
strengthening and contributing to a 255 MPa increase in the YS. Additionally, the 
decrease in the solid solution of C and Cr elements in the α−Fe matrix due to in-
creased carbide precipitation reduces the lattice micro-strain and dislocation density,

4. Conclusions
This study reveals that by controlling processing parameters, microstructures can be
tuned to achieve comprehensive mechanical properties. The key conclusions are as follows:
(1)
Proper heat treatment enhances the mechanical properties of 5CrNiMoV. A balance of
strength and ductility is achieved with a UTS of 1230 MPa and an EL of 7.0% after
quenching at 1050 ◦C, pre-tempering at 600 ◦C, and tempering at 550 ◦C. Furthermore,
intercritical quenching at 1050 ◦C, pre-tempering at 600 ◦C, and tempering at 550 ◦C
results in a higher EL of 8.2% with a UTS of 1220 MPa.
(2)
Pre-tempering at 600 ◦C and tempering at 550 ◦C not only promotes the precipitation
of carbides, but also inhibits their coarsening, effectively enhancing precipitation

strengthening and contributing to a 255 MPa increase in the YS. Additionally, the
decrease in the solid solution of C and Cr elements in the α-Fe matrix due to increased
carbide precipitation reduces the lattice micro-strain and dislocation density, thereby
improving ductility.
(3)
After intercritical quenching and tempering, the microstructure is composed of tem-
pered martensite and pearlite. The high strength can be ascribed to the tempered
martensite. The enhanced ductility is attributed to the decrease in micro-strain and dis-
location density, as well as the mixed structures of tempered martensite and pearlite,
which serve to hinder crack propagation during tensile deformation.
