Abstract
Reproduction depends on the responses of gonadotropins through their specific receptors. The gonadotropin family has 
three members; Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), and Human Chorionic Gonadotropin 
(hCG). These glycoprotein hormones comprise two subunits, an identical α-subunit and a hormone-specific-β subunit. 
Their cognate receptors (FSHR and LHCGR) are two adrenergic receptor-like family A/rhodopsin-like G-Protein Coupled 
Receptors (GPCRs) with structurally distinct ligand binding domains. The hCG binds to LHCGR but has a longer half-life 
and higher affinity to LHCGR. The expression of FSHR and LHCGR is observed in both gonadal and nongonadal cells. In 
this review, we will be emphasizing the differential expression of gonadotropin receptors in different cells of the human 
body, their specific responses through cross-talk, and how a defect in the expression and activity of FSHR and LHCGR 
may alter the responses of FSH and LH/hCG leading to diseases like PCOS, cancer and metabolic disorders. 
1.  Introduction
Gonadotropins are members of a family of glycoprotein 
hormones, including Follicle Stimulating Hormone 
(FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH)/ Human Chorionic 
Gonadotropin (hCG), and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone 
(TSH). They are critical regulators of the gonadal axis 
for the production of sex hormones, namely estrogen, 
progesterone, and testosterone from gonadal cells (theca 
cells and granulosa cells) (Figure 1). Under the influence 
of hypothalamic secretion of Gonadotropin Releasing 
Hormones (GnRH), the anterior pituitary secretes FSH 
and LH, and the placenta secretes hCG. These hormones 
get secreted in several micro-heterogeneous forms based 
on their molecular weight, half-life, and charge associated 
with different biological properties1. Gonadotropins are 
dimers with a common alpha subunit, and a hormone-
specific beta subunit responsible for specificity of FSH or 
LH for binding to their cognate receptors2. Trophoblast 
cells of the placenta that express hCG take over the 
luteotrophic functions of LH during the first trimester of 
pregnancy to rescue the corpus luteum and maintain the 
progesterone levels3. 
FSH and LH bind to their specific receptors, the 
FSH Receptor (FSHR) and LH Receptor (LHCGR), 
respectively. Both FSHR and LHCGR are members

of the rhodopsin/2-adrenergic receptor-like family A. 
These GPCRs have a short carboxy-terminal intracellular 
domain, a transmembrane domain consisting of 
seven membrane-spanning alpha-helices, and a large 
extracellular amino-terminal domain4. FSHR is an 
essential component in controlling ovarian function 
with its role in follicle formation and stimulating 
estrogen 
production. 
FSH 
stimulates 
aromatase 
enzyme (CYP19A1) in granulosa cells, which converts 
androgens to estrogens. Granulosa cells express ERs, and 
estrogen plays an autocrine/paracrine role in follicular 
growth. The LHCGR regulates steroidogenesis in theca 
cells, oocyte maturation, and ovulation5. 
The receptor is activated when gonadotropin 
hormones bind to the orthosteric site of its GPCR 
receptor, which is positioned in a large horseshoe-
shaped extracellular domain with Leucine-Rich Repeats 
(LRRs). The interaction of the ligand triggers a two-step 
activation mechanism that includes the remodelling of 
the receptor conformation. The alpha and beta subunits 
engage with a sulfated tyrosine residue in the hinge 
region of FSHR, thereby stabilising the ligand-receptor 
complexes to initiate the coupling of the Gαs protein to the 
gonadotropin receptor and activation of the downstream 
canonical cAMP/PKA cascade2,6. All the gonadotropins 
activate the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in target cells, 
associated with trophic effects, mitotic functions, and 
occasionally apoptosis3. Extracellular-regulated kinase 1 
and 2 (ERK1/2) are activations that occur downstream 
of PKA. Moreover, the transcription of target genes, 
including the Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory Protein 
(StAR), is induced by the activation of phosphorylation of 
the cAMP-Responsive Element-Binding protein (CREB) 
to promote steroidogenesis in target cells2,7 (Figure 1). 
The classical pathway of FSH through cAMP/PKA is 
critical for the growth of follicles and the production of 
estradiol. The activation of FSHR or LHCGR by binding 
with FSH and LH, respectively, activates several other

downstream signaling pathways that ultimately lead to 
successful folliculogenesis and ovulation. The Gαq/11 
and inositol triphosphate pathways may also be activated 
by FSHR and LHCGR8. Other pathways, such as the 
ERK pathway and IRS-2/PI3K/AKT pathway in human 
granulosa cells, play crucial role in metabolism and 
follicular growth9 (Figure 2). FSH is more effective than 
LH or hCG in increasing the glucose uptake and storage in 
granulosa cells; however, only FSH increases the glycogen 
synthesis independent of insulin by activating glycogen 
synthase via the IRS-2/PI3K/Akt2 pathway9,10 (Figure 2).
In PCOS women, impairment of the FSHR-IRS-2 
pathway due to high LH or genetic reduction in FSHR 
activation leads to reduced FSH-stimulated glucose 
uptake and glycogen production in granulosa cells9. The 
Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) performed 
on the Han Chinese population revealed that FSHR and 
LHCGR, along with nine other genes, confer significant 
susceptibility to PCOS. These genes were also confirmed 
to pose a risk of PCOS in European women11-13. A study 
by Hwang et al. on Korean women has also confirmed 
that PCOS is associated with the gene variants of FSHR, 
DENN Domain Containing 1A (DENND1A) and 
glycogen synthase 2 (GYS2)14,15.
2.  Differences in LH and HCG 
Responses through LHCGR
LH and hCG bind to the same receptor that is designated 
as LHCGR. However, hCG has a higher affinity than LH, 
and there are differences in the structure and function 
of these hormones. The β-subunit of LH has one Asn-
linked glycosylation. In contrast, hCGβ contains two 
N-linked sites (Asn-13 and Asn-30), which promote the 
dimerization of LHCGR, activating it weakly16. Further, 
the glycosylation of Asn-78 of hCG-β is involved in its 
binding with LHCGR, while the glycosylation of Asn-52 
is important for normal receptor activation. hCGβ has 
a unique carboxyl-terminal peptide with four O-linked 
glycosylations, which increases the half-life of hCG (24h), 
which is ten-fold more than LH (2.4h). hCG is more 
effective than LH in the production of cAMP and the 
involvement of β-arrestin in the downstream signalling of 
LHCGR17. Differences in amino acid sequence between 
the rodent and human LHCGR receptors have little to 
no impact on the rates at which hLH or hCG bind18. An 
exon 10 deletion in LHCGR, which causes structural and 
spatial rearrangements at the hinge region of the receptor, 
is known to alter LH- and hCG-induced signalling 
in distinct ways19. This loss affects LH signaling while 
leaving hCG signaling unaffected, indicating differences 
in the interactions and functions of the hCG and LH 
receptors. Recent research has revealed that the hinge 
region of the receptor interacts differently with hCG and 
LH and that only hCG can cause both cis- and trans-
activation of human LHCGR20,21. Both hCG and LH were 
shown to have a similar rate of association (3×108 −1min−1) 
with LHCGR but distinct dissociation rates (25 hours 
for hCG and approx. 9 hours for hLH), which suggests 
that hCG resides for a longer time on its receptor18. Their 
real-time cAMP measurements demonstrated that the 
two hormones had different kinetics, with Recombinant 
hCG (rhCG) generating faster cAMP responses than 
Recombinant Human LH (rhLH). The findings implied 
that the discrepancies between rhCG- and rhLH 
responses may be explained by the slower dissociation 
rate of rhCG compared to that of rhLH and/or the 
variations in hormone-receptor complex conformations. 
A restricting element for maximum progesterone 
synthesis is β-arrestin. rhLH, like rhCG, is a full agonist 
on LHCGR for the generation of cAMP and testosterone 
but only a partial agonist for the recruitment of β-arrestin 
and the creation of progesterone17.
3.  Expression of Gonadotropin 
Receptors in Gonadal Cells
3.1 FSHR Expression in Granulosa Cells
The expression of FSHR can be observed in the ovarian 
granulosa cells of growing follicles in females and is 
not detected in primordial follicles in ovaries. FSHR 
expression in granulosa cells is observed in the secondary 
follicle stage22. As the follicle develops from the preantral 
to the antral stage, FSHR expression increases, and 
peaks in the mid-follicular phase, and the expression 
may be twice that of the luteal phase23. Antral follicular 
development gets impaired in a hypophysectomised rat 
lacking FSH secretion while having FSHR expression24. In 
FSHR knockout mice, antral follicular development was 
suppressed25,26. The expression of FSHR is also regulated by 
androgens and an oocyte-derived Growth Differentiation 
Factor 9 (GDF9). A study showed that in Rhesus monkey, 
the androgen receptors get co-expressed with FSHR in

172
the same follicles27. Administration of testosterone to the 
rhesus monkey induces the mRNA expression of FSHR 
in granulosa cells, while FSH was shown to stimulate the 
expression of androgen receptors28. GDF9 is a crucial 
factor that contributes to the growth of the follicles from 
the preantral stage to the antral stage by causing androgen 
production in the theca cells29. In an in vitro follicular 
system, knockdown GDF9 suppressed the expression of 
FSHR and induced the apoptosis of granulosa cells, which 
led to arrested follicular growth. However, this arrest was 
rescued by adding GDF9 or androgen, suggesting that 
GDF9 critically regulates FSHR expression in granulosa 
cells and is achieved via androgen signalling30. In the 
rat granulosa cell culture system, estrogen alone did not 
increase LHCGR or alter FSHR expression, but it did 
promote LHCGR expression in the presence of FSH by 
stabilizing the LHR mRNA26. 
3.2  LHCGR Expression in Theca and 
Granulosa Cells
The normal ovarian cycle involves dynamic changes in 
LHCGR expression. LHCGR is expressed in both the 
ovarian granulosa and thecal cells in females; however, 
expression in granulosa cells is very low during the 
follicular phase, and its expression peaks during 
preovulatory stage in response to FSH4,31. When follicles 
grow in response to FSH, estrogen, and other paracrine 
stimuli, LHCGR expression is further increased to 
facilitate successful ovulation5. LHCGR expression is 
momentarily downregulated as estrogen-producing 
granulosa cells differentiate into luteal cells during the 
preovulatory LH surge. The mid-luteal phase is when 
LHCGR expression is at its highest, and progesterone 
production is also increased. The LHCGR levels decrease 
as the corpus luteum regresses4.
LHCGR expression in the granulosa cells is induced 
after FSH stimulation, even though it was previously 
visible in the theca cells from the time that it first 
appeared in the secondary follicle32-34. After FSH induces 
LHCGR expression, many intra-ovarian factors work 
in coordination to boost it and promote follicular 
development to prepared for the LH surge and subsequent 
ovulation (Figure 3). These local factors involve activin, 
Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Insulin-like Growth Factor-1  
(IGF-1), and estrogen26. The ovarian granulosa cells 
express the growth factor activin, a member of the TGF-β 
superfamily, along with the activin receptor. Activin 
has been seen to strongly increase FSHR and CYP19A1 
expression in rat granulosa cells, where it increases the 
FSH-induced LHCGR expression. As the follicle grows, 
the granulosa cells’ production of activin is decreased 
while their production of inhibin and follistatin (an 
activin-binding protein) is increased. In the rat ovarian 
granulosa cell culture system, adding activin to the culture 
media caused an abrupt increase in FSHR expression. 
However, activin production was sharply reduced 
after FSH stimulation of the cells. These results suggest 
that activin is secreted chiefly by granulosa cells before 
FSH stimulation and may play a role in maintaining 
the gonadotropin receptors25,26. On the other hand, in 
the theca cells, activin significantly reduced androgen 
synthesis that LH and IGF-1 stimulated. 
IGF-1 expression in the ovary is in growing and fully 
developed follicles and is localized  in the same region 
as FSHR and aromatase. Only the antral follicles with 
a diameter of 3-5 mm were found to express IGF-1 in 
human samples. On the other hand, from the primary

expression to promote follicular development and ovulation.

to the preovulatory stage, its receptor was present in 
most follicles. IGF-1 significantly increased LHCGR 
expression in the rat granulosa cell culture system after 
FSH stimulation. In this phenomenon, IGF-1 prolonged 
the half-life of the mRNA rather than improving the 
transcription of LHCGR mRNA. The addition of IGF-1 
also increased the expression of FSHR35. FSH increases 
the secretion of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) from rat granulosa 
cells36,37. In rat granulosa cell culture, when IL-6 was 
additionally provided, FSH-induced expression of 
LHCGR was dramatically increased. IL-6 is a cytokine 
that regulates humoral immunity and was initially 
discovered as a B-cell differentiation factor. 
4.  Expression of Gonadotropin 
Receptors in Non-Gonadal 
Cells
Recent research documenting the development of 
functional ectopic gonadotropin receptors, FSHR and 
LHCGR, which are thought to be important in non-
reproductive processes, has cast doubt on this long-held 
belief on their role in reproduction2. The expression of 
functional FSHR has been found on various non-gonadal 
tissues such as fat, bone, brain, adrenal glands, endothelial 
cells, uterus, placenta, umbilical cord, and several types 
of cancer tissues38. It was found in endometriotic lesions, 
where FSH induced the expression of CYP19A1 and 
the production of estrogen39. The extragonadal effects 
of FSH/FSHR activation get aggravated in menopausal 
women with high FSH and LH levels. The risks associated 
with the abnormal non-gonadal effects of FSHR include 
bone loss, obesity, cardiovascular risk, and cancer risk40. 
The modulation of bone mass and adipose tissue by 
FSH-induced signals was observed in genetically altered 
or antibody-treated mouse models41,42. Studies have 
shown a connection between FSH levels, osteoporosis, 
and postmenopausal increase in fat mass. In a study 
based on the Chinese population, low levels of FSH were 
linked to higher cardio-metabolic risk and cardiovascular 
disorders43. 
At menopause, women’s serum FSH levels dramatically 
increase. FSH receptors are expressed on osteoclasts, 
osteoclast precursors, and mesenchymal stem cells but 
not osteoblasts42,44,45. Sex hormone replacement therapy 
may be able to reverse obesity after menopause. As 
adipose tissues produce functional FSH receptors46, the 
benefits of sex hormone replacement might be mediated 
by a comparable decrease in serum FSH. Several studies 
have indicated FSHR expression in various tumor 
cells such as from the prostate, ovary, breast, thyroid, 
colon, neuroendocrine pancreas, urinary bladder, 
kidney, lung, liver, stomach, testis, and pituitary cancer, 
as well as soft tissue sarcomas47,48. FSHR expression 
is increased in tumour vessel cells by FSH47,48. FSHR 
expression was reported in endothelial cells in thyroid 
and neuroendocrine tumors49-51. Further, FSH promoted 
proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis in 
epithelial cancer cells47,48. 
4.1  LHCGR Expression in Non-Gonadal 
Cells
The extragonadal expression of LHCGR has been 
reported in the uterus, skin, kidney, placenta, glial 
cells, adipose tissue, pancreas, breast, adrenals, thyroid, 
neural retina, cone photoreceptors, and neuroendocrine

cells8. LHCGR expression was discovered in the mouse 
adrenal cortex52, supporting earlier research showing that 
postmenopausal women’s adrenal glands have LHCGR 
expression53. Cortisol synthesis and Cushing’s syndrome 
are related to abnormal LHCGR expression in the adrenal 
gland54,55. Human uterine tissues were also shown to 
express functional LH receptors2,56. LHCGR is expressed 
in the brain, in areas within the cortex related to cognitive 
functions, and in the hippocampus (Figure 4). Even 
in human brain microglial cells, immunoreactivity to 
LHCGR was discovered, and it was positively associated 
with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease57. 
LHCGR activation in brain is speculated to be linked to 
specific processes affecting behaviour. More recently, it 
was proposed that LHCGR expression is present in the 
retina, where LH and hCG would have similar effects on 
vascular endothelial growth factor58. 
4.2  LHCGR Expression in Cancer
Transgenic mice overexpressing human LHCGR (hLHR) 
had morphological and molecular changes (increased 
proliferation and trans-differentiation in the endometrial 
layer) in uterus. In these mice, there was upregulation of 
genes linked to cell cycle control and downregulation of 
genes connected to the immune system and xenobiotic 
metabolism. Older LHCGR transgenic mice developed 
uterine tumour masses that mimicked endometrial 
cancer59. LH promotes cell migration and invasion in 
breast cancer cells with functional LHCGR through 
modulation of multiple kinases, activating actin 
cytoskeletal proteins. LH causes paxillin phosphorylation 
and transport to the plasma membrane, where focal 
adhesion complexes are formed. This process is initiated 
through rapid extragonadal LHCGR signalling to Src/
FAK/paxillin resulting in the phosphorylation/activation 
of the nucleation promoter factors cortactin and N-WASP. 
As a result, there is an increase in cell motility and the 
invasive properties which promote the tumour cell 
metastatic dissemination60.
5. Conclusion
The discovery of FSHR and LHCGR has led to significant 
advancements in understanding gonadotropin action in 
gonadal and non-gonadal tissues; however, the significance 
of nongonadal receptors requires more investigation. 
The expression of FSHR and LHCGR is correlated with 
PCOS, cancer, and metabolic disorders. Much needs to 
be discovered about the cross-talk between FSHR and 
LHCGR due to changes in the FSH: LH ratio or their 
receptor levels. The therapeutic utilization of rhFSH and 
rhLH has much potential to improve the consequences of 
hormonal anomaly and infertility.
