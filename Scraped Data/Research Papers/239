The lack of the theory of the crystalline electric ﬁeld (CEF) in rare-earth based quasicrystal (QC)
and approximant crystal (AC) has prevented us from understanding the electronic states. Recent
success of the formulation of the CEF theory on the basis of the point charge model has made it
possible to analyze the CEF microscopically. Here, by applying this formulation to the QC Au-SM-
Dy (SM=Si, Ge, Al, and Ga) and AC, we theoretically analyze the CEF. In the Dy3+ ion with 4f 9
conﬁguration, the CEF Hamiltonian is diagonalized by the basis set for the total angular momentum
J = 15/2. The ratio of the valences of the screened ligand ions α = ZSM/ZAu plays an important
role in characterizing the CEF ground state. For 0 ≤ α < 0.30, the magnetic easy axis for the CEF
ground state is shown to be perpendicular to the mirror plane. On the other hand, for α > 0.30, the
magnetic easy axis is shown to be lying in the mirror plane and as α increases, the easy axis rotates
to the clockwise direction in the mirror plane at the Dy site and tends to approach the pseudo 5
fold axis. Possible relevance of these results to experiments is discussed.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The quasicrystal (QC) discovered by D. Shechtman in
1984 has no translation periodicity and thus may exhibit
an orientational rotational symmetry forbidden in peri-
odic crystal [1]. Clariﬁcation of the electric states and the
physical properties has been interesting and challenging
problem as the frontier of the condensed matter physics
because the Bloch theorem based on the periodicity can
no longer be applied. Recent discoveries of the quantum
critical phenomena in the QC Au51Al34Yb15 [2, 3] and
superconductivity Al14.9Mg44.1Zn41.0 [4] have attracted
great interest [5].
Since the discovery of the QC, it has been a long-
standing issue whether the magnetic long-range order is
realized in the QC. Experimental eﬀorts to ﬁnd it have
been devoted extensively [6]. There exists periodic crys-
tal with the local atomic conﬁguration common to that
in the QC, which is referred to the approximant crys-
tal (AC). In the rare-earth based 1/1 AC Cd6R (R=Pr,
Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Eu, Tm)[7–9] and 1/1 AC
Au-SM-R (SM=Si, Al, Ge, Sn; R=Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho)[10–
14], magnetic long-range orders have been observed [15].
Recently, ferromagnetic (FM) long-range order has been
discovered in the QC Au65Ga20R15 (R=Gd, Tb) [16].
These intriguing phenomena such as the magnetic
long-range orders and the quantum critical phenomena
take place in the rare-earth based QC and AC Au-SM-R
where the 4f electrons at the rare-earth atoms are respon-
sible for the appearance mechanism. The QCs and ACs
are composed of the Tsai-type cluster which consists of
multiple shell structures of atoms. In the 1/1 AC, the
Tsai-type cluster is located at the center and corner of
the body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice. As a typical ex-
ample of Au-SM-R, the Tsai-type cluster in the 1/1 AC
Au70Si17Tb13 [14] is shown in Fig. 1(a)-(e). The Tsai-
type cluster consists of (a) cluster center, (b) dodecahe-
dron, (c) icosahedron (IC), (d) icosidodecahedron, and
(e) defect rhombic triacontahedron. At the 12 vertices
of the IC in Fig. 1(c), the rare earth atom R (gray) is
occupied. The local conﬁguration of atoms around the
rare-earth atom R in the Tsai-type cluster is shown in
Fig. 2(a).
To understand the 4f electronic state in the rare-
earth compounds, it has been well known that the crys-
talline electric ﬁeld (CEF) is important in periodic crys-
tals [17, 18]. It is also expected to be true in the QC.
Thus far, experimental studies on the CEF were reported
in Tm- and Tb-based 1/1 ACs. By the speciﬁc-heat and
magnetization measurements in Zn85.5Sc11Tm3.5, the
CEF energy levels and the eigenstate were discussed [19].
By the inelastic neutron measurements in Cd6Tb [12] and
Au70Si17Tb13 [14], the CEF energy levels and the eigen-
states were analyzed. In ref. [14], the neutron data were
analyzed by the point charge model in detail taking into
account the eﬀect of the Au/Si mixed sites.
Theoretically, the lack of the theory of the CEF pre-
vented us from understanding the 4f-electron state in the
rare-earth based QC and AC. Recently, the theory of the
CEF in the rare-earth based QC and AC has been formu-
lated by the operator equivalence method on the basis of
the point charge model [20]. Then, the CEF in the QC
Au51Al34Yb15 and 1/1 AC has been analyzed theoreti-
cally taking into account the eﬀect of the Au/Al mixed
site [20].
Recent theoretical analysis of the CEF in the QC
Au-SM-Tb and AC has revealed that the CEF ground
state shows the unique magnetic anisotropy [21, 22].
The magnetic anisotropy plays a crucial role in realiz-
ing unique magnetic structure on the IC such as the
hedgehog, the whirling-moment state, and the ferrimag-
netic state [21, 22].
The theoretical calculation based
on the magnetic model taking into account the magnetic
anisotropy has been performed in the 1/1 AC and the
Cd5.7Yb-type QC. Then, it has succeeded in explaining
the magnetic structures of not only the measured FM or-

der of the ferrimagnetic state in the 1/1 AC Au70Si17Tb13
and AFM order of the whirling-antiwhirling states in the
1/1 AC Au72Al14Tb14, but also the FM order of ferri-
magnetic state in the QC, which oﬀers a candidate for
the measured FM order in the QC Au65Ga20Tb15 [21].
Very recently, the FM long-range order has been ob-
served in the QC Au-Ga-Dy [23]. Hence, it is important
to clarify the CEF in the QC Au-Ga-Dy. In this study,
by applying the formulation developed in ref. [20] to the
QC Au-SM-Dy, we analyze the CEF at the Dy site in the
Tsai-type cluster on the basis of the point charge model.
We reveal the magnetic easy axis in the CEF ground
state, which is indispensable for clarifying the magnetic
structure of the magnetically ordered phase observed in
the Dy-based QC as well as AC.
II.
ANALYSIS OF CEF IN QC AU-SM-DY AND
AC
A.
Lattice structure
Let us start with the lattice structure. Since the atomic
coordinate of the QC Au-Ga-Dy and the AC has not
been solved experimentally, we employ that in the 1/1
AC Au70Si17Tb13 [14] shown in Fig. 1 with Tb being
replaced with Dy. In Fig. 2(a), the vector from the center
of the IC passing through the Dy site is set to be the z
axis. Namely, the z axis is the pseudo 5 fold axis, as
clearly seen in the top view shown in Fig. 2(b). We set
the Dy site as the origin. Then, the y axis is set so as
the mirror plane to be the yz plane. Finally, the x axis
is set so as perpendicular to both the z and y axes.
In the ternary compounds of the QC Au-SM-Dy and
AC, there exists the Au/SM mixed site. Namely, non-
rare earth atom Au or SM atom exists at the speciﬁc site
with some existence probability. For example, in the 1/1
AC Au70Si17Tb13, the i = 1, 3, 4, and 16th sites are the
Au/Si mixed sites with Au/Si: 63%/37% for the i = 1, 3,
and 4th sites and Au/Si: 19%/81% for the i = 16th site
in Fig. 2(a) [14]. In the QC Au-Al-Yb and 1/1 AC, the
analysis of the CEF was performed by assuming that the
Au/Al mixed site is 100% occupied by Al and the result

was compared by the calculation taking into account the
eﬀect of the Au/Al mixed site [20]. The result shows that
the former approach describes at least qualitative feature
of the CEF. The same conclusion was also reported in the
QC Au-SM-Tb and AC [21, 22]. Hence, here we assume
that the Au/SM mixed sites are 100% occupied by SM
as a ﬁrst step of analysis.
B.
Point charge model for Dy3+ ion
The Dy3+ ion has 4f 9 electron conﬁguration. Since the
4f shell becomes closed shell with 4f 14 electron conﬁgu-
ration, the Dy3+ ion is regarded to have 4f 5 hole conﬁg-
uration. Then, the electrostatic interaction between the
4f 5 hole and surrounding ligand ions are expressed as the
CEF Hamiltonian
HCEF = 5|e|Vcry(r),
(1)
where the Coulomb potential is given by
Vcry(r) =
16
X
i=1
qi
|Ri − r|.
(2)
Here, Ri is the position vector of the Au or SM ions
labeled by i = 1 ∼ 16 surrounding the Dy3+ ion in
Fig. 2(a). The charge of the ligand ion qi is given by
3
qi = ZSM|e| for i = 1, 3, 4 and 16 and qi = ZAu|e| other-
wise, where ZSM and ZAu are the valences of the SM ion
and the Au ion, respectively. Since the existence prob-
ability of the cluster center shown in Fig. 1(a) is very
small [14], here we neglect it for simplicity.
By applying the Wigner-Eckart theorem [24] to HCEF,
we obtain [20]

For the expectation values of r2n by
the radial part, we employ the results of the Dirac-
Fock calculation for the Dy3+ ion ⟨r2⟩ = 0.2188 ˚A

⟨r4⟩ = 0.1180 ˚A

The

= −23/(33 · 5 · 7 · 11 · 13), and
γJ = 22/(33 · 7 · 112 · 132) [17, 18].

For the Dy3+ ion, the total angular momentum is
L = 5 and the total spin is S = 5/2. Since the 4f 9 con-
ﬁguration has more than half number of electrons in the
closed shell, the Hund’s rule tells us that the total angu-
lar momentum J = L+S = 15/2 gives the lowest energy
state. Then we calculate HCEF in Eq. (3) in terms of the
basis |J = 15/2, Jz⟩ for Jz = 15/2, 13/2, · · · , −15/2. By
diagonalizing the 16 × 16 matrix of HCEF, we obtain the
CEF energy En (n = 0, 1, 2, · · · , 7) and the eigenstate

where an,Jz is the coeﬃcient satisfying the normaliza-
tion condition P15/2
Jz=−15/2 |an,Jz|2 = 1. Here, ± denotes
the Kramers states.
Since the Dy3+ ion has the odd-
number of electrons (holes), the Kramers degeneracy ex-
ists, where the Kramers pair satisﬁes the orthogonality
condition ⟨ψn+|ψn−⟩ = 0.
The QC Au-SM-Dy and the AC are metallic crystals.
The nominal valences of the Au ion and for example Ga
ion are known to be +1 and +3 respectively [15, 26].
However, in reality, these values are considered to be re-
duced by the eﬀect of the screening of electrons. Hence,
we consider the valences of the screened ligand ions ZAu
and ZSM. In the present study, as a typical value, we set
ZAu = 0.223 which was identiﬁed by the inelastic neu-
tron measurement in the 1/1 AC Au70Si17Tb13 [14] and
analyze the CEF by changing the ratio α = ZSM/ZAu as
a parameter. It is noted here that if the value of ZAu is
changed, the CEF energy En is changed with En being
multiplied by a constant factor but the eigenstate does
not change as far as α is the same. This point will be
discussed again in §IV B.
III.
RESULTS
A.
CEF energy levels
The α dependence of the CEF energy En is shown in
Fig. 3(a). Energy levels are split into 8 levels where each
level has the Kramers degeneracy. Around α = 1, the
split width E7 − E0 is small, where the charge distribu-
tion around the Dy site is regarded as uniform one. In
Fig. 3(b), the enlargement for 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 is shown, where
the split width of the energy levels is smallest at α ≈ 0.8.
At α = 0.3035 ≡ αc indicated by the vertical dashed line,
the CEF ground energy E0 and the ﬁrst excited energy
E1 get close. Namely, the gap ∆ = E1± − E0± becomes
minimum ∆ = 22.6 K for α = 0.304. Figure 3(b) shows
that ∆ is typically larger than 10 ∼ 100 K. Hence, the
CEF ground state is expected to dominate over the lower
temperature region.
B.
Magnetic easy axis in the CEF ground state
To clarify the magnetic anisotropy arising from the
CEF, we calculate Mξν ≡ ⟨ψ0η| ˆJξ ˆJν|ψ0η⟩ (ξ, ν = x, y,
and z).
By diagonalizing 3 × 3 matrix M, we obtain
the normalized eigenvector J of the largest eigenvalue,

show J = (0, Jy, Jz), which indicates that the magnetic
easy axis is lying in the mirror (yz) plane. In Fig. 4(b),
we plot the α dependence of the angle θ deﬁned as the
angle between J and the pseudo 5 fold axis, i.e., z axis
[see inset in Fig. 4(b)]. In the bottom panel of Fig. 4(a),
for α >
∼ 0.30, Jz is slightly negative and becomes positive
as α increases. The negative Jz is not an artifact of the
calculation but reﬂects the fact that the magnetic easy
axis J points to the θ > 90◦ direction from the 5 fold axis.
At α = 0.31, the anisotropy angle is θ = 96.7◦ and at
α = 0.56 the easy axis J is perpendicular to the pseudo 5
fold axis, i.e., θ = 90◦. Namely, for 0.30 < α < 0.56, Jz in
the bottom panel of Fig. 4(a) is negative. As α increases,
J rotates to the clockwise direction in the mirror (yz)
plane and tends to approach the pseudo 5 fold axis.
Figures 6(a)-(d) illustrate the α dependence of the J
vector, i.e., the magnetic easy axis, in the local conﬁgu-
ration of atoms surrounding the Dy site. At α = 0.31,
the magnetic easy axis is directed to the nearly perpen-
dicular direction to the pseudo 5 fold axis in the mirror
plane, i.e., θ = 96.7◦, as shown in Fig. 6(a). At α = 0.8,
θ = 74.2◦ [see Fig. 6(b)] and hence for 0.31 ≤ α ≤ 0.8 [see
Fig. 3(b)], the magnetic easy axis remains nearly perpen-
dicular to the mirror plane. At α = 1.0, θ = 52.3◦ [see
Fig. 6(c)]. At α = 2.0, θ = 24.5◦ [see Fig. 6(d)].

DISCUSSION
A.
Comparison with Au-SM-Tb
The overall feature of the α dependence of the mag-
netic easy axis shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) is similar to
that obtained for the CEF analysis of the QC Au-SM-Tb
where the Au/SM mixed site was assumed to be 100% oc-
cupied by SM [21]. Although Tb3+ ion has 4f 8 electron
conﬁguration giving non-Kramers system and the ground
total angular momentum is J = 6, the CEF ground state
was shown to be doubly degenerate. The magnetic easy
axis is perpendicular to the mirror plane for small α and
is lying in the mirror plane for large α as similar to Fig. 5

J is the unit vector operator whose direction is
restricted to either parallel or antiparallel to the moment
direction shown in Fig. 4(b). Hence, the phase diagram
of the model (11) is also applied to the QC Au-SM-Dy
and the 1/1 AC. For FM interaction Jij, the magnetic
states on the IC, 1/1 AC, and Cd5.7Yb-type QC was
shown in ref. [21]. For antiferromagnetic interaction, Jij,
the magnetic states on the IC, 1/1 AC, and Cd5.7Yb-type
QC was shown in ref. [22]. Present study has revealed
that the minimal model for the QC Au-SM-Dy and the
AC is the model (11), which is also the model for the QC
Au-SM-Tb and the AC.
It is also noted that the magnetic anisotropy shown in
Fig. 5 has neither been observed experimentally in Au-
SM-Dy nor Au-SM-Tb to date. The magnetic structure
of the model (11) applied to the IC was discussed in sup-
plementary information in ref. [21]. The observation of
this state is left for interesting future experiments.
B.
Comparison with experiments
The results shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 indicate that the
ratio of the screened ligand ions α plays an important role
in characterizing the CEF ground state. Experimentally,
by performing the inelastic neutron measurement, the
valences of the screened ligand ions are expected to be
determined in the following way. First, by comparing the
ratio of each diﬀerence of the energy levels En+1 − En
for 0 ≤ n ≤ 6 with Fig. 3, the parameter α is identiﬁed.
Next, to reproduce the absolute value of each energy level
En, a constant factor is multiplied to each En. Then,
the valence of the screened Au ion ZAu is identiﬁed by
multiplying ZAu by the factor. In this way, ZSM as well
as ZAu can be determined experimentally.
V.
SUMMARY
The CEF of the 4f electrons at the Dy site inside the
Tsai-type cluster in the QC Au-SM-Dy and AC is ana-
lyzed theoretically on the basis of the point charge model.
The ratio of the valences of the screened ligand ions
α = ZSM/ZAu plays an important role in characterizing
the CEF ground state. For 0 ≤ α < 0.30, the magnetic
easy axis for the CEF ground state is perpendicular to
the mirror plane. On the other hand, for α > 0.30, the
magnetic easy axis is lying in the mirror plane and as α
increases, the easy axis rotates to the clockwise direction
in the mirror plane at the Dy site and tends to approach
the pseudo 5 fold axis. These overall features are similar
to those obtained in the CEF analysis in the QC Au-SM-
Tb and AC in ref. [21] and hence the magnetic model
(11) taking into account the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy
arising from the CEF introduced in refs. [21, 22] is con-
sidered to be also relevant to the QC Au-SM-Dy and AC.
Experimental identiﬁcation of α as well as ZAu is im-
portant for clariﬁcation of the uniaxial anisotropy of the
4f magnetic moment toward the understanding of the
magnetic structure of the FM long-range order in the QC
Au-Ga-Dy.
The experimental search for the magnetic
structure with uniaxial anisotropy perpendicular to the
mirror plane, which is predicted to exist in the present
study, is also interesting future subject.
