Abstract: Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and an important component of plant
metabolism. However, little is known about the effects of low P availability on P absorption, the
photosynthetic electron transport chain, and the antioxidant system in cotton. This study used
cotton genotypes (sensitive FJA and DLNTDH and tolerant BX014 and LuYuan343) with contrasting
low-P tolerance in a hydroponic experiment under 15 µM, 50 µM, and 500 µM P concentrations.
The results showed that low P availability reduced plant development and leaf area, shoot length,
and dry weight in FJA and DLNADH, compared to BX014 and LuYuan343. The low P availability
decreased the gas-exchange parameters such as the net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and
stomatal conductance, and increased the intercellular CO2 concentration. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence
demonstrated that the leaves’ absorption and trapped-energy ﬂux were largely steady. In contrast,
considerable gains in absorption and trapped-energy ﬂux per reaction center resulted from decreases
in the electron transport per reaction center under low-P conditions. In addition, low P availability
reduced the activities of antioxidant enzymes and increased the content of malondialdehyde in the
cotton genotypes, especially in FJA and DLNTDH. Moreover, low P availability reduced the activity
of PEPC and generated a decline in the content of ATP and NADPH. Our research can provide a
theoretical physiological basis for the growth and tolerance of cotton under low-P conditions.

1. Introduction
Phosphorus (P) is necessary for the plant metabolism of adenosine triphosphate (ATP),
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH), nucleic acids, and
phospholipids, because they all have signiﬁcant roles to play in plant growth, production,
signal transduction, and photosynthesis [1,2]. Therefore, the need for input of P in agri-
culture is projected to increase, due to the requirement for increased food production and
improved crop yields [3]. Estimates suggest that almost 30% of the world’s arable soils
lack P and need to be fertilized with this element to increase yields [4]. Because of the
limited availability of P in the soil and its limited transportation, plants are frequently
vulnerable to P nutritional stress in both natural and agricultural ecosystems [1]. Moreover,
P fertilizer has a much lower efﬁciency of usage. Typically, plants only absorb 10–25% of

the P fertilizer applied, whereas the residual P fertilizer leads to the deterioration of soil
ecology [5]. Understanding the physiological and metabolic mechanisms of plants under
different P availability to improve the utilization of P fertilizers is the key to solving the
above problems.
Photosynthesis is an essential process that generates energy to support plant growth.
Components participating in photosynthetic machinery, such as photosynthetic pigments,
photosystems, electron-transport systems, gas-exchange processes, and enzymes involved
in carbon metabolism, are important for photosynthetic efﬁciency [6,7]. Photosynthesis
commonly declines under P deﬁciency, since P is involved in several cellular processes,
including energy conservation, metabolic regulation, and signal transduction [8]. P deﬁ-
ciency can reduce the stomatal opening. With less stomatal opening, less CO2 is captured
and reduced to triose phosphate, signiﬁcantly reducing the recycling of ATP and NADPH,
thus inhibiting plants’ photosynthetic capacity and growth [9]. Under P deﬁciency, pho-
tosynthesis is generally reduced, due to feedback inhibition resulting from reduced leaf
growth. These decreases in photosynthetic activity might increase photosynthetic P-use
efﬁciency and may also decrease the leaf-mass-per-unit leaf area. [10]. Plant species, and
even genotypes of certain species, differ in their ability to maintain their photosynthetic
activity under P limitation. Signiﬁcant interspeciﬁc and intraspeciﬁc variation exists for
photosynthetic P-use efﬁciency under low P availability [11,12].
Photosynthetic pigments play a central role in absorbing light and transmitting en-
ergy [13]. A deﬁciency of P also decreases photosynthetic-pigment contents of the leaf,
such as carotenoids and chlorophyll (Chl) [14]. A previous study showed that P deﬁciency
decreases the activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in
diatom (Phaeodactylum tricornutum) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) [15,16]. Most studies
claim that a shortage of P results in a decrease in net CO2 assimilation, which, in most
instances, results in a decrease in stomatal conductance [17]. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy-
lase (PEPC) is not only a key enzyme of C4 photosynthesis; other PEPC isoforms are also
involved in a variety of metabolic processes in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic
tissues of all plants, e.g., replenishment of the tricarboxylic-acid-cycle intermediates, par-
ticipation in pH maintenance and regulation of guard-cell movement [18]. The low P
availability reduces photosynthetic capacity by affecting the activities of enzymes involved
in the Calvin cycle and ATP and NADP(H) [19,20]. This also results in a decreased use of
reduction, NADP(H), and decreased ferredoxin Fdred as a result of the decrease in Calvin-
cycle activity. A low P availability also limits the electron transport chain (ETC), which,
combined with an increase in the acidiﬁcation of lumen pH induced by the decrease in
ATP production, leads to the buildup of decreased electron carriers, such as plastoquinone.
They also play a negative role in controlling the expression of enzymes in the Calvin-cycle
enzyme and components of photosynthesis and ETC [21].
The chlorophyll-ﬂuorescence (ChlF) parameters can change, which reﬂects how light
energy is absorbed, used, transmitted, and dissipated by photosystem I (PSI) and photosys-
tem II (PSII) [22]. The multiple reduction stages of the electron transport chain are reﬂected
in the ChlF OJIP transient [23]. Previous studies have shown that the latent P deﬁciency
can be revealed by using ChlF, which causes a change in the OJIP transient to form around
the I-step [8]. Recently, a correlation was identiﬁed between the plant’s bioactive P pool
and the appearance of the I-phase OJIP transient [8].
Chloroplasts convert light energy to energy for chemical bonds. Light absorption by
the Chl molecules of PSI and PSII triggers a sequence of redox reactions along the thylakoid
membrane. These reactions result in the oxidation of water, reduction of NADP+ to NADPH,
and formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) can be interconverted by interaction with redox-active compounds of the chloroplast,
and ROS are produced both via O2-mediated primary ROS-generation mechanisms and
ROS-mediated interconversion reactions [24]. ROS are unfavorable for chloroplast func-
tions, because ROS cause oxidative damage by reacting with biomolecules [25]. Similar
to other abiotic stresses, P deﬁciency inevitably leads to an increase in the production
Antioxidants 2023, 12, 466

of ROS, a by-product of photosynthesis. Through the feedback-inhibition mechanism of
sugar accumulation, the utilization of the ETC is reduced [26]. Plants have developed
various defensive and remedial measures against this photooxidative stress, as well as
major modiﬁcations to chloroplast biochemistry, such as highly regulated enzyme and
non-enzyme mechanisms, including antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase
(SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT), to eliminate ROS and maintain the balance
between ROS production and elimination [27]. The activity of these antioxidant enzymes
will decrease under low-P-availability conditions [26,28]. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a
biomarker of lipid peroxidation found in plants or isolated chloroplasts, reﬂecting photoox-
idative damage to the lipids in the chloroplast membrane. It was found that the content of
MDA increased under low-P conditions [29].
Cotton is a vital crop for the global economy that produces natural ﬁber for the
textile industry. The agronomic properties of cotton are dramatically inﬂuenced by the
low P availability. Although research on photosynthesis has been conducted in various
plants [30], there have been few studies on the physiological mechanisms that affect the
ETC in cotton, challenged by low P availability. In this study, even a slight shortage
of P had a noticeable impact on photosynthetic electron transport. Low P availability
affected the I-phase in the ETC, based on a study of ChlF OJIP transients. It is possible
to use the change in ﬂuorescence-transient curvature to measure the bioactive amount
of P in plants. The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) To examine the effect of
low P availability on growth parameters, antioxidant-enzymatic activities, photosynthetic
parameters, Chl content, ChlF parameters, PEPC activity, and the contents of ATP and
NADP(H) among different low-P-tolerant genotypes. (2) To explore the correlation between
physiological indexes and PPUE under low P availability. The results of this study will
help to better understand the possible inﬂuence of the mechanism of low P availability
on cotton growth and development, photosynthesis, and antioxidant system, and provide
a theoretical and physiological basis for the growth and tolerance of cotton under low-P-
availability conditions.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials and Growth Conditions of Plants
Based on our unpublished data, four cotton genotypes were used, including BX014
and LuYuan343 (LP tolerant), FJA and DLNTDH (LP sensitive). Hydroponically cultured
plants were grown at the Cotton Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences, Anyang, China.
Healthy seeds were surface sterilized with ethanol (70% v/v) for 10 min and disin-
fected with 3% sodium hypochlorite (v/v) for 20 min. The seeds were then rinsed ﬁve times
with distilled water. Both cotton genotypes were incubated in a growth chamber in a com-
bination of sand and vermiculite (w/w). This study was conducted using nutrient-solution
hydroponics. The seedlings were transplanted into 8 L plastic boxes after germination. The
plants were grown under natural light in a greenhouse at 25/20 ◦C (day/night) tempera-
tures and 60% humidity. Each genotype was sown in seven replicates for each P treatment,
each plant as a repeat. The seedlings were treated with various nutrient supplies at the
two true-leaf stages. After transplantation, the seedlings were provided with 1/2-strength
Hoagland solution for one week, followed by full-strength Hoagland solution until the
end of the experiment. The plants were provided with 100 mL of dH2O daily, to replenish
the water lost by transpiration. Each plant’s location was changed randomly each week to
counteract the impact of the positioning [31].
The conventional nutrient solution was as follows: 0.1 mmol/L EDTA·Fe·Na, 1 mmol/L
MgSO4·7H2O, 2 µMol/L ZnSO4·7H2O, 46 µMol/L H3BO3, 4 µMol/L MnCl2·4H2O, 0.3 µmol/L
CuSO4·5H2O, 0.12 µMol/L (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 2.5 mmol/L Ca (NO3)2·4H2O, and com-
binations of three different P concentrations, including 15 µM and 50 µM (low P) and
500 µM (normal P), supplied as KH2PO4 in hydroponic culture. The nutrient solutions were
continuously aerated with an electric pump, the airflow rate was 2 L/min, and the pH was

maintained at 5.8 ± 0.5. The nutrient solutions were changed every seven days and aerated.
The whole test period was 28 days, and the plants showed obvious signs of P deficiency;
seven plants from each treatment were collected for further physiological measurements.
2.2. Measurement Traits and Methods
2.2.1. Measurements of the Leaf Area and Gas-Exchange Parameters
The gas exchanges were measured from 9:00 to 11:00, using an LI-6800 portable photo-
synthetic system (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with a CO2 control module and a
red–blue LED-light source. The photosynthetic-photon-ﬂux density of the leaf chamber
was set to 700 µMol m–2 s–1. The airﬂow rate in the leaf chamber was set as 700 µMol s–1.
The concentration of CO2 in the reference chamber was set at 400 µMol mol–1 for the
measurements. The net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration
rate (E), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), and CO2 concentration in the leaf chamber
(Ca) were simultaneously recorded from seven seedlings per treatment.
The leaf used to measure the gas-exchange parameters were collected, promptly
immersed in N2, and stored at −80 ◦C. The leaves were positioned with the main veins
cut out on A4 paper, and a 4 × 4 cm piece of green cardboard was added as a control.
Leaf images were obtained with a digital camera (7D, Canon, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), and
image software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA) was utilized to measure the
leaf area.
2.2.2. Chlorophyl-a-Fluorescence Measurements
The youngest fully developed leaves were used to collect ChlF transients using a
Handy PEA chlorophyll ﬂuorometer (Hansatech Instruments, King’s Lynn, UK). After
30 min of dark adaptation, the leaves were continuously illuminated with 3000 µMol
(photons) m−2 s−1 of red light to induce a fast ChlF curve. The ﬂuorescence transients were
recorded for 10 s, using a PIN photodiode. The graphic representations of the transients
were all double-normalized.
The OJIP ﬂuorescence-induction kinetics were recorded using a Handy Plant Efﬁciency
Analyser (PEA; Hansatech Instruments). All the measurements were conducted in triplicate.
The OJIP-curve red-light treatment was applied, to create 3000 µMol (photons) m−2 s−1
for 2 s. F0, FK, FJ, and FI represent the ﬂuorescence intensity at 20 µs, 300 µs, 2 ms, and
30 ms, respectively. We also used the fast-ﬂuorescence-curve OJIP to calculate the following:
Vt = (Ft − Fo)/(Fm − Fo) for O-P standardization, WOJ = (Ft − Fo)/(FJ − Fo) for O-J
standardization, and WOI = (Ft − Fo)/(FI − Fo) for O-I standardization. The descriptions
of the parameters and their calculation formulae are shown in Table S1.
2.2.3. Measurement of Malondialdehyde and Assays of Antioxidant Enzymes
The content of MDA was determined by the thiobarbituric-acid reaction [32]. After
the samples were weighed and ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen, a 0.5 g sample
of frozen leaves was used to determine the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Moreover,
10 mL of 50 mmol·L−1 sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) was added, which contained 1%
of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), 0.2 mmol·L−1 of EDTA, and 10 mmol·L−1 of magnesium
chloride, and was then centrifuged at 10,000× g for 15 min at 4 ◦C as previously described,
with modiﬁcations [33]. The activities of SOD (20220916), POD (20220929), CAT (20220902),
and the content of MDA (20220915) were detected spectrophotometrically using Solarbio
assay kits, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Solarbio, Beijing, China).
2.2.4. Determination of ATP, NADP(H), and the Activity of Phosphopyruvate Carboxylase
A total of 0.1 g of fresh samples was homogenized in TEA-EDTA-saturated phenol
(phenol-TEA; 0.6% triethylamine-phosphoric acid, pH 8.0 and 1 mmol L−1 EDTA, added to
saturation in the phenol). The homogenate was then assayed spectrophotometrically, using
the ATP (20220921) content assay kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. A total of 0.1 g of fresh leaves were homogenized with a pestle with 1 mL of
Antioxidants 2023, 12, 466
5 of 23
50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0). The homogenate was centrifuged at 8000× g for 15 min, at 4 ◦C.
The activity of PEPC (20220929) and the content of NADP(H) (20220915) were determined
with detection kits (Solarbio, Bejing, China), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2.2.5. Measurements of P Concentrations and Use of Efﬁciency Traits
After they had been ground to a ﬁne powder, dried samples of the leaves were
weighed to approximately 0.12 g each, after digestion with H2SO4-H2O2 at 360 ◦C for
3 h. The concentrations of P were measured using a Bran + Luebbe Continuous-Flow
AutoAnalyzer III (AA3; Bran + Luebbe GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany). The deﬁnitions of
P-use efﬁciency (PUE) for the cotton genotypes grown at various P concentrations were
also included, and calculated as previously described [34], with minor modiﬁcations:
P accumulation (PA) = the P concentration determined by multiplying the plant
dry weight;
P-uptake efﬁciency (PUtE) = the plant dry weight divided by P concentration;
P-use efﬁciency (PUE) = PA divided by dry weight;
Photosynthesis-P-use efﬁciency (PPUE) = the ratio of the maximum photosynthetic
rate per unit P.
2.2.6. Determination of the Contents of Chlorophyll and Carotenoids
The pigments were extracted from the leaves, and 0.5 g of the uppermost unfolded
leaf was weighed, cut into pieces, and placed in 15 mL of a mixture of acetone and ethanol
(v/v; 1:1). The leaf was kept at room temperature (25 ◦C) and incubated in the dark for 24 h.
A UV–Vis spectrophotometer (UV-1280; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used to determine
the absorbance at 663, 645, and 470 nm. In addition, Chl a and b were used to compute the
total Chl and the Chl a/b ratio [35], and the total carotenoid concentration was determined
as previously described [35].
2.2.7. Statistical Analysis
All the data were analyzed for normality (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) and tested for
homogeneity of variance using SPSS 24.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). A two-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data, and the means were separated using
a Tukey’s test at 5% level of signiﬁcance. The morphophysiological traits were used to
calculate the correlation of relationships in Microsoft Excel 2021 (Redmond, WA, USA). The
ﬁgures were drawn with GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). All the
data were expressed as the mean ± standard error (SE) of seven replicates; *, **, and ***
represent p ≤ 0.05, 0.01, 0.001, respectively, and ns stands for not signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Gas-Exchange Parameters among the Cotton Genotypes in Response to Differences in the
Availability of P
Different treatments of P dramatically impacted the parameters of leaf exchange of
gases (Figure 1). Our results showed that the values for Pn, Gs, and E decreased in parallel
with the level of P supplied (Figure 1). However, the extent of reduction differed among
the cotton genotypes, with the responses of FJA and DLNTDH slightly lower than those of
BX014 and LuYuan343 under conditions of low P (Figure 1). The Pn of BX014, LuYuan343,
FJA, and DLNTDH were reduced by 52.47%, 56.16%, 72.47%, and 71.26%, respectively,
under conditions of 15 µM P, and by 31.68%, 37.45%, 47.0% and 46.56%, respectively, under
conditions of 50 µM P, compared with those of 500 µM P (Figure 1A, Table S3). The trend in
the changes in E was similar to that in the Pn, and the effect of the low conditions of P was
reduced (Figure 1D, Table S3). With the increase in P concentration in cotton leaves, the
Ci/Ca ratio decreases, but there is no signiﬁcant difference among genotypes (Figure 1C).

respectively, but there was no difference among the different P treatments in FJA and 
DLNTDH (Figure 1D, Table S3). As expected, there was no discernible difference in gas-
exchange parameters between these genotypes under 500 µM P (Figure 1).

decreased by 19.56%, 2.18%, 10.47%, and 18.22% in conditions of 50 µM and 500 µM P,
respectively, but there was no difference among the different P treatments in FJA and
DLNTDH (Figure 1D, Table S3). As expected, there was no discernible difference in gas-
exchange parameters between these genotypes under 500 µM P (Figure 1).
3.2. Difference in the Growth Parameters among Cotton Genotypes in Response to Different
Availabilities of P
The P treatments differentially affected the development of cotton seedlings (Figure 2A).
With the decrease in P supply, the plant height and dry weight were drastically reduced.
However, the degree of reduction varied in different genotypes (Figure 2A).
Compared with 500 µM P, the shoot length of BX014 and LuYuan343 decreased by
29.41% and 28.31%, respectively, under 15 µM P, and by 17.18% and 14.07%, respectively,
under 50 µM P (Figure 2B, Table S2). The shoot length decreased by 40.71% and 44.71%,
respectively, under 15 µM P, and by 22.56% and 21.32%, respectively, under 50 µM P in
FJA and DLNTDH, compared with the 500 µM conditions of P (Figure 2B, Table S2). The
dry weight decreased by 50.59% and 47.90%, respectively, under15 µM P, and by 23.81%
and 22.16%, respectively, under 50 µM P in BX014 and LuYuan343, compared with 500 µM
P (Figure 2C, Table S2). The dry weight of FJA and DLNTDH decreased by 71.69% and
71.01%, respectively, in 15 µM conditions of P, and by 40.36% and 42.01%, respectively,
under 50 µM conditions of P, as compared with 500 µM conditions of P, (Figure 2C, Table S2).

In particular, the shoot length and dry weight of the LP-sensitive genotypes (FJA and
DLNTDH) decreased considerably more than those of the two LP-tolerant genotypes
(BX014 and LuYuan343) in both conditions of low P.
respectively, under 15 µM P, and by 22.56% and 21.32%, respectively, under 50 µM P in 
FJA and DLNTDH, compared with the 500 µM conditions of P (Figure 2B, Table S2). The 
dry weight decreased by 50.59% and 47.90%, respectively, under15 µM P, and by 23.81% 
and 22.16%, respectively, under 50 µM P in BX014 and LuYuan343, compared with 500 
µM P (Figure 2C, Table S2). The dry weight of FJA and DLNTDH decreased by 71.69% 
and 71.01%, respectively, in 15 µM conditions of P, and by 40.36% and 42.01%, 
respectively, under 50 µM conditions of P, as compared with 500 µM conditions of P, 
(Figure 2C, Table S2). In particular, the shoot length and dry weight of the LP-sensitive 
genotypes (FJA and DLNTDH) decreased considerably more than those of the two LP-
tolerant genotypes (BX014 and LuYuan343) in both conditions of low P.

3.3. Physiological Differences among Cotton Genotypes in Response to Different P Availability 
There were distinct differences in PA, PC, PUE, and PUtE leaf area, and in PPUE 
among the four genotypes, in response to P treatment (Figure 3). In comparison with the 
500 µM condition of P, all the genotypes that were treated with 15 µM and 50 µM P 
accumulated lower concentrations of P (Figures 3A and S1A). Overall, there was little 
genotypic variation regarding P concentration. The genotypes that were tolerant to low 
LP had significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher parameters than the LP-sensitive genotypes under 
the 15 µM and 50 µM conditions of P (Figure 2A,B). In contrast, in comparison with 500 
µM P, the PUE increased 5.24-, 5.57-, 2.31-, and 2.12-fold at 15 µM P, and 1.52-, 1.63-, 1.09- 
and 1.02- fold under 50 µM P, in BX014, LuYuan343, FJA, and DLNTDH, respectively

3.3. Physiological Differences among Cotton Genotypes in Response to Different P Availability
There were distinct differences in PA, PC, PUE, and PUtE leaf area, and in PPUE
among the four genotypes, in response to P treatment (Figure 3). In comparison with
the 500 µM condition of P, all the genotypes that were treated with 15 µM and 50 µM
P accumulated lower concentrations of P (Figures 3A and S1A). Overall, there was little
genotypic variation regarding P concentration. The genotypes that were tolerant to low LP
had signiﬁcantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher parameters than the LP-sensitive genotypes under the
15 µM and 50 µM conditions of P (Figure 2A,B). In contrast, in comparison with 500 µM P,
the PUE increased 5.24-, 5.57-, 2.31-, and 2.12-fold at 15 µM P, and 1.52-, 1.63-, 1.09- and

Both the 15 and 50 µM conditions of P reduced the leaf area of all the cot
genotypes (Figure S1B, Table S2). Compared with FJA, DLNTDH, BX014, and LuYuan3
the leaf areas were reduced less under the 15 µM and 50 µM conditions of P (Figure S
Table S2). As shown in Figure 2E, the leaf area decreased by 34.52%, 34.59%, 47.64%, 
46.62% under the 15 µM conditions of P and by 20.30%, 19.54%, 29.51%, and 29.76% un

compared with the conditions of 500 µM P (Figure S1B, Table S1). In contrast, the val

4.70-fold, respectively, under the 15 µM conditions of P, and 1.37-, 1.23-, 1.23- and 1
fold, respectively, under the 50 µM conditions of P, compared with those under conditi

3.4. Contents of Chlorophyll Pigments among Cotton Genotypes in Response to Different
Availabilities of P
Both the 15 and 50 µM conditions of P reduced the leaf area of all the cotton genotypes
(Figure S1B, Table S2). Compared with FJA, DLNTDH, BX014, and LuYuan343, the leaf
areas were reduced less under the 15 µM and 50 µM conditions of P (Figure S1B, Table S2).
As shown in Figure 2, the leaf area decreased by 34.52%, 34.59%, 47.64%, and 46.62% under
the 15 µM conditions of P and by 20.30%, 19.54%, 29.51%, and 29.76% under the 50 µM
conditions of P in BX014, LuYuan343, FJA, and DLNTDH, respectively, compared with the
conditions of 500 µM P (Figure S1B, Table S1). In contrast, the values for the PPUE of BX014,
LuYuan343, FJA, and DLNTDH increased 6.91-, 6.18-, 4.96-, and 4.70-fold, respectively,
under the 15 µM conditions of P, and 1.37-, 1.23-, 1.23- and 1.24-fold, respectively, under
the 50 µM conditions of P, compared with those under conditions of 500 µM P (Figure 3D,
Table S2). However, there was no variation in the PPUE among these genotypes when the
conditions were 50 µM and 500 µM P.
The contents of Chl a in BX014, LuYuan343, FJA, and DLNTDH decreased by 50.99%,
49.63%, 29.73%, and 27.11%, respectively, under conditions of 15 µM, and by 29.62%,
32.61%, 6.76%, and 11.11%, respectively, under conditions of 50 µM P, compared with
those of 500 µM P (Figure S2A, Table S3). The contents of Chl b in these genotypes under
conditions of 15 µM and 50 µM P also decreased, compared with the conditions of 500 µM P.
Notably, the contents of Chl a and b among these genotypes did not differ under conditions
of 500 µM P (Figure S2A,B).

Simultaneously, a reduction in Chl, carotenoids, and Chl /carotenoid in all the geno-
types was observed under 15 µM and 50 µM P, compared with those at 500 µM. However,
the ratio of Chl a/b among these genotypes did not differ from each other under all the P
treatments (Figure S2C–F). Notably, the contents of pigments indicators, except for Chl a/b
in the two LP-tolerant genotypes BX014 and LuYuan343, were greater than those of the two
LP-sensitive genotypes FJA and DLNTDH by a substantial margin, under low conditions
of 15 µM and 50 µM P (Figure S2).
3.5. Genotypic Variation in Antioxidant Activities and the Content of MDA in Response to
Different Availabilities of P
In our study, low conditions of P reduced the activities of CAT, POD, and SOD in
the cotton leaves (Figure 4). The activity of SOD, BX014, LuYuan343, FJA, and DLNTDH
decreased by 51.56%, 52.38%, 24.91%, and 24.36%, respectively, under conditions of 15 µM

P, compared with those of 500µM P (Figure 4A, Table S4). The activity of POD in the
different P treatments showed a similar trend, which was a decrease, with a reduction in
the concentration of P (Figure 4B). In comparison with the conditions of 500 µM P, the
activity of CAT decreased remarkably, by 27.29%, 23.24%, 48.24%, and 39.08% in BX014,
LuYuan343, FJA, and DLNTDH, respectively, under conditions of 15 µM P, but there was
no variation or difference among these genotypes under conditions of 50 µM P (Figure 4C,

3.7. The Fluorescence-Increase-Kinetics OJIP Curves among Cotton Genotypes in Response to
Different Availabilities of P
The ratio of NADPH/NADP+ in BX014, LuYuan343, FJA, and DLNTDH increased
by 31.75%, 34.07%, 44.28%, and 62.21%, respectively, under conditions of 15 µM P, and by
15.98%, 21.44%, 13.06%, and 18.62%, respectively, under conditions of 50 M P, compared
with those of 500 µM P (Figure 5C). Compared with conditions of 500 µM P, the activity of
PEPC decreased dramatically, by 36.58%, 35.72%, 54.22%, and 51.69%, and 19.30%, 19.98%,
32.72%, and 28.45% with respect to BX014, LuYuan343, FJA, and DLNTDH, respectively,
under conditions of l5 µM and 50 µM P, respectively. (Figure 5D, Table S4).
To more clearly observe how P treatments affect transient dynamics, the curves have
been represented on the graph based on the relative variable ﬂuorescence, Vt = (Ft − Fo)/
(FM − Fo) (Figure 6). All the genotypes in this study showed a different typical polyphasic
rise in the OJIP-transient curve under conditions of 15 µM and 50 µM P (Figure 6). A
recognizable increase in the O-J-I phase in the OJIP-transient curve was observed in FJA
and DLNTDH under conditions of 15 µM and 50 µM P, but as the concentration of P
increased, this increase was observed to decline (Figure 6C,D). The application of 15 µM and
Antioxidants 2023, 12, 466

genotypes sensitive to LP was higher than those tolerant to LP (Figure 6).

Calculating the relative variable ﬂuctuations in the ﬂuorescence curve enabled re-
searchers to determine changes in the increase in OJIP-ﬂuorescence kinetics. They were
created by deducting the values of normalized ﬂuorescence (between O and P) in all the
genotypes (∆V = Vt [15 µM and 50 µM P] − Vt [500 µM P]) (Figure 6). Positive ∆Vt values
indicated lower rates of electron transportation, i.e., with negative values. The electron
transport efﬁciency (ETE) decreased. At conditions of 15 µM P, a positive ∆K (at 0.3 ms),
∆J (at 2 ms), and negative ∆I (at 30 ms) were established, and then turned into positive
∆P peaks on BX014 and LuYuan343 at 100 ms (Figure 6E,F). The curves under conditions
of 50 µM P in these genotypes changed in a manner similar to those under conditions of
15 µM P, but the amplitude was less than those in the 15 µM conditions of P (Figure 6E,F).
At the 15 µM P conditions of FJA and DLNTDH, a positive ∆K was created at 0.15 ms
and a ∆J peak at 2 ms; the value then turned to produce a negative ∆I peak at 30 ms,
and the value was also negative in ∆P (Figure 6G,H). There was a similar trend in the
conditions of genotypes sensitive to LP at 50 µM P, but the amplitude was less than that
at conditions of 15 µM P (Figure 6G,H). These ﬁndings demonstrated a disruption in the
photosynthetic-electron-transport cycle under low-P conditions in which the LP-tolerant
genotypes could retard this damage, in contrast to the LP-sensitive genotypes.
3.8. The O-J-I-P Phase among Cotton Genotypes in Response to Different Availabilities of P
Additional normalizations and associated subtractions were made to assess the events
captured by the OK, OJ, OI, and IP phases (difference kinetics). In addition, the ﬂuorescence-
increase-kinetics curves are shown (Figure S3). The ﬂuorescence-increase-kinetics data of
different P treatments were double-normalized by O (20 µs) and K-step (300 µs) to show
the L-band as WOK and ∆WOK, as described in Table S1. The unit groupings of PSII or
the energetic connectedness between the antenna and PSII RCs are known to be indicated
by the L-band. It was observed most clearly that at the 50 µM conditions of P the L-band
increased, and the conditions of 15 µM and 500 µM P slightly increased the L-band of all
the genotypes (Figure S3B). It was clear that the WL and ∆WL values of FJA and DLNTDH
increased under the 15 µM and 50 µM conditions of P, but those of BX014 and LuYuan343
did not increase, compared with the 500 µM conditions of P (Figure S3B). This suggested
that low-P conditions caused an increase in the L-band, owing to the increase in the J-step
(Figure S3B).
The increases in the ChlF kinetics were standardized to ensure that the effects of varied
P treatments on the K-step were as expected by the O-step (20 µs) and J-step (2 ms), and
are shown in Figure S3C. WOJ and ∆WOJ are described in Table S1. The curves of ∆WOJ
indicated that low conditions of P induced the occurrence of the K-band, particularly for
FJA and DLNTDH (Figure S3C). Only the conditions of 15 and 50 µM P increased the
value of WK (Figure S3A), which corroborated the fact that low conditions of P can indeed
damage some of the operating OEC facilities.
In addition, the ﬂuorescence-kinetics curves between the O-step and I-step (30 ms)
were standardized, and WOI and ∆WOI are also described in Table S1, as well as WOI ≥ 1,
which was plotted in the linear 30–270 ms time range, to show the IP phase (Figure S3D).
∆WOI was altered to show the effects of different P treatments on the J-step, and the results
were similar to those of ∆Vt (Figure S3D). The 15 µM and 50 µM conditions of P decreased
the amplitude of WOI curves to various P treatments (Figure S3D). Another ﬂuorescence-
increase-kinetics normalization, WIP, (normalized by the I- and P-step) is presented in
Figure S3E.
The time point at WIP = 0.5 (half-time of the increased curves) can be used to reﬂect
the rate of reduction of PSI and the pool of electron acceptors. It is clear that the half-rise
time values of 15 µM P (approximately 90 ms) and 50 µM P (approximately 70 ms) of
BX014 and LuYuan343 were greater than those of FJA and DLTDH at the same treatments
of P (Figure S3E). This suggests that low-P conditions lower the end-electron-acceptor
reduction rates of PSI, and the LP-sensitive genotypes gave higher results than the LP-
tolerant genotypes.

parameters that deﬁne PSII functioning are depicted in the spider plot, and show how all
the cotton genotypes responded to low conditions of P, compared with those at 500 µM P
(Figure 7). The nutritional stress of plants can be evaluated using Fv/Fm, which reﬂects
the maximal quantum yield of the primary photochemistry of PSII. The Fv/Fm of each
genotype decreased dramatically under 15 µM and 50 µM P, compared with those at
500 µM P, but values for the LP-tolerant genotypes were higher than those of the LP-
sensitive genotypes at conditions of 15 µM and 50 µM P (Figure 7, Table S5).

3.10. Relationship between PPUE and Morphophysiological Variables
To better understand the relationship between the morphological and physiological
parameters of cotton seedlings and the key parameters of the ETC under low availabilities
of P, we analyzed the correlation between parameters in this study (Figure 8). Our results
showed that the cotton genotypes positively correlated in the PUE and PPUE (Figure 8).
In addition, the antioxidant substances had a strong positive correlation with the growth
parameter of cotton seedlings and a negative correlation with PUE and PUtE. There was a
negative correlation between Pn with PUE, PUtE, and PPUE, in all genotypes (Figure 8).
It is worth noting that there is a positive correlation between antioxidant-enzyme activity
and gas-exchange parameters with dry weight. There is also a positive correlation be-
tween photosynthetic pigment and dry matter. Pearson’s correlation analysis revealed that
antioxidant-enzyme activity, photosynthetic pigment, and Pn were signiﬁcantly high and
positively correlated.

Our results show that P availability is a main factor that limits cotton growth, which is
consistent with other studies [1]. In this study, the availability of low P affected the physio-
logical and biochemical parameters of four cotton genotypes, and this change is described
in (Figure 9). Previous studies have shown that a shortage of P prevents photosynthe-
sis [8]. However, little is known about the effects of low P availability on P absorption,

mechanisms responsible for low P availability. Processes that appear to be down-regulated are

size and font size represent the activities of the organelle components. 
4.1. Effects of the Low Availability of P on the Enzymes Related to the Photosynthesis System 
Photosynthesis commonly declines under P deficiency, since P is involved in several 
cellular processes, including energy conservation, metabolic regulation, and signal 
transduction [8]. In this study, Pn, Gs, and E decreased under low P conditions. 
Nevertheless, an increase in Ci in this result demonstrates a clear dawn inhibition of 
photosynthesis, due to the lack of P carriers, strongly evidencing that the stomatal 
limitation is not imposing any barrier to the entry of CO2. Previous studies have shown 
that the reduction in the stomatal conductance limits the diffusion of CO2 necessary for 
carboxylation reactions, thus reducing Pn [36].  
A P shortage has previously been demonstrated to immediately affect the ETC, 
because of its crucial roles [8]. Based on our results, low P inhibited the contents of ATP 
and NADP(H) in cotton leaves. A previous study also found that low P reduces the 
contents of ATP and NADP(H) in barley [8]. Low P stress reduces the ETC protein 
complex, including PSII, Cytb6f, and PSI [37]. As a response, a deficiency in P limited

4.1. Effects of the Low Availability of P on the Enzymes Related to the Photosynthesis System
Photosynthesis commonly declines under P deﬁciency, since P is involved in several
cellular processes, including energy conservation, metabolic regulation, and signal trans-
duction [8]. In this study, Pn, Gs, and E decreased under low P conditions. Nevertheless,
an increase in Ci in this result demonstrates a clear dawn inhibition of photosynthesis, due
to the lack of P carriers, strongly evidencing that the stomatal limitation is not imposing
any barrier to the entry of CO2. Previous studies have shown that the reduction in the
stomatal conductance limits the diffusion of CO2 necessary for carboxylation reactions,
thus reducing Pn [36].
A P shortage has previously been demonstrated to immediately affect the ETC, because
of its crucial roles [8]. Based on our results, low P inhibited the contents of ATP and
NADP(H) in cotton leaves. A previous study also found that low P reduces the contents of
ATP and NADP(H) in barley [8]. Low P stress reduces the ETC protein complex, including
PSII, Cytb6f, and PSI [37]. As a response, a deﬁciency in P limited photosynthesis by
decreasing the efﬁciency of ETC and that of ATP, NADP(H), and biosynthesis [38]. These
studies demonstrated that ATP-synthase activity was controlled in response to metabolic
or physiological circumstances, which enabled control over assimilatory responses [39].
The levels of NADP+ serve as a substrate for the synthesis of NADP(H). In this study,
their levels were also dramatically reduced by a shortage of P, which demonstrates that a
larger proportion of NADP+ is still in the reduced form, NADP (H), owing to its inability
to be used in the Calvin cycle because of ATP limitations and greater PSI activity [38].
The C3-type PEPC exists in all plants, and participates in many physiological functions,
such as the supply of intermediates in the tricarboxylic-acid cycle, the synthesis of OAA,
and the subsequent synthesis of malic acid and its derivatives [40]. Relevant research on
Antioxidants 2023, 12, 466

cotton found that PEPC enzyme activity is conducive to the synthesis, transportation, and
decomposition of photosynthetic products, promoting ﬁber development and improving
yield [41,42]. The activity of PEPC in this study was signiﬁcantly (p ≤ 0.05) reduced by a
deﬁciency of P. The growth of -P plants has been reported to be enhanced by overexpressing
PEPC in rice and citrate synthase in cotton [43]. Our results demonstrate that the decrease
in PEPC activity under low-P conditions could be one of the important limiting conditions
for reducing the photosynthetic rate.
Severe P deﬁciency or toxicity can alter the photosynthetic apparatus and photo-
systems, thus causing photo-oxidative stress [38]. As is well-known, the early stages of
photosynthetic reactions are strongly related to ChlF. Changes in the fundamental responses
that alter PSII are effectively represented by the ChlF parameter, which serves as an ef-
fective index when the plant is under stress [44]. A potent non-invasive technique for
tracking changes in photochemical efﬁciency and photosynthetic electron transport is the
measurement of ChlF transients [45]. Depletion of the I-step from the fast OJIP portion of
the ChlF transient can be used to identify a shortage of P [46]. The reaction can be used
to precisely forecast the bioavailable P in both monocots and dicots, since it is so sensitive
to the P content in leaf tissue [47]. Our study of cotton genotypes showed a difference
in typical OJIP-transient and ChlF measurements among different availability conditions
of P. It is possible that the higher Fo, rather than the decreased ﬂuorescence, caused the
decreased IP phase in P-deﬁcient leaves from t = 30 ms to t = 300 ms (I step to P step). This
showed that the plastocyanin had degraded, and the electrons were transferred from the
FeS clusters to ferredoxin. Similar ﬁndings were also observed under a P deﬁcit in barley
and pomelo [48]. An impeded electron ﬂow from the OEC to the secondary electron donor
of PSII can be used to explain the positive K-band, and a decrease in the turnover of QA
subsequently slowed [49]. Our results showed that at approximately 0.15 ms, a positive
L-band was visible, indicating that in P-deﬁcient leaves, the PSII units were less clustered
or that the movement of energy between independent PSII units was hampered. A similar
result has also been previously described [48].
Our ﬁndings showed that cotton genotypes under low-P stress had lower Fv/Fm
values than those under normal P condition. As a result, the P shortage impacted the
PSII-response centers. A previous study showed that, owing to the feedback inhibition of
photosynthesis, a severe P deﬁcit reduces the Fv/Fmand results in Chl loss [23]. Our results
showed that, despite the higher photon-energy-capture RC and CSo under conditions of P
deﬁciency, as shown by the increase in ABS/RC, DIo/RC, and TRo/RC, a lack of P reduced
the efﬁciency of electron transport from the donor side of PSII to the ﬁnal acceptor side of
PSI. This was revealed by a decrease in ψEo, ϕEo, and ϕRo, which led to reduced CO2
assimilation in cotton genotypes deﬁcient in P. Similarly, in wheat leaves, reduced energy
trapping and electron transport per excited cross section were observed with increasing
salt concentrations, indicating a decreased energy-absorption efﬁciency of PSII [50]. Some
previous studies showed impaired electron transport from the donor side of PSII to the
ﬁnal acceptor side of PSI when P is lacking [8].
4.2. Effects of the Low Availability of P on the Enzymes Related to the Antioxidant System
Photosynthesis involves the conversion of sunlight energy into stored chemical energy,
which is realized through the electronic transmission of a series of oxidation–reduction
reactions. Due to the risk of molecular-oxygen reduction, excessive photosynthetic elec-
tron transport may be dangerous, resulting in excessive accumulation of ROS [51]. To
avoid excessive ROS generation, it is necessary to coordinate the electron-transfer rate
with the capacity of the electron acceptor in the chloroplast matrix. The imbalance be-
tween the donor and the receptor sides of PSI can lead to inactivation, which is called
PSI photoinhibition. Therefore, the instantaneous or continuous generation of ROS may
occur. The photosynthetic membrane protein complexes (PS II, the b6/f complex, and PS
I) can produce ROS under speciﬁc conditions. Possible sources of ROS in PS II and PS I
are the Chl-containing, light-harvesting arrays in both photosystems. ROS can oxidatively
Antioxidants 2023, 12, 466
18 of 23
damage proteins, pigments, lipids, and nucleic acids [52]. A previous study showed that
low P levels could also induce ROS production by compromising the use of light energy
harvested by reaction centers and synthesizing ATP and NADPH [53], which results in
electron-transport-chain overload [44].
Previous studies have shown that a deﬁciency or excess of macronutrients can cause
the overproduction of ROS in plants and rapidly trigger the oxidative defense reaction [54].
When the stress reaches a certain intensity, the balance between ROS and the antioxidant
system is broken. Antioxidant substances are widely found in aerobic or oxygen-resistant
organisms. They have been proven to catalyze the reaction of superoxide anions to reduce
or eliminate excessive ROS produced during metabolic processes [38]. In this study, the
conditions of 15 µM and 50 µM P substantially reduced the activities of SOD, POD, and
CAT. Previous research has shown that the activity of ROS-scavenging enzymes increases
in response to low-P stress, to shield chloroplasts from the photooxidative damage induced
by low P and to maintain redox homeostasis [44]. Some studies found that the enzyme
activities of SOD, POD and CAT would decrease under a low-P environment, which is
consistent with our results [26,28].
The MDA is the production of lipid peroxide inside cells. Its content could reﬂect
the degrees of the lipid peroxide of the organism, and be enhanced under P-deﬁciency
stress [55]. A previous study showed that a P shortage could result in increased contents
of MDA in the stems of lentils (Lens culinaris Medik.) [56]. Our results showed that low P
availability increased the MDA content of leaves, which indicated that low P availability
aggravated the lipid peroxidation of plant membranes. However, the MDA content of
low-P-tolerant genotypes was lower than that of low-P-sensitive genotypes. Therefore,
the amount of MDA may be a response indicator of the physiological mechanism of the
low-P-tolerant genotypes to adapt to low P availability.
4.3. Low Availability of P Affects Growth Parameters, Phosphorus Utilization, and PPUE
Photosynthesis is fundamental for plant growth and total-biomass production. Ma-
nipulating photosynthetic performance can optimize growth and biomass. Therefore, the
photosynthesis condition is considered the major factor inﬂuencing yield in modern agri-
cultural production [57]. Plant photosynthetic capacity depends on the net photosynthetic
rate and photosynthetic area of the plant [58]. Chl content, especially Chl b content, and
stomatal conductance are key factors that greatly affect the Pn [59]. A previous study
showed that P deﬁciency caused stunted growth and resulted in early leaf senescence, with
severely decreased leaf area and photosynthesis [60].
In this study, cotton seedlings cultured under P-deﬁcient conditions were dwarfed,
with low pigment content. The reason may be that both ROS generated by P deﬁciency
promote Chl degradation and limit photosynthesis and cotton growth. Our studies have
demonstrated a signiﬁcant positive correlation between P efﬁciency and photosynthetic-
related traits in cotton genotypes, particularly under low-P conditions. We have also
observed that leaves differed greatly in morphology under low-P conditions, with leaves
grown under P deﬁciency showing a smaller leaf area compared with those treated with
normal P; this is consistent with other research [61], and this result suggests that P deﬁciency
may decrease photosynthesis and ultimately affect plant growth and biomass. These
ﬁndings were also observed in other studies [62]. In this study, the dry weight decreased
under low-P-availability conditions. The lower dry weight may be caused by the decrease
in Chl content, which is consistent with previous studies [63]. In addition, there was a
signiﬁcant correlation between Chl a content and dry weight of cotton leaves and the
relevant ﬂuorescence parameters (Figure 8). This suggests that ChlF parameters are to
some extent a response to the growth status of the plant.
An increasing amount of research shows that achieving relatively fast rates of pho-
tosynthesis with high PPUE requires a delicate balance in investment among foliar-P
fractions [64]. For instance, some plants suffering from P deﬁciency can decrease their
overall requirement for foliar P by reducing investment in non-metabolite-P fractions to
Antioxidants 2023, 12, 466
19 of 23
different degrees, thus buffering the direct P restriction of photosynthesis [11]. Plant species,
and even genotypes of certain species, differ in their ability to maintain their photosynthetic
activity under P limitation. Signiﬁcant interspeciﬁc and intraspeciﬁc variation exists for
PPUE under low-P stress [11]. However, our understanding of the biochemical basis for
differences in PPUE among and within species is still in its infancy. This study showed
that the cotton seedling PPUE under low-P conditions was higher than that under normal
treatment, and the cotton genotypes with low-P tolerance showed higher PPUE under
low-P conditions. We also found a signiﬁcant negative correlation between PPUE and P
content in leaves. This increases the PPUE under low-P conditions.
In our study, the concentrations of leaf P in the different cotton genotypes were im-
pacted differently by low P. Previous studies have demonstrated that, compared with
the low-P-sensitive cotton genotypes, the low-P-tolerant cotton varieties improved the P
absorption and root P accumulation, establishing a stable percentage of stem P accumula-
tion, the total biomass of leaves and seedlings, seed cotton yield and ﬁber length [65,66].
However, in another study, it was found that the low-P-tolerant variety showed higher ﬁber
strength, ﬁber ﬁneness, ﬁber uniformity, and ﬁber elongation, although it was found that
different P concentrations had no direct impact on ﬁber quality [67]. Several reports have
shown that, compared with the low-P sensitive cultivar, the low-P-tolerant cultivar had high
cotton-seed weight, cotton-seed yield, and dry biomass, and accumulated more P [68–71].
Other studies have shown that low-phosphorus conditions will also have a greater impact
on the content of large amounts, and of the micronutrients in cottonseed [72].
5. Conclusions
Low P availability reduced leaf area, shoot length, and dry weight, particularly in
low-P-sensitive genotypes. Similarly, low P decreased pigment content and net photosyn-
thetic rate, and P-use efﬁciency of cotton genotypes, especially low-P-sensitive genotypes.
The activity of the PSII, ATP, and NADP(H) content decreased under low-P conditions.
Moreover, the analysis of ChlF parameters showed that low P availability impairs the
electron transport from the donor side of the PSII to the receptor side of the PSI terminal,
which has a greater impact on the performance of the PSII donor side than the PSII and
the PSI receptor side. Low P availability increased the content of malondialdehyde in
leaves but decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, especially in low-
sensitive genotypes. Based on these results, we concluded that low P availability affects
nutrient absorption, reduces photosynthetic performance, and leads to ROS production.
Different low-P-tolerant cotton genotypes showed differences in their adaptability to low P
availability. This may be the key reason for the difference in low-P tolerance among these
cotton genotypes. Moreover, this research conﬁrms that under stress conditions, the fall in
the I-step of the induction curve for the early diagnosis of P deﬁcit in cotton is a unique
physiological bioindicator. Our ﬁndings may help to better understand the theoretical basis
of the effect of low P availability on the photosynthesis and antioxidant system in cotton.
