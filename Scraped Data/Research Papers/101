Abstract
Background: Breast cancer is the commonest global malignancy and the primary cause of carcinoma death. MCM6 is vital to carcino-
genesis, but the pathogenesis of MCM6 remains unclear. Methods: MCM6 expression in patients with breast cancer was examined
through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, immunohistochemistry, Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT‒PCR) and Western
blotting. The prognostic factors were assessed by the Kaplan‒Meier method and Cox regression. On the basis of the key factors se-
lected by multivariable Cox regression analysis, a nomogram risk prediction model was adopted for clinical risk assessment. The TCGA
database was utilized to determine how MCM6 is correlated with chemotherapy sensitivity, immune checkpoint-related genes (ICGs),
tumor-infiltrating immune cells, along with tumor mutation burden (TMB) and methylation. The impact of MCM6 on carcinoma cells
was investigated in terms of proliferation, cell cycle as well as migrating and invasive behavior through CCK assays, flow cytometry,
wound healing assays, Transwell assays and xenotransplantation experiments. Results: MCM6 expression was upregulated, which is
closely associated with the size of the tumor (p = 0.001) and lymph node metastasis (p = 0.012) in patients with breast cancer. Multivari-
ate analysis revealed MCM6 to be an independent risk factor for prognosis in patients with breast carcinoma. The nomograph prediction
model included MCM6, age, ER, M and N stage, which displayed good discrimination with a C index of 0.817 and good calibration.
Overexpression of MCM6 correlated with chemotherapy sensitivity, immune checkpoint-related genes (ICGs), tumor-infiltrating im-
mune cells, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and methylation. Silencing MCM6 significantly inhibited proliferation, prolonged the G1
phase of the cell cycle, and restrained the proliferation, migration and invasive behavior of cancerous cells in vitro and inhibited tumor
growth in vivo. Conclusions: Our research shows that MCM6 is highly expressed in breast cancer and can be used as an independent
prognostic factor, which is expected to become a new target for the treatment of breast cancer in the future.

1. Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common global malignancy
and the primary cause of carcinoma death, severely damag-
ing the health of the female population [1]. Breast cancer
is a kind of disease with high heterogeneity in morphology,
molecular biology, clinical manifestations and therapeutic
response that leads to prevention and treatment remaining
challenging worldwide [2–4]. In recent years, many genes
related to the progression of breast cancer have been dis-
covered according to its pathogenesis and drug resistance
mechanism. Traditional chemotherapy combined with tar-
geted therapy and immunotherapy achieved better effects
than before. For instance, trastuzumab, a monoclonal anti-
body utilized as a standard treatment for malignancy in the
case of Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)
overexpression in cancer cells, has an objective response
rate of 26% in clinical treatment [5]. The combined med-
ication of cetuximab and cisplatin could inhibit Epidermal
Growth Factor Receptor(EGFR) and prolong progression-
free survival by 1.5 to 3.7 months and overall survival (OS)
time extended from 9.4 to 12.9 months [6]. Targeted ther-
apy is of vital importance for the overall prevention and
treatment of malignancy. However, continued treatment
results in a loss of target expression, and gene mutations
downstream of the target gene itself lead to acquired re-
sistance [7–9], which are the greatest challenge facing tar-
geted therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have
entered the treatment regimen for metastatic breast cancer.
Biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression and tumor infiltrat-
ing lymphocytes (TIL) are commonly used for immunother-
apy, yet only a subset of patients benefit from ICIs and
immune-based combination therapy [10]. Immunotherapy
alone has been shown to increase the risk for early death
compared with other treatments. Immunotherapy combined
strategy can prevent early death [11]. Based on the com-
bination of ICIs with each other or with other anticancer
drugs, including systemic chemotherapy and poly ADP-
ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, targeted therapy has
become a widely used strategy and new direction in cancer
immunotherapy [12]. Identification of biomarkers predict-
ing response to immune combinations is the key to progress
[13]. Therefore, the discovery of novel diagnostic and ther-
apeutic biomarkers could be a breakthrough in the treatment
of the disease.
MCM6 is a key regulator of DNA replication and
hence plays an undeniable role in maintaining the cell cy-
cle [14]. MCM6 expression is upregulated in many cancer-
ous cells, and the overexpression of MCM6 promotes the
occurrence and development of carcinoma [15–18]. Rele-
vant studies proved that MCM6 regulates proliferation, im-
mune response and maintenance of the DNA replication
system and tumor cell proliferation and invasion and other
physiological and pathological processes [19,20]. MCM6
promotes metastasis though the MEK/ERK pathway and
serves as a novel serum biomarker for early relapse in hep-
atocellular carcinoma [21]. MCM6 is highly expressed in
tumors with higher histological grades, especially in clin-
ically aggressive breast cancers (e.g., luminal B, HER2-
positive, and triple-negative subtypes) [16].
Therefore,
MCM6 might represent a sensitive and specific biomarker
for cancer prognosis. Inhibition of MCM6 is likely to be an
effective treatment. Nevertheless, the function and related
mechanism are unclear in breast carcinoma.
This study aimed to explore the correlation between
the expression level of MCM6 and clinicopathological fea-
tures and to evaluate whether MCM6 can be used as a prog-
nostic factor for breast cancer. Then, the related signaling
pathways and chemotherapy sensitivity with MCM6 over-
expression in patients with breast cancer were evaluated
via gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and Genomics of
Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. Additionally,
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was employed
to determine the correlation between MCM6 and tumor-
infiltrating immunocytes. The functional role of MCM6
was further investigated in vitro and in vivo in breast cancer
cells. This study provides an important basis for further ex-
ploring the role of MCM6 in diseased cells and for targeted
treatment of breast carcinoma.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Cell Culture and Clinical Specimenss
The human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, BT549,
T47-D, MDA-MB-231, and HCC-1806 and the human
breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A were obtained from The
Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences and ATCC and
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and cultured
at 37 °C with 5% CO2. MCF-7 and T47D are estrogen
receptor positive human breast cancer cell lines, BT549,
MDA-MB-231 and HCC-1806 human triple negative breast
cancer cell lines. All experiments were performed using
mycoplasma-free cells. All cell lines were authenticated
using single nucleotide polymorphisms profiling. One hun-
dred cases of paraffin-embedded diseased tissues and corre-
sponding paired normal tissues were obtained from hospi-
talized patients with breast carcinoma at the First Affiliated
Hospital of Kunming Medical University from September
2014 to July 2021. All paraffin tissue samples were kept by
our hospital and were used for immunohistochemical stain-
ing, and there was no need to consult the patient. This study
was approved by the relevant authoritative organization of
the hospital.
2.2 Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT‒PCR) and Western
Blotting
TRIzol reagent (15596-026, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) was utilized for the extraction of the aggre-
gate RNA, which was reverse transcribed to cDNA ac-
cording to the requirements of the RevertAid First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (K1622, Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA). PCR amplification was conducted using the
SYBR Green Select Master Mix System (4472908, In-
vitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) on a CFX96TM Real-
Time PCR Detection System.
The target mRNA ex-
pression was normalized to the mRNA expression of
GAPDH. The primers were as such follows:
MCM6:
forward, 5′-TGTCAGTGGTGTTGATGGATATG-3′, re-
verse 5′-GCTGTCTGTTCCTCATCTCTG-3′;
GAPDH:
forward, 5′-GGCAACAATATCAGCAACTTC-3′, reverse
5′-GGTCCTTAGGTGTGGTATC‑3′. All qRT‒PCR exper-
iments were conducted no less than three times. MCM6
expression was examined via Western blotting.
Briefly,
the cells were lysed for 20 min using RIPA buffer (89900,
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and all
cell proteins were extracted after centrifugation. The BCA
Protein Assay Kit (23227, Pierce, Waltham, MA, USA)
was adopted for the quantification of cell lysate protein.
The protein solution was separated using SDS–PAGE and
transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane,
which was treated with evaporated milk (5%) at 4 °C for a
night. The PVDF membrane was cultured with anti-MCM6
antibody (13347-2-AP, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA) at
1:1000 at approximately 23 °C and treated with secondary
antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution. The internal control used
was β-actin (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China, #TA-09).
2.3 Immunohistochemical (IHC) Staining
IHC staining was performed in conformity with the
manufacturer’s protocol (Dako REAL EnVision Detection
System; Dako, Santa Clara, CA, USA). To elaborate, the
tissue segments underwent a baking process at 68 °C for 2
h. The slices were dewaxed with xylene, gradient alcohol
and distilled water. Then, the slices were boiled in citric
acid buffer (pH 6.0, 0.01 M) for 2 min at high temperature
and pressure for antigen repair. The slices were incubated
with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous perox-
idase activity. Subsequently, the slices were cultured with
MCM6 antibody (diluted 1:400; 13347-2-AP, Proteintech)
at 4 °C overnight and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody.

Consortium.
Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) was used to
observe the reaction. IHC staining was scored by two inde-
pendent investigators. The aggregate score was obtained by
multiplying the proportion of positive tumor cells [scored
as 0 (<5%), 1 (6~25%), 2 (26~50%), 3 (51%~75%), 4
(76~100%), respectively] and the staining intensity (scored
as 0, 1, 2, and 3 according to severity). Based on the final
scores, less than 5% of cells were stained, regardless of in-
tensity, and specimens were categorized as negative; weak,
moderate and strong were given marks of 1~4 points, 5~8
points and 9~12 points, respectively. For the following sta-
tistical analysis, the negative and weak groups were taken
as the low MCM6 expression group, and the moderate and
strong groups were considered to be the high MCM6 ex-
pression group.
2.4 Data from the TCGA Cohort and ULCAN Platform
The RNA-seq data and relevant information about
the research subjects were acquired from the 2022 ver-
sion of The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA)
(https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/
Cancer-Genome-Atlas) from the official website.
The
subjects were grouped into two groups according to
expression level, namely, the median MCM6 mRNA

expression of each sample. The clinicopathological data
of the subjects were collected, including age, clinical
classification of primary focus, regional lymph node
and distant metastasis, represented by TNM collectively,
endogenous molecular classification (Luminal A, Luminal
B, basal like, HER2 overexpression or normal type) and
histological type. The expression level of MCM6 protein in
breast cancer patients was obtained in UALCAN database
(http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/).
2.5 Prognostic Analysis and Construction of a Predictive
Nomogram
The online websites Kaplan‒Meier Plotter (http://km
plot.com/analysis/) and PrognoScan (http://dna00.bio.kyut
ech.ac.jp/PrognoScan/) were selected for the prognostic
analysis of MCM6 in patients with breast carcinoma. The
“rms” R package was used to combine MCM6 expression
with clinicopathological features to construct a nomogram
risk prediction model for the prediction of OS, and the pre-
dictive performance was measured using calibration curves
and the C-index [22,23].
2.6 Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
The h.all.v7.5.symbols.gmt [Hallmarks] gene set
database was selected. GSEA was deployed to elaborate
the functional differences of the gene between the two ex-
pression groups, and the MCM6 expression level was con-
sidered a label of phenotype. The arrangements of gene
sets were arranged out by 1000 times per every analysis.
The False Discovery Rate (FDR) q value, the normalized
enrichment score (NES) and the nominal p value were es-
tablished to classify each phenotypic enrichment signaling
pathway.
2.7 Correlation Analysis between MCM6 Expression and
Immune Checkpoint-Related Genes in Breast Cancer
With the RNA-seq data, the MCM6-ICG relations to
explore the immune genes related to MCM6 expression
were analyzed using the R package, which includes limma,
reshape2, ggplot2, ggpubr, and corrplot. The correlation
threshold was set to a correlation coefficient ≥0.2 and a p
value less than 0.05.

2.8 Cell Proliferation Assay
Diseased cell proliferation was measured with a sul-
forhodamine B (SRB) assay.
The cells were seeded in
a 96-well plate (100 µL/well) and fixed with cold 10%
trichloroacetic acid for half an hour at room temperature.
The SRB solution (0.4%, Sigma S9012, Wappingers Falls,
NY, USA) was treated with deionized water and then added
for dyeing for approximately 10 min. Tris solution (10 mM)
was incubated at 23 °C for 5 min, and the optical density
(OD) of the cells was determined at 490–530 nm wave-
lengths [24].
2.9 Cell Cycle Assay
The cell samples were collected using trypsin, fixed
with 80% ethanol at 4 °C in a dark environment overnight,
and then stained in the dark with propidium iodide (0.1
mg/mL, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lake, NJ, USA) and
RNase A (1 mg/mL) for 30 minutes. The cell cycle of each
group was tested via flow cytometry. The data were ana-
lyzed by FlowJo 7.6 (San Carlos, CA, USA) [25].
2.10 Cell Apoptosis Assay
The collected cells were resuspended in binding
buffer, cultured with Annexin V-FITC (BD Biosciences) for
10 minutes in a dark environment at room temperature and
subsequently stained with binding buffer and PI (BD Bio-
sciences) in darkness for 30 minutes at 4 °C. Cell measure-
ment was conducted using flow cytometry [25].
2.11 Wound Healing Assay
The cells were inoculated into 6-well culture plates in
complete medium until they were 80% confluence. The
cells were scratched with a 200 µL pipette tip. Then the
medium was changed to a serum-free medium. The mi-
gration process was carefully observed at 0, 24 and 48 h
on an inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Im-
ageJ (National institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA)
was employed to calculate the migration area [25].
2.12 Transwell Assay
The cell suspension was cultured in serum-free
medium into the upper layer of the experimental plates
coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences).
The serum-
containing medium was placed in the lower layer. The cells
that invaded the lower layer received methanol treatment
and Giemsa staining and were photographed microscopi-
cally [26].
2.13 Animal Experimental Procedures
The animal experiments won approval from the au-
thoritative organization of the hospital. Six-week-old fe-
male BALB/C nude mice were maintained in a pathogen-
free environment. MDA-MB-231 cells (1 × 106/point),
which were divided into two groups (Normal control group,
shMCM6 group), were injected subcutaneously into the

size was observed every 4 days. The tumor size was mea-
sured using a caliper, and the formula was as follows: vol-
ume = 1/2 (width2 × length). The mice were sacrificed after
24 days. The diseased tissues were excised and weighed.
The tumors were collected and used for additional IHC
pathological analysis [25].
2.14 Statistical Analysis
For data analysis, SPSS 22.0 software (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA) was adopted.
The expression dif-
ference between breast tumor and normal breast tissues
was analyzed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Univari-
ate and multivariate Cox analyses were selected to analyze
the influence of MCM6 expression along with other factors
on mouse survival. Logistic regression analysis was per-
formed to determine how MCM6 was related to other clin-
ical factors. One-way analysis of variance was employed
to make comparisons between two groups. p < 0.05 was
deemed to be statistically significant.

prognostic role of MCM6 in breast carcinoma, and (A), (B), and (C) represent Overall Survival (OS), Relapse Free Survival (RFS) and
Distant Metastasis Free Survival (DMFS), respectively. The Kaplan Meier Plotter online website was also utilized for the analysis of the
prognostic effects of MCM6 in breast cancer, and the results suggested reduced survival time in patients with overexpression of MCM6
in terms of all three indicators mentioned above, and (D), (E), and (F) represent OS, RFS and DMFS, respectively.
3. Results
3.1 MCM6 Expression was Significantly Increased in
Breast Cancer
We first explored MCM6 expression in a wide range
of human malignancies. The mRNA expression of MCM6
increased in various cancers from TCGA database analysis
(Fig. 1A,B), and MCM6 expression in breast cancer con-
siderably exceeded that in normal tissues (Fig. 1C,D). The
protein expression level of MCM6 in patients with breast
cancer outstripped that in normal tissues from the online
database UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/) (Fig. 1E).
Consistent with the expression pattern from the online
database, immunohistochemical staining outcomes indi-
cated higher MCM6 expression in diseased tissues than in
adjacent breast tissue. Among 100 cases of breast cancer
tissues, 92 cases (92.0%) had overexpression of MCM6,
and the rest (8.0%) had low expression of MCM6, while
there were 45 cases (45.0%) with overexpression of MCM6
and 55 cases (55.0%) with low expression of MCM6 in ad-
jacent tissues (Fig. 2A–C). In comparison with MCF-10A
human breast epithelial cells, MCM6 expression in breast
cancer cell lines (MCF-7, BT549, T470, MDA-MB-231,
HCC1806) was significantly increased (Fig. 2D,E). These
results suggest that MCM6 was overexpressed in patients
with breast carcinoma.
3.2 MCM6 is a Poor Prognostic Factor in Breast Cancer
We further explored how MCM6 expression is cor-
related with clinicopathologic parameters (age, histologi-
cal grade, size of tumor, lymph node metastasis, vascular
invasion, distant metastasis, and molecular typing). The
outcomes demonstrated that MCM6 expression was asso-
ciated with the size of tumor (p = 0.001) and lymph node
metastases (p = 0.012) (Table 1). An analysis of the TCGA
database revealed that the expression of MCM6 varied ac-
cording to age, and there were differences between Asians
and Caucasians White (Fig. 3A,B); MCM6 expression in
estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR)-
negative breast cancer patients was higher than that in ER-
and PR-positive breast cancer patients (Fig. 3C,D); MCM6
expression in HER2-positive subjects was more obvious
than in negative breast cancer patients (Fig. 3E); MCM6
expression was elevated in luminal B, basal and HER2
breast cancer (Fig. 3F); MCM6 expression in invasive lob-
ular carcinoma was higher than that in invasive lobular
carcinoma tube carcinoma (Fig. 3G); no notable differ-
ence in the expression of MCM6 was found in each clini-
cal stage (Fig. 3H); MCM6 expression was different only
in the T1 and T2 stages; no considerable difference was
shown in MCM6 expression between the N stage and the
M stage, which T represents tumor size stage, N repre-
sents lymph node metastasis stage, and M represents distant

metastasis stage (Fig. 3I–K). Based on the analysis from
the PrognoScan online website, breast cancer patients with
high MCM6 expression had reduced OS, relapse-free sur-
vival (RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS)
(Fig. 4A–C), which is consistent with the results of the
Kaplan-Meier Plot online prognostic analysis (Fig. 4D–F).
In addition, univariate Cox regression analysis re-
vealed that the expression of ER, PR, stage, T stage, M
stage, N stage and MCM6 was associated with a low sur-
vival rate of patients (Fig. 5A). In multivariate Cox regres-
sion, after adjusting for other confounding factors, the ex-
pression of age, ER, M, N and MCM6 was an independent
indicator (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, various indicators (age,
ER, M, N and MCM6 expression) were included in the
nomogram prediction model by multivariate Cox regres-
sion. The total score was obtained by age, expression of
ER, M stage, N stage, MCM6, and prediction of survival
probabilities at three years and five years (Fig. 5C). The
C-index for the prediction nomogram was 0.817. Calibra-
tion curves displayed the predictive power of the predic-

tive model in terms of survival time in patients with breast
carcinoma (Fig. 5D,E). These results suggest that overex-
pression of MCM6 is a dismal prognostic factor for breast
cancer.
3.3 Enrichment and Functional Analysis of Gene Sets
GSEA was performed between subgroups with dif-
ferent levels of MCM6 expression using the whole gene
network based on the TCGA dataset with a view to ex-
plore the biological pathways via which MCM6 works
in diseased tissues.
The biological processes involved
mainly included DNA repair, different pathways of IL6-
JAK-STAT3, MTORC1, PI3K-AKT-MTOR, MYC, etc.
(Fig. 6A). KEGG analysis demonstrated that overexpres-
sion of MCM6 was mainly involved in the process of mis-
match repair, the regulation of ubiquitination proteolysis,
ERBB signaling pathway and p53 signaling pathway. In
addition, MCM6 is enriched in immune signaling pathways
and activates related immune responses, such as B cell and
T cell receptor pathways, and cytotoxic effects of natural
killer cells (Fig. 6B).
3.4 Evaluated MCM6 Expression and Sensitivity to
Chemotherapy Drugs
The impact of MCM6 expression on chemosensitiv-
ity in patients with breast carcinoma were assessed via
the pRRophetic algorithm and the half-maximal inhibitory
concentration available in the Genomics of Drug Sensi-
tivity in Cancer (GDSC) database.
The results demon-
strated that 134 chemotherapeutic drugs were identified to
be significantly correlated with MCM6 expression. In the
group overexpressing MCM6, we found that there were 14
chemotherapy drugs with significant effects (Fig. 7A–N),
especially PD-0332991 (p = 3.7 × 10−12) and trametinib (p
< 2.22 × 10−16). According to these findings, the drug sen-
sitivity of these small molecule compounds is better when
MCM6 is highly expressed, but further exploration and ex-
perimental verification are needed.
3.5 Correlation Analysis of MCM6 and ICGs, Immunity,
TMB and Methylation
The expression correlation between MCM6 and genes
related to immune detection points was analyzed based on
the TCGA BRCA database. Our research outcomes indi-
cated a positive correlation between MCM6 and the ex-
pression of multiple immune checkpoints and a negative
correlation with that of BTNL9 (Fig. 8A). Analysis of the
relationship between MCM6 and immunity, including 24
kinds of immune cells, showed a significantly negative cor-
relation with eight immune cells (iDC, CD8 T cell, Th17
cells, eosinophils, mast cells, NK CD56 bright cells, NK
cells, pDC) but a significantly positive correlation with fif-
teen immune cells (cells of Th2, aDC, Th1, Treg, T helper,
NK CD56dim, Marcophages, B, Tcm, DC, Tgd, T, Term,
Neutrophils, TFH) (Fig. 8B). In addition, MCM6 expres-
sion was positively correlated with TMB (R = 0.33, p < 2.2
× 10−16) (Fig. 8C). Finally, we also analyzed the methyla-
tion levels of MCM6 in the diseased group and the normal
group, and the outcomes revealed that MCM6 had a higher
methylation level in breast cancer (Fig. 8D).
3.6 MCM6 Knockdown Inhibited the Proliferation of
Breast Cancer Cells
To make a clarification of the biological role of MCM6
in the progression and prognosis of breast carcinoma,
the lentivirus system was used to conduct stable MCM6

knockdown in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cancerous cells
(shMCM6), by which the mRNA and protein expression
of MCM6 was considerably down-regulated (Fig. 9A,B).
MCM6 down-regulation prevents the growth of cancerous
cells (Fig. 9C), lead to a higher percentage of apoptotic cells
(Fig. 9D). MCM6 silencing caused cancerous cells to re-
produce in large numbers in G1 phase and reduced cancer-
ous cells in S phase (Fig. 9E). MCM6 knockdown also re-
duced the migrating and invasive power of diseased cells
(Fig. 9F,G). To test whether MCM6 promoted breast tumor
growth in vivo, a subcutaneous transplantation tumor model
of BALB/c nude mice was constructed with MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells (Fig. 10A). The volume and weight of the
xenografts of MDA-MB-231 cells with MCM6 knockdown
were lighter than those of the control group (Fig. 10B,C).
The quantity of ki-67-positive cells in the xenograft tu-
mor with MCM6 knockdown was decreased compared with
that in the control group, consistent with MCM6 expression
(Fig. 10D). These results suggested that MCM6 knockdown
can successfully retrain the growth of cancerous cells both
in vivo and in vitro.

tion, with increasing incidence and a trend toward younger
age year by year [2].

drug; PARP inhibitors iniparib, veliparib and olaparib for
BRCA1/2 mutation, etc., has significantly prolonged life
expectancy and quality of life in patients [26–28]. Although
the mentioned drugs have achieved good clinical efficacy,
they are only targeted at patients with specific molecular
changes. There are still many breast cancer patients with
poor efficacy because of drug resistance and other prob-
lems. Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous tumor, and its
occurrence and development involve many gene changes.
Hence, it is imminent to explore new biological markers
and potential targets of breast cancer to provide a new basis
for prognostic effect management and the development of
targeted medication.
This research suggested that MCM6 expression was
increased in a variety of tumors, including breast cancer,
combined with TCGA database, clinical samples and breast
cancer cells. Our conclusions are supported by Issac et al.
[16]. Furthermore, MCM6 expression in luminal B, basal
13
and HER2 breast cancer was significantly increased, and
that in invasive lobular carcinoma was higher than that in
invasive ductal carcinoma, which indicated that the role and
prognostic value of MCM6 in different types of breast can-
cer may be different and that the mechanism needs to be
further investigated.
In recent years, studies on biomarkers, prognostic
markers and prognostic models of breast cancer have at-
tracted increasing attention and can provide a good basis
for the prognosis of breast cancer. We constructed a nomo-
gram prediction model that included five factors (age, ex-
pression of ER, M stage, N stage and expression of MCM6)
by multivariate Cox regression analysis, and the research
results showed that low expression of MCM6 may indicate
longer survival time for patients with breast cancer in our
prognostic model. Relevant studies reported that excessive
expression of MCM6 was related to poor prognostic effect.
High expression of MCM6 mRNA was significantly associ-
ated with shorter survival time of patients with breast can-
cer [29]. Low expression of MCM6 mRNA is associated
with increased recurrence-free survival in breast cancer pa-
tients [16]. The expression level of MCM6 in high-grade
tumors is significantly increased and correlated with mitotic
count, which is an effective reference index for tumor grad-
ing [30]. These results agreed closely with the outcomes in
the model we constructed and suggested that overexpres-
sion was independent as a prognostic factor for breast car-
cinoma.
An increasing number of studies have shown that
the role of MCM6 in tumor progression is extensive [14].
MCM6 silencing leads to arrest of S to G1 phase pro-
gression by reducing CDK2, CDK2, cyclin A, cyclin B4,
cyclin D1 and cyclin E in hepatocellular carcinoma [31].
MCM6 promotes the metastasis of hepatocellular carci-
noma through the MEK/ERK pathway [21]. CDK5RAP3
reduces MCM6 nuclear translocation, thereby reducing
gastric cancer proliferation [32].
Liu et al.
[33] found
that SIX1 is an oncoprotein in cervical cancer that pro-
motes proliferation by promoting the expression of MCM6.
Boulay et al. [34] found that ARF1 promotes breast can-
cer proliferation by enhancing the expression of MCM6 and
up-regulating the activity of pRB/E2F1. Nevertheless, the
function of MCM6 in breast carcinoma remains unclear.
The results of this study showed that MCM6 promoted
breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and pro-
moted breast cancer migration and invasion in vitro. How-
ever, the biological pathway by which MCM6 plays a role
in breast cancer remains unknown. By using GSEA, the
study clarified the fact that overexpression of MCM6 pro-
motes tumor progression mainly through the JAK-STAT3,
mTOR myc, PI3K-AKT ERBB and p53 signaling path-
ways, which are closely related to tumorigenesis. Liu et al.
[21] reported that MCM6 activates the MEK-ERK signal-
ing pathway to promote the metastasis of liver cancer. We
found that MCM6 overexpression is also related to the reg-
ulation of ubiquitination proteolysis, and whether MCM6 is
involved in these signaling pathways has not been reported.
Notably, MCM6 is involved in mismatch repair, which is
consistent with the findings of Sherman et al. [35] reported
that MCM6 was an important regulatory factor in the DNA
replication system through complex formation with other
MCM6 proteins to regulate DNA replication of the cell cy-
cle in the carcinogenic process. In addition, our results in-
dicated that the increased MCM6 expression had a bear-
ing on cytotoxic effects of B-cell and T-cell receptor path-
ways and natural killer cells. Recent studies have shown
that MCM6 functions to obstruct immune progression by
reducing the immune response in microglial cells [14].
Therefore, MCM6 may be the key mediator of the immune
response. We analyzed the relationship between MCM6
expression and immune checkpoint-related genes and im-
mune cells. The results demonstrated that MCM6 displayed
positive relevance with many immune checkpoint-related
genes and negative correlation with BTNL9 in breast can-
cer, which has not been reported before and is worthy of
further exploration. Whether MCM6 can affect the func-
tion of these immune checkpoints in breast cancer needs
further study.
Given that MCM6 is key to the progression of breast
carcinoma, we further explored the correlation between
MCM6 and breast cancer-related chemotherapy drugs for
therapy. Two potential drugs, PD-0332991 and trametinib,
which are more sensitive when MCM6 is highly expressed,
were screened out from breast cancer-related chemotherapy
drugs. PD-0332991 is an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6
with oral activity and has antiproliferative activity on cancer
cells, inducing their cell cycle arrest [36]. In addition, PD-
0332991 guided the apoptosis of diffuse large B-cell lym-
phoma cells in a dose-dependent manner [37]. Studies have
shown that PD-0332991 can be used for hormone (ER/PR)-
positive and HER2-negative breast cancer [38]. Trametinib
is an effective reversibility inhibitor of MEK 1/2 that re-
strains cell proliferation by blocking the MAPK pathway
[39]. The FDA has approved trametinib combined with
dabrafenib for patients with metastatic melanoma who have
the BRAF V600E/K mutation [40]. Our results indicated
that keener sensitivity to PD-0332991 and trametinib can
be found in patients with overexpression of MCM6, which
can be used as a monitoring indicator of drug sensitivity in
breast cancer. However, our screening results still need to
be verified by a large number of clinical cases and related
experiments.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, our research shows that overexpression
of MCM6 can be found in patients with breast carcinoma
and used as a poor prognostic factor for the disease. MCM6
can promote the proliferation of cancerous cells in vitro and
in vivo. Based on database and bioinformatics analyses,
MCM6 plays a crucial role in tumor immunity, tumor mu-

tation burden and methylation through a variety of biolog-
ical pathways and is related to drug sensitivity (Fig. 11).
MCM6 can be used as a poor prognostic marker of breast
cancer and a potential target for immunotherapy and tar-
geted therapy. However, in our experiments, we have not
further verified the biological pathways of MCM6 in breast
cancer and the role and mechanism of MCM6 in tumor mu-
tation burden and tumor immunity, and further studies are
needed. In the future, comprehensive individualized treat-
ment with chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy
and immunotherapy will become the main treatment option
for breast cancer patients. Our preliminary study showed
that the high expression of MCM6 in breast cancer increases
the sensitivity of related drugs. Targeting MCM6 and com-
bining with related sensitive drugs is a promising research
direction. Therefore, our study demonstrates that MCM6
has a potential oncogenic role in breast cancer and provides
a new direction for targeted therapy and immunotherapy in
breast cancer patients.
