Abstract: Excess weight and obesity are the ﬁfth leading cause of death globally, and sustained
efforts from health professionals and researchers are required to mitigate this pandemic-scale prob-
lem. Polyphenols and ﬂavonoids found in Aspalathus linearis—a plant widely consumed as Rooibos
tea—are increasingly being investigated for their positive effects on various health issues including
inﬂammation. The aim of our study was to examine the effect of Rooibos extract on obesity and the
associated low-grade chronic inﬂammatory state by testing antioxidant activity, cytokine secretions,
macrophage polarization and the differentiation of human adipocytes through the development of
adipospheroids. Rooibos extract signiﬁcantly decreased ROS production and the secretion of pro-
inﬂammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-2 and IL-17a) in human leukocytes. Additionally, Rooibos
extract down-regulated LPS-induced macrophage M1 polarization, shown by a signiﬁcant decrease in
the expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines: TNFα, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β and CXCL10. In addition, Rooi-
bos inhibited intracellular lipid accumulation and reduced adipogenesis by decreasing the expression
of PPARγ, Ap2 and HSL in adipospheroids. A signiﬁcant decrease in leptin expression was noted and
this, more interestingly, was accompanied by a signiﬁcant increase in adiponectin expression. Using a
co-culture system between macrophages and adipocytes, Rooibos extract signiﬁcantly decreased the
expression of all studied pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and particularly leptin, and increased adiponectin
expression. Thus, adding Rooibos tea to the daily diet is likely to prevent the development of obesity
associated with chronic low-level inﬂammation.

1. Introduction
In 2022, the obesity pandemic was one of the most prominent health issues that
occupied the attention of scientists, healthcare providers and the World Health Organization
(WHO), who classiﬁed it as one of the ten biggest threats to human health [1]. Obesity has
now surpassed categorization as a “medical condition”, and is considered a true chronic
and metabolic disease with its own pathophysiology and rate of comorbidity [2]. It is
estimated that by 2030, one billion people—that is, 1 in 5 women and 1 in 7 men—will

be obese, according to the World Obesity Atlas 2022 [3]. Obesity is clinically deﬁned as a
body mass index (BMI) over 30 kg/m2, and is characterized by an abnormal increase in
adipose tissue, leading to physiological dysfunction of the human organism [4]. It has a
complex etiology that could include genetic and epigenetic factors, environmental factors
such as overconsumption along with a sedentary lifestyle, and also psychological and
endocrinological factors [5]. The expansion of adipose tissue is mainly due to adipogenesis,
which involves the proliferation of preadipocytes and their differentiation into mature
lipid-accumulating adipocytes [6]. The differentiation may be regulated by many effectors
(including hormones and miRNAs), but the main regulators are transcription factors that
inhibit or promote the expression of proteins required for adipogenesis, chief among them
is Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) [7].
In addition to the well-documented impact of obesity on numerous serious diseases,
the COVID-19 pandemic has, once again, demonstrated the gravity of this health issue.
In the last three years, more serious consequences from COVID-19, plus a higher rate of
hospitalization and death, have been reported among the overweight and obese population
than among the population within the normal weight range [8]. Obesity causes a series of
metabolic dysregulations which could affect nearly every organ system, from the endocrine
system to the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system [9]. It is associated
with oxidative stress and chronic low-grade inﬂammation, characterized by the inﬁltration
of an increasing number of immune cells—mainly macrophages—into the obese adipose
tissue [10]. The resulting phenotypic switch in the adipose tissue leads to the appearance
of inﬂamed dysfunctional adipocytes [11]. This event is recognized as the ﬁrst stimulus for
the development of obesity complications that include insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipi-
demia, immune disorder, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, several cardiovascular issues
(from hypertension to heart failure) and over 13 types of cancer [12,13]. The inﬁltration of
immune cells into adipose tissue was ﬁrst noticed in the 1960s and, in 2005, the accumula-
tion of macrophages around dying adipocytes in a crown-like structure was shown. Since
then, signiﬁcant attention has been paid to this inﬂammatory reaction. The macrophages
are classically activated by the adipose microenvironment into M1 macrophages, which
are pro-inﬂammatory cells producing pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β
(IL-1β), IL-6, IL-12 and TNFα [14]. The inﬂammation of the adipose tissue is persistent
and fails to resolve, due to the continuous release of inﬂammatory mediators, including
the cytokines previously mentioned, and adipokines (i.e., leptin) and the lack of secretion
of anti-inﬂammatory adipokine (i.e., adiponectin) by adipocytes and resident immune
cells [15].
It is indisputable that lifestyle modiﬁcation is the ineluctable ﬁrst step in managing
obesity. This includes not only calorie restriction, but also several other new dietary inter-
ventions such as time-restricted eating, intermittent fasting and fasting-mimicking diets,
along with engagement in physical activities. Unfortunately, such behavioral changes are
insufﬁcient in most cases and adjunctive treatment, including pharmacological therapies
or surgery, is usually needed [16]. The main FDA-approved anti-obesity drugs are orlis-
tat, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, liraglutide [17] and, very recently,
semaglutide [18]. However, most of these drugs are associated with increased adverse
events, ranging from mild to potentially serious, which could lead to drug discontinua-
tion [19,20]. Thus, there is an urgent need to ﬁnd new and safer molecules that could treat
obesity or prevent its development. Natural substances from various medicinal plants have
shown a variety of pharmacological properties and served as sources of therapeutic drugs
against various acute and chronic disorders [21]. Since several medicines originate from
and/or are inspired by active ingredients in medicinal plants, the use of plant extracts and
their isolated metabolites is gradually coming to be considered a necessity, and medicinal
plants play a prominent role in the drug-discovery process [22].
Rooibos tea, produced from the south African legume Aspalathus linearis (Burm. f.)
R. Dahlgren, is a well-known health-promoting drink that contains a unique blend of
bio-active phytochemicals (ﬂavonoids or plant-derived phenolic compounds or phenolic

constituents), mainly aspalathin [23]. Rooibos tea has been consumed since the late 1700s,
but its potent antioxidant activity and health-giving properties have only been reported
in the past two decades, increasing its popularity [24]. Thus, Rooibos has attracted the
attention of several research groups, and multiple in vivo and in vitro studies have demon-
strated its signiﬁcant effect on insulin resistance, diabetes, cardiovascular complications
(mainly as an anti-hypertensive, through inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme),
inﬂammation, viral infections, ovarian function, and others [24,25]. The anti-obesity poten-
tial of Rooibos extract was ﬁrst reported in 2011 [26]; then, a research group demonstrated
its effect on murine preadipocyte cells, but no more data were found on its impact on
human adipocytes [27]. Thus, in this study, we further investigated the metabolic modula-
tory effect of Rooibos extract in an obesity concept, i.e., an obese inﬂamed adipose tissue
microenvironment. We hypothesized that because of its antioxidant properties, Rooibos
extract could interact with the inﬂammatory response of adipocytes. Ultimately, our study
could unravel the cellular mechanisms by which Rooibos extract works, and highlight the
use of this plant extract and/or its bioactives in the prevention and management of obesity
associated with inﬂammation.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Chemicals and Reagents
All solvents (water, ethanol, acetonitrile) and chemicals (sodium acetate, acetic acid
100%, hydrochloric acid 37%, phosphoric acid, 2,4,6-Tris(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ),
Trolox, DPPH (2,2-diphenyl1-pycrilhydrazyle), Ferric chloride hexahydrate, and Iron
trichloride) were acquired from VWR (USA) at HPLC grade. Aspalathin standard (primary
reference standard grade) was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).
2.2. Preparation of Aspalathus linearis Extract
The aerial parts (leaves and twigs) of green Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) were collected
from the city of Malmesbury, South Africa. They were sun-dried and shredded into pieces
between 0.1 and 0.5 mm. Then, 10 g of dried plant was extracted into a 200 mL ethanol–
water mixture (50%, v/v) and stirred on a rotary shaker (at 120 rpm) for 4 h at room
temperature. The mixture was then ﬁltered with a ﬁlter paper in order to separate the solid
and the extract. The extract was then concentrated using a rotary evaporator (at 40 ◦C) to
obtain 1.2 g of dry powder. The powder was then dissolved in DMSO and stored at −20 ◦C.
Final concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 µg/mL) were obtained by diluting the extract in
complete culture medium directly before use.
2.3. Quantiﬁcation of Aspalathin Content by HPLC-UV
Aspalathin was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) linked
to a 190–800 nm diode array detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Analysis was
performed with a Luna C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm × 5 µm; Phenomenex) column, with a pre-
column C18, at 20 ◦C and a ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min. The initial mobile phase was composed
of 85% solvent A (0.1% phosphoric acid in water) and 15% solvent B (acetonitrile), and
those percentages were maintained for 25 min. The percentage of solvent B was then
increased to reach 35% at 35 min and 90% at 40 min. This concentration was then held
for 5 min, before following a linear gradient to return to 15% at 55 min. Then, 10 µL of a
5 mg/mL (water/methanol, 1/5, v/v) Rooibos extract solution was injected. Quantiﬁcation
was performed using UV at 288 nm with an aspalathin standard.
2.4. Determination of Antioxidant Activity by Ferric-Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) Assay
and DPPH Radical-Scavenging Activity
FRAP reagent solution was prepared by mixing acetate buffer (20 mM, pH 3.6), TPTZ
solution (10 mM in 40 mM HCl) and FeCl3·6H2O solution (20 mM) in a 10:1:1 v/v/v ratio.
Trolox dilution solutions were prepared (0.1 to 1 mg/L). Then, 50 µL of extract or Trolox
standard solution, and 200 µL of FRAP reagent solution were mixed and incubated for one
Nutrients 2023, 15, 1751
4 of 19
hour at 37 ◦C. Absorbance was measured at 593 nm. FRAP was calculated and expressed
as µmol Trolox equivalent/g (dw).
DPPH reagent (0.180 g·L−1 in ethanol) was prepared. In test tubes, 100 µL samples
of workable solutions (dilutions of dry extract in ethanol) were combined with 3.9 mL
of DPPH reagent. The tubes were then kept in complete darkness for 30 min at room
temperature. Absorbance was measured at 515 nm. The effective concentration value
(EC50), which corresponds to the concentration of a sample producing a 50% reduction in
the initial DPPH concentration, was determined.
2.5. Blood Cells, Cell Cultures and Reagents
2.5.1. Blood Leukocyte Preparation
Blood was collected from healthy human volunteers (n = 3; Établissement Français
du Sang, EFS, Clermont-Ferrand, France). Donors gave their written informed consent
for the use of blood samples for research purposes under EFS contract no. 16-21-62 (in
accordance with articles L1222-1, L1222-8, L1243-4 and R1243-61 of the French Public
Health Code). Blood leukocytes were obtained by hemolytic shock using ammonium
chloride solution (NH4Cl 155 µM; NaHCO3 12 µM, EDTA 0.01 µM). Leukocytes were then
centrifuged and suspended in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 Medium (RPMI-1640,
Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with fetal bovine serum
(FBS, 10%) (Eurobio Scientiﬁc, Saclay, France), gentamicin (50 µg/mL) and glutamine (Gln,
2 mM) (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, USA).
2.5.2. PBMC Preparation
Blood buffy coats were collected from healthy human volunteers (n = 3 volunteers)
and carefully layered on a simple gradient of Ficoll–Histopaque 1077® (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA). After centrifugation (400× g, 40 min at 20 ◦C), the ﬁrst layer of
plasma was aspirated, yielding a phase of monocytes and lymphocytes (peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, PBMCs) just above the 1.077 g/mL layer. The phase with PBMCs was
washed with RPMI and centrifuged (5 min, 400× g) twice, and then suspended in 5 mL of
supplemented RPMI (FBS 10%, gentamicin 50 µg/mL, and Gln 2 mM). Cell preparation
was adjusted to 106 cells/mL for assays.
2.5.3. Human Monocytic Leukemia Cells
THP-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, TIB-202TM) were cultured in a RPMI-
1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM Gln and 50 µg/mL gentamicin. For
differentiation, THP-1 cells (4 × 105/mL) were incubated in 6-well plates in a complete
growth medium containing 16.2 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma-Aldrich)
for three days. Macrophages were then polarized into M1-like macrophages by incubation
with 20 ng/mL of IFN-γ (Gibco) and 10 pg/mL of lipopolysaccharides (LPS, Sigma) for
24 h.
2.5.4. Adipose Cells
Two preadipocyte cell types were used in this study:
-
Preadipocyte cells were obtained from patients undergoing surgery for cosmetic pur-
poses without associated pathology in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, from
anonymous healthy donors. Surgical residue was harvested in accordance with French
regulations, including a declaration to the Research Ministry (DC no. 2008162) and
procurement of written informed consent from the patients. Four different strains were
obtained from obese women (BMI > 30). For differentiation into mature adipocytes
(Mas), cells were seeded at conﬂuence (33,500 cells/cm2) in a differentiation medium
consisting of Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium (DMEM/F12 (1:1), Gibco) supple-
mented with 10% FBS, 1% Gln, hydrocortisone (25 mg/mL), insulin (3.5 mg/mL),
T3 (6.5 mg/mL), dexamethazon (980 mg/mL), rosiglitazone (1.78 mg/mL), isobutyl-
methylxanthine (IBMX) (100 mg/mL, only for the ﬁrst 3 days), and gentamycin

5 of 19
(50 mg/mL). The medium was replaced every two days. Mas were obtained after
8 days of differentiation.
-
The human subcutaneous preadipocyte cells were purchased from Lonza Group
Ltd. (Basel, Switzerland). The initiation and expansion of the cells used Preadipocyte
Growth Medium-2 (Preadipocyte Basal Medium-2 supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM
Gln, 30 µg/mL genistein and 15 ng/mL ampicillin). To induce differentiation, cells
were plated at 10,000 cells/cm2 in Preadipocyte Growth Medium-2. After 24 h, the
culture medium was changed to adipocyte differentiation medium, consisting of
Preadipocyte Growth Medium-2 supplemented with insulin, dexamethasone, in-
domethacin and IBMX. Cells were allowed to differentiate for 8 days with no further
medium change.
All the cells used were cultured in a 5% CO2-humidiﬁed incubator at 37 ◦C.
2.6. Kinetics of ROS Production by Blood Leukocytes
The blood leukocyte preparation was adjusted to 106 cells/mL and placed in 96-well
plates incubated with 0, 10, 25, 50 or 100 µg/mL Rooibos extract and dihydrorhodamine
123 (DHR 123, 1 µM, Sigma-Aldrich), and stimulated, or not (to check to the stimulation
efﬁciency), by 1 µM PMA for 120 min, as previously described by Cholet et al. [28]. The
ﬂuorescence intensity of rhodamine 123, which is the product of DHR 123 oxidation by
ROS, was recorded every 5 min for 120 min (excitation/emission: 485/538 nm) using a
microplate ﬂuorometric reader (Tecan Spark®, Männedorf, Switzerland). Results were
presented as a percentage of ROS production of stimulated treated cells compared to the
control, which corresponded to stimulated untreated cells (100%).
2.7. Leukocyte Viability
The same cell preparation adjusted to 106 cells/mL with supplemented RPMI (FBS
10%, gentamicin 50 µg/mL and Gln 2 mM) was placed in 96-well polystyrene plates
incubated with Rooibos extract at four different concentrations (10, 25, 50 or 100 µg/mL),
PMA (0 or 1 µM), and resazurin (25 µg/mL) [28]. Fluorescence (excitation/emission:
544/590 nm) was recorded every 30 min for 2 h using the microplate ﬂuorometric reader
(Fluoroskan®, Ascent FL, ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, USA).
2.8. Determination of Cytokine Concentrations
PBMCs (106 cells/mL) (n = 3 volunteers) were incubated with or without phytohemag-
glutinin (PHA, 5 µg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) and Rooibos extract (0 or 50 µg/mL) for 24 h.
ProcartaPlex™ Immunoassays (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, USA) were used for all assays [28].
All samples were run in triplicate and were assayed for 10 human cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12
p70, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-23, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17a, MIP-1α, and TNFα). Cytokine levels were mea-
sured using optimal concentrations of standards and antibodies in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. After completion of all the steps in the assay, the plates were
read in the Luminex Bio-Plex 200 System (Biorad, France) and the data were analyzed using
Bio-Plex Manager™ 4.1 software with ﬁve-parameter logistic regression (5PL) curve ﬁtting.
2.9. Quantiﬁcation of Lipid Accumulation
Oil Red O solution (0.5% in isopropanol) was purchased from Sigma, and staining
was performed following the supplier’s recommendations. In brief, 3 parts Oil Red O
solution were mixed with 2 parts water prior to the experiment to make up the working
solution (0.2% in 60% isopropanol). Cells were washed twice with PBS before ﬁxation with
4% paraformaldehyde (30 min at room temperature). The paraformaldehyde solution was
then discarded, and cells were washed twice with water before being incubated with a
60% isopropanol solution for 5 min and with the working Oil Red O solution for 20 min.
After 5 more washes with water, the cells were observed under the microscope. In order to
quantify the staining, the ﬁxed dye was redissolved in a ﬁxed volume of 100% isopropanol,
Nutrients 2023, 15, 1751
6 of 19
and the optical density was measured at 490 nm using the microplate ﬂuorometric reader
(Tecan Spark®).
2.10. Evaluation of Gene Expression by Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Following the incubation, total RNA was extracted with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen,
ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc). After the evaluation of the quantity and purity (Tecan Spark®),
DNase treatment was applied to remove any remaining genomic DNA (DNase I Ampliﬁca-
tion grade, Invitrogen) and cDNA reverse transcription (HighCap cDNA RT Kit RNAse
inhib, Invitrogen) was performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The
cDNA samples were diluted to 5 ng/µL. Ampliﬁcation reaction assays were carried out
using SYBRGreen PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA) and primers (Table 1) on a
StepOneTM machine (Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycling conditions were 50 ◦C for
2 min followed by an initial denaturation step at 95 ◦C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95 ◦C for 30 s,
60 ◦C for 30 s and 72 ◦C for 30 s. The experiments were carried out in duplicate for each
data point. The reference gene β-actin was used as an internal control for the normalization
of RNA quantity and quality differences among the samples. Genes were considered signif-
icantly expressed and their transcript measurable if their corresponding Ct value was less
than 35. The relative quantiﬁcation method (RQ = 2–∆∆CT) was used to calculate the relative
gene expression of given samples with ∆∆CT = [∆CT (sample1) − ∆CT (sample2)] and
∆CT = [CT (target gene) − CT (reference gene)]. Paired t-tests were used for comparisons
of gene-expression levels with at least two valid pairs of values. The rate of false discovery
due to multiple testing was controlled by means of the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure for
each comparison separately. Three independent experiments were performed.

2.11. Adipospheroid Generation
The objective was to generate 3D spheroids using human preadipocytes in order to
mimic the three-dimensionality of adipose tissue with its histological and physiological
properties. Two methods were tested in order to obtain the spheroids. We used two
scaffold-free systems in which the cells cannot adhere to the support, and thus can multiply
in 3D and form multicellular micro-tissues.
In the ﬁrst method, 20 g/L agarose (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc) of sterilized 0.9% w/v
NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared, sterilized for 20 min at 120 ◦C and put in MicroTissues®
3D Petri Dishes® (81 wells, Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to
obtain an agarose mold [29]. In these molds, cell adhesion is inhibited, and cells present
within the suspension spontaneously agglomerate to form spheroids by promoting intercel-
lular adhesion molecules. Next, a total of 200,000 preadipocyte cells/agarose mold were
seeded in the agarose mold and cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (supplemented with 10%
FBS, 1% Gln) at 37 ◦C in 5% CO2, resulting in the assembly of 81 potential adipospheroids
per agarose mold. At day 2, the differentiation medium was added as described previously.
The second method consists of using 96-well ultra-low-binding U-shaped-bottom
plates (Corning, Somerville, MA, USA) that promote cell aggregation and spheroid forma-
tion. A total of 10,000 preadipocytes/well were seeded and cultured in the DMEM/F12
medium (supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Gln); then, the spheroids were differentiated
Nutrients 2023, 15, 1751
7 of 19
for 8 days, with the medium being changed every two days. Imaging of spheroids in these
low-binding U-shaped-bottom plates was performed using Incucyte® (Sartorius, Göttin-
gen, Germany), an image acquisition and analysis system with a 10× objective. The total
spheroid area (diameter) was measured using Fiji and Incucyte® software. A minimum of
three spheroids were measured for each time point.
2.12. Confocal Microscopy
To assess the differentiation of adipocytes in the adipospheroids, we observed and
analyzed the lipid content by confocal microscopy. Firstly, adipospheroids were washed
in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, Gibco) after harvesting and subsequently
ﬁxed for 1 h at room temperature in a formalin solution (neutral buffered 10%, Sigma-
Aldrich). The adipospheroids were then stained overnight, protected from light, in 1:2000
Bodipy-FL (1 mg/mL, Invitrogen), 1:500 Dapi (1 mg/mL) and 1:500 Triton X-100 (5 mg/mL)
(ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc). After staining, the adipospheroids were washed three times
for 5 min in DPBS and then mounted in a special support (ISO18 10 mm deep, Ispacer®,
SUNJin Lab) using Vectashield (H1000 Vector, Eurobio Scientiﬁc) as a mounting medium to
observe the entire adipospheroids in 3D and avoid cutting or crushing them. The stained
adipospheroids were analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Micro Zeiss Cell Observer
Spinning Disk with Yokogawa CSU-1X scanning unit (×20 Plan Apochromat 20×/0.8 M27).
Bodipy FL was excited using a 488 nm laser paired with a 509/22 nm bandpass ﬁlter. DAPI
was excited using a 405 nm laser paired with a 450/50 nm bandpass ﬁlter. Equal light
settings were used for all images within an experiment and sub-ﬁgure.
2.13. Co-Culture between Macrophages and Adipospheroids/Evaluation of Cell–Cell Interactions
A co-culture system was used between THP-1 cells seeded at the bottom of wells and
adipospheroids added in inserts, allowing the effect of Rooibos extract on the interaction
between the two cell types through a porous membrane (Transwell culture system, porosity
0.4 µm) to be assessed. THP-1 were seeded at the bottom of wells (450,000 cells/cm2) and
the differentiation into adherent macrophages was induced by adding PMA for 3 days.
Next, the macrophages were co-cultured with the mature adipospheroids, with or without
the presence of IFN-γ, LPS and Rooibos extract (50 µg/mL). After 24 h of incubation, total
RNA was extracted with TRIZOL, and qRT-PCR was performed as described previously.
The experiments were carried out at least three times.
2.14. Statistical Analysis
All the experiments were performed 3–6 times; data are presented as mean ± SD. The
data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA or linear-regression analysis in GraphPad
Prism software version 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA). Statistical signiﬁcance
among several groups was assessed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s t-test.
Statistical signiﬁcance between the two groups was evaluated by Student’s t-test. The
p values were determined, and values < 0.05, < 0.01, < 0.001, 0.0001 (*, **, ***, ****, respec-
tively) were considered signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Antioxidant and Anti-Inﬂammatory Impact of Rooibos Extract
3.1.1. Aspalathin Content and Antioxidant Capacity
The analysis of the main compound in the extract showed the presence of 7.95% of
Aspalathin (dihydrochalcone C-glycoside) in the dry extract (Aspalathin content (AC)
≈ 80 g·kg−1).
The radical-scavenging capacity of the extract was determined using DPPH and FRAP
assays. The following FRAP and DPPH values, reﬂecting the direct antioxidant activity
of the extract, were found for the FRAP assay; 4543 ± 143 µmol Trolox equivalent was
found in 1 g of dry extract. For the free-radical scavenging activity toward the DPPH
radical, the effective concentration value (EC50), determined by a 50% reduction in the

initial DPPH concentration, was 0.00895 mg (of dry extract)/mL (Figure 1A). Thus, high
direct scavenging activity was found in the Rooibos extract.

compared with control. 
3.1.3. Rooibos Impacted PBMC Cytokine Secretion 
In order to determine the effect of Rooibos extract on inflammatory response, total 
PBMCs were stimulated by PHA in the presence or absence of 50 µg/mL of Rooibos 
extract, and the concentration of ten cytokines secreted in the supernatant was measured 
with ProcartaPlex™ Immunoassays. Rooibos extract significantly decreased the 
production of four pro-inflammatory cytokines, reflecting its anti-inflammatory effect 
(Figure 2A). A hugely significant decrease in IL-17a secretion(+ 90%, p < 0.05), followed by 
decreases in IFN-γ (–76%, p < 0.05), IL-12 (–60%, p < 0.05) and IL-23 (–46%, p < 0.05) were 
observed in stimulated PBMCs cultured with Rooibos extract in comparison to untreated 
PBMCs. IL-2 concentration was decreased by almost 45% (ns). Despite a downward trend, 
Rooibos extract was not able to significantly impact IL-1β secretion (−30% vs. untreated 
cells) due to interindividual variations. On the other hand, the secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and 
MIP-1α was not affected in stimulated treated cells vs. untreated cells, and a non-
significant increase in TNFα secretion was observed, mainly due to high variations 
between donors. Figure 2B is a summary of the overall effect of Rooibos on the main pro-
inflammatory cytokines in PHA-stimulated PBMCs. It can be observed that Rooibos 
extract modified the behavior of the pro-inflammatory cytokines.

3.1.2. Rooibos Extract Inhibited ROS Production by Blood Leukocytes
To investigate the potential antioxidant effects of Rooibos extract, we examined its
effect on ROS production by blood leukocytes triggered by PMA. PMA stimulation resulted
in a signiﬁcant increase in ROS production after 1 h of incubation. Incubation with Rooibos
extract inhibited the production of ROS in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1B). The
decrease was signiﬁcant after 1 h at 10 µg/mL (≈30%). After 2 h, a signiﬁcant reduction of
minimum 50% was obtained, with a reduction of more than 60% at 50 µg/mL and above
(−50%, −61%, –64% and –70% for 10, 25, 50 and 100 µg/mL, respectively). This effect was
not the consequence of a decrease in cell viability or proliferation, as the viability assay
did not show any signiﬁcant difference between cells incubated with and without Rooibos
extract in the concentration range 10–100 µg/mL after 2 h (Figure 1C). In light of these
results, the concentration of 50 µg/mL was selected for further investigations.
3.1.3. Rooibos Impacted PBMC Cytokine Secretion
In order to determine the effect of Rooibos extract on inﬂammatory response, total
PBMCs were stimulated by PHA in the presence or absence of 50 µg/mL of Rooibos extract,
and the concentration of ten cytokines secreted in the supernatant was measured with
ProcartaPlex™ Immunoassays. Rooibos extract signiﬁcantly decreased the production
of four pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, reﬂecting its anti-inﬂammatory effect (Figure 2A). A
hugely signiﬁcant decrease in IL-17a secretion(+ 90%, p < 0.05), followed by decreases in
IFN-γ (–76%, p < 0.05), IL-12 (–60%, p < 0.05) and IL-23 (–46%, p < 0.05) were observed
in stimulated PBMCs cultured with Rooibos extract in comparison to untreated PBMCs.

3.1.4. Rooibos Modulated the Polarization of Macrophages toward M1-Type 
To better investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of Rooibos extract, the production 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines was quantified in M1 inflammatory macrophages in the 
presence or absence of 50 µg/mL Rooibos extract. For this purpose, THP-1 cell lines were 
activated and transformed into M0, and then polarized into M1-type macrophages by 
adding IFN-γ and LPS. M1 macrophages showed cellular elongation. As expected, the 
mRNA expression of IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, IL-8 and CXCL10 (M1 macrophage markers) was 
significantly upregulated in the M1 population (Figure 2C), validating the successful 
polarization of monocytes into M1-polarized macrophages. Interestingly, Rooibos extract 
was able to attenuate the macrophage response to M1 pro-inflammatory activation by 
significantly reducing all pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure 2D).

3.1.4. Rooibos Modulated the Polarization of Macrophages toward M1-Type
To better investigate the anti-inﬂammatory effect of Rooibos extract, the production
of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines was quantiﬁed in M1 inﬂammatory macrophages in the
presence or absence of 50 µg/mL Rooibos extract. For this purpose, THP-1 cell lines
were activated and transformed into M0, and then polarized into M1-type macrophages
by adding IFN-γ and LPS. M1 macrophages showed cellular elongation. As expected,
the mRNA expression of IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, IL-8 and CXCL10 (M1 macrophage markers)

3.2. Impact of Rooibos Extract on Inﬂammatory State of Adipose Tissue
3.2.1. Rooibos Extract Reduced Lipid Accumulation in Differentiated Human Adipocytes
Next, we investigated the potential effect of Rooibos extract on obesity by determining
its impact on adipogenesis. Microscopic analysis of differentiated Oil Red O-stained
human adipocytes, cultured in the absence (Figure 3A) and presence of GW9662 which
is a PPARγ agonist (Figure 3B) or Rooibos (Figure 3C), revealed the accumulation of
intracellular lipid droplets. Chronic treatment with Rooibos extract appeared to inhibit
lipid accumulation. Quantiﬁcation of the extracted Oil Red O stain showed that the lipid
content was signiﬁcantly reduced by ∼36% (p ≤ 0.0001) when treated with GW9662 (used
as a negative control) and ∼20% (p ≤ 0.001) with Rooibos as compared to the control
(Figure 2D), indicating a reduction in intracellular lipid accumulation.

Differentiation of human adipocytes with 50 µg/mL of the Rooibos extract decreased 
the gene expression of PPARγ (Figure 3E) by 47% (p ≤ 0.001) and that of Ap2 by 43% (p < 
0.01) compared to untreated controls. Additionally, Rooibos extract significantly 
increased the expression of the Lipase E, hormone-sensitive type (HSL) gene by 186% (p ≤ 
0.001).

Next, the impact of Rooibos extract was evaluated in human mature adipocytes. For 
that purpose, human preadipocytes were differentiated as previously described for 8 
days. Next, the mature adipocytes were treated with 50 µg/mL Rooibos extract for 24 h 
and the expression of adipokines along with HSL was evaluated. Rooibos extract 
significantly increased the expression of AdipoQ by 346% and HSL by 380% compared to 
untreated controls (Figure 4B,C). A substantial decrease of 46% (p ≤ 0.001) was observed

Next, the impact of Rooibos extract was evaluated in human mature adipocytes. For
that purpose, human preadipocytes were differentiated as previously described for 8 days.
Next, the mature adipocytes were treated with 50 µg/mL Rooibos extract for 24 h and
the expression of adipokines along with HSL was evaluated. Rooibos extract signiﬁcantly
increased the expression of AdipoQ by 346% and HSL by 380% compared to untreated

shown to be biologically active, and can be maintained in long-term cultures and better
reproduce adipose tissue’s morphological and physiological behaviors compared to their
2D counterparts [30]. To achieve this objective, we took advantage of the ability of human
preadipocytes to agglomerate and form multicellular micro-tissues or “spheroids” when
forced together on non-adherent surfaces. To set up the system, we used the same hu-
man subcutaneous preadipocytes whose ability to differentiate in vitro was demonstrated
previously. Two techniques were employed to form the adipospheroids:
-
The ﬁrst method consisted of simply seeding the preadipocyte cells in speciﬁc U-
shaped ultra-low-binding plates where cell adhesion is almost impossible (Figure 5A).
-
The second method consisted of using agarose molds prepared with MicroTissues®
3D Petri Dishes® (Figure 5B). In these molds, 200,000 preadipocyte cells were seeded.
After 24 h of incubation, cells present within the suspension spontaneously agglom-
erated to form loosely adhesive cell spheroids by promoting intercellular adhesion
molecules, resulting in the assembly of 81 potential adipospheroids per agarose mold.
We then added the differentiating medium at day 2 and cells were allowed to continue
differentiating until day 10 in both methods. To verify the differentiation of spheroids
and their ability to mimic adipose tissue, the presence of lipid droplets was assessed by
adding Bodipy, a green ﬂuorescent dye with hydrophobic properties, ideal for staining
lipids, and then analyzing the samples by confocal microscopy. In Figure 5C,D, the stained

microscope (quantiﬁcation of spheroid volume). The measurement of spheroid diameter
using Fiji demonstrated that untreated adipospheroids expanded signiﬁcantly more than
the treated ones (Figure 6C). Similar to the adipose tissue that accumulates lipids when
preadipocytes mature into adipocytes, our results indicated that, during differentiation, the
spheroid volume increased over time, and as expected, Rooibos extract had the ability to
inhibit this process. At the end of the differentiation period, we measured the expression of
adipogenesis-related genes along with adipokines. The results indicated that the treated
adipospheroids expressed less Ap2, PPARγ and Leptin (–63%, –50% and –30%, respectively)
and more adiponectin and HSL (+60% and +33%, respectively) compared to untreated
adipospheroids (Figure 6D,E). These results generally conﬁrmed our results in 2D.

We utilized a co-culture system to examine the impact of Rooibos extract on the
inﬂammatory state caused by the interaction between M1 macrophages and adipocytes.
THP-1 monocytic cells were seeded at the bottom of wells and differentiated into M0 by
adding PMA. In parallel, adipospheroids were formed and differentiated in agarose molds
as described previously. This method was selected for the co-culture since it generates
a higher number of adipospheroids with 200,000 cells (81 vs. 20 spheroids for the low-
binding plates method). The adipospheroids obtained were subsequently co-cultured with
macrophages for 24 h in the presence or absence of IFN-γ, LPS to induce a pro-inﬂammatory
proﬁle, and 50 µg/mL of Rooibos extract. Next, total mRNA was extracted separately
from the macrophages and adipospheroids to perform qPCR (Figure 7A). Samples were
analyzed for the expression of markers of an M1-type phenotype, which represents a pro-
inﬂammatory immune response. Five established M1 phenotype markers were selected:
IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, TNFα and CXCL10. In addition, three adipocytes’ markers were examined:
adiponectin, HSL and leptin. The data showed that Rooibos extract generally decreased the
inﬂammatory state, reﬂected by a signiﬁcantly decreased expression of pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1β in THP-1-differentiated macrophages by 60%, 70% and 53%,
respectively, and the pro-inﬂammatory adipokine, leptin, by 56% in adipospheroids. These
results were accompanied by a signiﬁcant increase in the expression of HSL by 120% and
the anti-inﬂammatory adipokine, i.e., adiponectin, by 70% in the adipospheroids compared
to untreated co-culture (Figure 7B,C).

4. Discussion
Despite the fact that obesity is classiﬁed as a public health priority and is receiving
special attention from the WHO and governments in all countries, its prevalence is still
increasing worldwide, leading to great economic and social hardships along with high

levels of stress on the health services in all countries. All of this goes to show that the
obesity pandemic presents a real challenge for researchers, and new and improved ways to
manage weight gain and prevent obesity are urgently needed.
Knowing that the adipose tissue is the most important organ to be targeted and
studied when managing obesity, it is critically important to have a treatment that mainly
targets adipocytes and adipose tissue. It is surprising that most of the available approved
anti-obesity drugs mainly target the nervous system, mostly to decrease appetite and food
consumption [18], instead of adipose tissue itself. In our study, we focused on the main
factors in obesity responsible for chronic inﬂammation: adipocytes and macrophages. We
investigated the effect of Rooibos extract on both cell types with a view to managing the
obesity-associated chronic inﬂammation that leads to numerous serious diseases. Accord-
ingly, in addition to the conventional 2D cultures, we used a 3D system, and we veriﬁed
that the two tested techniques are simple and easily applicable culture protocols that allow
the culturing and differentiation of human adipocytes with in vivo-like morphology in
order to test new anti-obesity drugs. The two techniques allow the formation of mature
adipospheroids where the preadipocytes can accumulate lipid droplets and gradually
acquire an adipocyte-speciﬁc gene expression pattern.
Rooibos is known to contain high levels of valuable bioactive compounds (ﬂavonoid
antioxidants). Aspalathin is the speciﬁc ﬂavonoid to Rooibos, and it is abundantly present
in Aspalathus linearis, which explains the huge amount of interest in the potential health
beneﬁts of this ﬂavonoid. The other four main ﬂavonoids (nothofagin, orientin, isoorientin
and vitexin) in Rooibos extract are not speciﬁc and may occur in other medicinal plants
such as Leandra dasytricha [25]. The Rooibos extract used in our study contains 80 g·kg−1
aspalathin, which is in the range of the natural products containing Rooibos (8–12%) [31,32].
Generally, the consumption of 200 mL of Rooibos infusion would contribute 1.2–36 mg of
aspalathin to the diet [25], depending on whether the product is fermented or green. For
aspalathin and other bioactive compounds to be bio-effective, they must be bioavailable
and reach their site of action. The various factors affecting bioavailability (absorption,
distribution, metabolism and excretion) could lead to disparity in efﬁcacy results between
in vitro and in vivo studies. In this context, Huang et al. showed in their study that the
absorption of aspalathin in a Caco-2 monolayer cell model was concentration dependent
and could reach almost 100% of the initial dose in high concentrations [33]. The oral
bioavailability of aspalathin from Rooibos extract or infusion has been evaluated in vivo
using pig, mouse and vervet monkey models, in addition to three human studies. Overall,
the studies have shown evidence of phase-II metabolites in blood circulation. The glu-
conidated, sulfated and methylated forms of aspalathin were found in the urine following
phase-II liver metabolism after ingestion of Rooibos beverage or green Rooibos extract. The
presence of aspalathin in the plasma was detected in one human study only, where the
subjects drank 500 mL of green rooibos infusion, containing 287 mg aspalathin [34]. In the
other two studies, no ﬂavonoid metabolites were detected in the plasma and the authors
noted that a strong afﬁnity of the compounds for plasma carrier proteins such as serum
albumin could be an explanation for undetectable levels in plasma [35,36]. On the one hand,
we conﬁrmed the potent antioxidant activity of Rooibos extract associated in our study with
anti-inﬂammatory activity on blood leukocytes and THP-1-differentiated macrophages. In
our study, macrophages polarized to M1-type by LPS/IFN-γ treatment showed a reduced
pro-inﬂammatory response. The inhibition of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines involved in the
inﬂammatory process, including IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β and TNFα, is one of the ways through
which Rooibos extract seems to exhibit its anti-inﬂammatory activity. This effect could be
due to the inhibitory effect of Rooibos on the NF-κB pathway, a mechanism demonstrated
recently by Gbuza et al. which needs to be better elucidated [32]. The anti-inﬂammatory
effect of our extract can be attributed to several active ingredients that, in addition to as-
palathin, include vitexin, an apigenin-8-C-glucoside with various health beneﬁts including
antioxidation, anti-inﬂammation, fat reduction and glucose metabolism [37]. Thus, we
conﬁrm that this plant holds interest for the treatment of obesity-associated inﬂammation.

On the other hand, we showed that Rooibos decreased adipogenesis, decreasing the
lipid accumulation process in the adipose tissue which is the major lipid storage site.
This was mainly promoted by a signiﬁcant decrease in the expression of PPARγ, the chief
regulator of preadipocyte differentiation [38]. Interestingly, we also showed that Rooibos
signiﬁcantly increased the expression of HSL, which is an enzyme responsible for the
breakdown of triacylglycerols into fatty acids in adipose tissue [39]. This could have a
huge beneﬁcial effect on weight loss because HSL is known to have a major impact on
appetite, food intake and body weight [40]. Furthermore, it is essential to mention that the
adipocytes are known to secrete over 100 cytokines involved in crosstalk with other cells.
Among these, leptin and adiponectin have been shown to be therapeutically beneﬁcial
as a treatment for several obesity-related diseases [41]. The couple leptin/adiponectin is
being extensively studied, due to the opposing effects of these two adipokines [42]. In
obesity and associated metabolic diseases, a decreased plasma concentration of adiponectin
along with increased leptin levels have been found. An imbalance between the pro-
inﬂammatory leptin and the anti-inﬂammatory adiponectin has been shown to be associated
with an elevated risk of developing obesity-related complications. Our ﬁndings showed
that Rooibos extract signiﬁcantly reduced leptin expression in mature adipocytes, once
again reﬂecting its anti-inﬂammatory properties. Additionally, there is huge interest in
adiponectin and its analogs as a potential therapy, not only for all metabolic syndromes
but also for several cancer types [43]. To our knowledge, our team is the ﬁrst to reveal
that Rooibos signiﬁcantly increases adiponectin expression in 2D and 3D human primary
adipocyte cultures, contrary to the published results on 3T3-L1 murine adipocytes, where
adiponectin secretion remained unchanged after Rooibos treatment [27]. To our knowledge,
we are the ﬁrst team to demonstrate this effect on human adipocytes, which could be
attributed, once again, to aspalathin, in accordance with an in vivo study conducted on
obese diabetic ob/ob mice, where the authors demonstrated that serum adiponectin levels
were signiﬁcantly increased by the dietary feeding of aspalathin [44]. In the longer term, it
would be interesting to better investigate this impact by studying the effect of Rooibos on
the AMPK signaling pathway, which is the main pathway activated by adiponectin [45],
and the expression of adiponectin receptors in human adipocytes. Our results on adipocytes
highlight the interest in Rooibos as a treatment for obese patients.
Finally, one of the major ﬁndings of our study was that Rooibos positively impacted
the interaction between adipocytes and macrophages, mainly by decreasing the inﬂam-
matory state. The substantial weakness of in vitro experimentation is that it might not
actually replicate the results in an organism, and one of the limitations of our study is
the difﬁculty in reﬂecting the results in vivo. However, in our study, we used the 3D cell
culture system, which is more physiologically relevant and predictive and responds better
than the conventional 2D culture. In our co-culture system, we tried to mimic the reality
of the adipose tissue and to copy the existing cell–cell interaction to better understand
the mechanics of obese inﬂamed adipose tissue. Although not impossible, it is technically
challenging to discover the exact concentration and form of Rooibos that could generate
the same beneﬁts in vivo.
Our results clearly suggest Rooibos as an effective and safe agent for obesity manage-
ment and obesity development prevention in order to reduce the prevalence of obesity and
its harmful consequences. To our knowledge, there have been no previously published
studies where the effect of Rooibos on polarized macrophages has been evaluated. Fur-
thermore, an obese inﬂamed adipose tissue microenvironment was created by culturing
the adipospheroids (which are biologically more active than monolayer cultures) with
M1 macrophages. This is the ﬁrst time that Rooibos has been evaluated from the point
of view of “obesity”. Nevertheless, a huge amount of work remains to be completed,
which includes optimization of the dose, means of administration and the safety proﬁle
of concentrated aspalathin extracts. As a conclusion, our study veriﬁed that Rooibos ex-
tract could be a good candidate to promote healthy and well-functioning adipose tissue,

which is important for whole-body metabolism and wellbeing, by reducing the low-grade
inﬂammation observed in obesity.
