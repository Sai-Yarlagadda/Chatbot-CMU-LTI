ABSTRACT 
Weaving is a fabrication process that is grounded in mathematics 
and engineering: from the binary, matrix-like nature of the pat-
tern drafts weavers have used for centuries, to the punch card 
programming of the frst Jacquard looms. This intersection of dis-
ciplines provides an opportunity to ground abstract mathematical 
concepts in a concrete and embodied art, viewing this textile art 
through the lens of engineering. Currently, available looms are not 
optimized to take advantage of this opportunity to increase mathe-
matics learning by providing hands-on interdisciplinary learning

1 INTRODUCTION 
Weaving is a fabrication process that is shaped by art, mathematics, 
and engineering. For centuries, humans have used woven cloth 
to create artistic expressions through material, color, pattern, and 
weave [51]. These artistic expressions ofer an opportunity to ex-
plore mathematical representations and models for patterns and 
textiles. For example, weaving patterns can be represented mathe-
matically through the binary, matrix-like nature of the pattern [22]. 
The feel and drapability of the cloth can be analyzed geometrically 
through an understanding of the yarn tension, weight, and how 
the weaver interlaces the yarns together [12, 50]. Even the layering 
of the cloth can be defned mathematically through the use of set 
theory to group yarns into layers [12]. 
In order to create high-quality, complex cloth, weavers follow a 
process that mirrors the engineering design process [35]. They start 
by designing or choosing a desired pattern and analyzing the fac-
tors which will determine the feel and quality of their fnal product 
(drapability, the tension of the loom, and the quality of the yarn). 
They then plan a weaving strategy to achieve their desired fnal 
product given the constraints of the tools available and iterate on 
their design [37]. Weavers’ desire to create more complex patterns 
and the industry’s desire to mass produce these products has led not 
only to advancements in processes but also to multiple engineering 
innovations [8]. For example, the development of modern automa-
tion was driven by the introduction of punch cards to program the 
frst Jacquard looms [14] which led to modern-day computers. 
This connection between weaving, math, and engineering presents 
an opportunity to bring interdisciplinary learning into the class-
room [48, 49]. Interdisciplinarity brings together diferent disci-
plines, providing an opportunity for students from diferent back-
grounds to collaborate toward a shared goal. Interdisciplinary cur-
ricula can also improve student outcomes in education as well as 
support the learning of critical skills to bolster student success in 
future careers [27]. 
Past work has explored interdisciplinarity in primary and sec-
ondary education using weaving to teach mathematics and com-
putational thinking (e.g. [32, 39, 55]). However, the concepts being 
taught and the supporting weaving technologies are limited. Most 
used simple cardboard looms or even construction paper for stu-
dent pattern creation, restricting the complexity of the patterns and 
concepts that can be taught. 
Our goal is to take advantage of the complex mathematical and 
engineering relationships with weaving to create interdisciplinary 
instruction for post-secondary classrooms. Toward this goal, we 
developed SPEERLoom: an open-source Jacquard loom kit for sup-
porting arts, mathematics, and engineering learning. SPEERLoom 
supports the learning of mechatronic concepts and engineering 
design principles through its open-source design and assembly. 
SPEERLoom’s Jacquard capabilities allow it to create complicated 
design patterns, afording the instruction of complex mathematical 
concepts (e.g.linear algebra, vector calculus, and set theory). All of 
our designs, assembly instructions, and software can be found at: 
https://sites.google.com/view/speerloom. 
The aim of this paper is to disseminate the design of SPEERLoom 
and the results from an evaluation of SPEERLoom as a tool for 
weaving and supporting students’ interdisciplinary learning of art, 
mathematics, and engineering concepts in a post-secondary class. 
2 RELATED WORK 
Interdisciplinary learning in post-secondary classrooms ofers ben-
efts beyond those of single-discipline education [4, 5, 23]. Weaving 
provides an overlap of many disciplines but requires a loom specif-
ically designed for classrooms. Below, we discuss previous work in 
interdisciplinary learning, the interdisciplinarity of weaving, and 
currently available looms. 
2.1 Interdisciplinary Learning 
The National Academy of Engineering named interdisciplinarity 
as a key skill for future engineers [45]. Interdisciplinarity is the 
ability to understand concepts within complex social, historical, 
and cultural contexts, and to understand, evaluate, synthesize, and 
apply knowledge from diverse felds [30]. 
While research and careers in STEM felds increasingly embrace 
interdisciplinarity, there remains a gap in post-secondary educa-
tion to prepare students for this type of work [26, 34]. Traditional 
disciplinary education in engineering and math focuses solely on 
knowledge within domains without considering knowledge across 
disciplinary boundaries [4, 23]. Interdisciplinary approaches can 
help students gain critical thinking skills and the ability to apply 
“discipline-specifc" knowledge to real-world problems [5]. 
There are challenges to integrating interdisciplinarity in engi-
neering education [31, 59]. Classrooms need support for integration, 
which can come from technology [59]. The use of technology and ro-
botics have increased interdisciplinary outcomes in post-secondary 
classrooms [13, 19, 21, 29, 60], however, further research is needed. 
2.2 Weaving as an Interdisciplinary Field 
Both mathematical and engineering principles can be used to defne 
cloth, categorize its properties, and shape its fabrication. Weaving 
machines aford the re-contextualization of digital and computa-
tion in a non-typical application [15]. Recently, weaving has been 
explored as a way of fabricating electronics [11]. Applications have 
explored the ability to weave conductive thread into cloth with 
applications in sensing [61], actuation [62], and design [9, 17, 28]. 
Not only can weaving be used in engineering, engineering is a 
necessary component of weaving. 
Cloth is fabricated by interlacing vertical warp yarns with hor-
izontal weft yarns (Figure 1). Many mathematical principles are 
illustrated in weaving paradigms, including the matrix represen-
tations of pattern design. Weaving patterns are often represented 
as weaving drafts (Figure 2) consisting of four major components: 
Threading (which warp yarns are actuated by which shaft), Tie-up 
(which shafts can be raised together by a single pedal), Treadling 
(which pedal is pressed at a given time step), and Draw Down (fnal

describe how warp yarns connect to shafts (threading), how 
shafts connect to pedals (tie-up) and how pedals are actuated 
(treadling) to create the weaving pattern (draw down). 
cloth pattern). Given the binary nature of weaving [22], we can 
write each of the parts of the weaving draft as a binary matrix. 
Multiplying these matrices results in the matrix representation of 
the draw down, represented as: 
� = �� × ��� × �ℎ. 
(1) 
Where � represents the draw down,�� the treadling,��� the tie-up 
transposed, and �ℎ the threading (Figure 2). 
Once the pattern is modeled as a binary matrix, vector difer-
entiation can be used to count the interlacings of warp and weft 
yarns. Each row (weft yarn) or column (warp yarn) of the binary 
matrix representation of the cloth’s pattern can be diferentiated 
and summed to count the interlacings. This defnes the “weave 
factor" of the cloth [6] and can predict physical properties of the 
cloth such as sturdiness and drapability. Another property that can 
be mathematically modeled is the layering of the cloth [20]. The 
mathematical defnition of interlacings allows for a defnition of 
a singular cloth as a set of interlaced yarns, referred to as “cloth 
integrity" in this paper. More details on the specifc mathematical 
defnitions of these principles can be found in Appendix A 
Once a cloth is designed, the weaver can use these mathemat-
ical models, to iterate on their design to achieve the desired fnal 
cloth, following a process like the engineering design process [35]. 
Once their design is fnalized, weavers use a loom to fabricate their 
textile product. Weavers must carefully ensure tension is evenly 
held across warp yarns as the weft is interwoven into them to cre-
ate cloth. Looms have been expertly engineered over centuries to 
precisely achieve the perfect cloth [8]. Engineers must use systems 
engineering skills when considering the textile constraints and 
system interactions. Furthermore, they must use system construc-
tion skills when considering the loom’s robustness and durability 
enabling long-term use under tension. 
2.3 Looms as Interdisciplinary Learning Tools 
Weaving cloth using the concepts discussed in section 2.2 requires a 
versatile loom. Diferent loom types ofer varying versatility at the 
expense of increased cost. In this section, we explore this trade-of 
and discuss the benefts and detriments of three loom types: rigid 
heddle, shaft, and Jacquard. 
Rigid heddle and shaft looms are less costly than Jacquard looms 
but ofer less versatility with less control over individual warp 
threads. Loom cost is proportional to the quality of its construction 
and the number of heddles and shafts ofered. These looms range 
from tens to several thousands of USD. While the less costly versions 
are monetarily feasible for a collegiate classroom, they require 
signifcant expertise and time to warp and thread (described in 
Section 3.1). Changing patterns to explore diferent mathematical 
and engineering concepts means repeating this lengthy process, 
yielding low versatility and thus low classroom feasibility. 
Jacquard looms ofer the most weaving versatility by actuating 
each warp thread individually. Here we discuss two Jacquard loom 
types: commercial and DIY. Commercial Jacquard looms provide 
the highest quality cloth, but are costly. These looms are usually 
covered machines designed to be plug-and-play limiting the abil-
ity to "tinker" with them, thus limiting instructional support of 
engineering design skills. DIY looms are signifcantly less costly 
and allow for deeper exploration of engineering skills but produce 
lower-quality cloth. These trade-ofs between cloth quality, educa-
tional potential, and cost are important classroom considerations. 
Two popular commercially available Jacquard looms are the 
TC2 [44] and the Jacq3g [25]. Their cost is high – tens of thousands 
of dollars – making them infeasible as classroom tools. While the 
commercial availability of these looms afords more access to ex-
ploring the mathematical principles of produced cloth, it restricts 
the engineering skills that can be explored due to the opaqueness of 
the product and the legal protection of novel design advancements. 
To address the cost issue, many hobbyists and researchers have 
made afordable, personal Jacquard looms [1, 33, 40, 42, 46, 56]. 
Some [1, 42, 56] use serial actuation, reducing cost but increas-
ing the warp actuation time (shedding time) which must be done 
hundreds of times to produce a single cloth. Serial actuation looms 
range from 32 [42] to 60 [56] warp yarns. Other DIY Jacquard looms 
use parallel warp yarn actuation, decreasing shedding time, but 
increasing cost [33, 40]. To reduce their cost, these looms typically 
have fewer warp yarns (14 [33]–24 [40]), reducing cloth quality. 
These DIY looms are optimized for personal use, sacrifcing qual-
ity and efciency for lower cost. A loom specifcally designed for 
classroom use needs to balance enough cloth quality to teach the 
desired course topics, whilst being efcient, robust, and reasonably 
priced. 
DIY loom designs are openly available unlike their commer-
cial counterparts, often with websites describing the engineering 
processes [33, 40, 42, 56]. However, recreating the devices require 
specifc expertise, restricting the ability of students to be active 
participants in creating their own loom. 
3 SPEERLOOM DESIGN REQUIREMENTS 
A loom kit designed for interdisciplinary education in art, math, and 
engineering must facilitate time- and labor-efcient interactions. 
The loom must be robust, moderate cost, and relevant to weaving, 
math, and engineering. These requirements are delineated below. 
UIST ’23, October 29–November 01, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA 
Speer et al. 
3.1 User Interaction 
Ease-of-use and efciency are important design considerations for 
human-tool interaction [38, 43, 63]. Classroom technologies must 
also have these qualities to not distract from learning [52]. There are 
two typical human interactions with looms: warping and weaving. 
Each should be efcient, reducing non-educational work time. 
3.1.1 Warping Eficiency. Warping a loom is a lengthy process that 
consists of two stages: winding yarn onto the back warp beam, and 
threading the yarn through the heddles of the loom [37]. Winding 
requires the weaver to hold manual tension while stretching the 
yarn across pegs of a warp frame. Then the yarn can be transferred 
to the back warp beam where tension must be held manually as 
the yarn is rolled on. From here, the back warp beam is attached to 
the loom and the threading process can begin. Threading requires 
taking each warp yarn through the correct heddle carefully so as 
to not make mistakes, or the process must be repeated. To reduce 
the expenditure of classroom time on non-learning related tasks, a 
well-designed classroom loom should be easy and quick to warp 
and allow for corrections in the process should errors occur. 
3.1.2 Weaving Eficiency. A loom designed for classroom use should 
ensure there are as few as possible interruptions during the weav-
ing process to lessen distractions from learning. Weaving time on 
the loom should feel productive and efcient, requiring the shed-
ding time be as quick as possible. In an interdisciplinary classroom, 
student weavers will be novices and will inevitably make mistakes, 
e.g., a single warp yarn losing tension or breaking. These problems 
should be quick and easy to correct. 
3.2 Accessibility 
To be accessible for classroom use, the cost of the loom must remain 
low enough that multiple looms could be purchased by schools [18]. 
The accessibility of a device can also be increased through open-
sourcing the design [47], allowing users to customize the device to 
ft their specifc needs. 
3.3 Interdisciplinary Relevance 
As an educational tool for textiles, engineering, and math learning, 
the loom should be designed to aid in combining these interdisci-
plinary concepts without becoming a distraction [52]. Furthermore, 
the loom must support beginner- through higher-level concepts as 
students will have various backgrounds in each discipline. 
3.3.1 Weaving. To support novice student weavers, the loom should 
be able to produce a high enough quality cloth to weave beginner 
projects such as coasters, wall hangings, small pouches, scarves, and 
headbands [37]. To pattern these cloths with high enough fdelity, 
the loom should have at least 24 warp yarns [37]. Sufcient-quality 
hand-woven cloth is usually in the range of ≈8-36 ends per inch 
(EPI) [37], so the loom must support this warp density. For the pur-
poses of this paper, we will describe a cloth with at least 24 warp 
yarns and at least 8 EPI as quality cloth. The loom must be able to 
weave with minimal warp yarn breaking while keeping tension at 
≈50g-250g [37]. 
3.3.2 Mathematics. To facilitate the interdisciplinary learning of 
post-secondary math concepts through weaving, the loom should be 
able to weave patterns designed using mathematical concepts such 
as matrix algebra [22], weave factor [6], and cloth integrity [20], [50] 
(Appendix A). For students to see the results of matrix operations in 
their cloth, the loom should also be able to weave patterns with high 
enough fdelity. The defnition of quality cloth in the above section 
satisfes this requirement as 24 warp yarns at 8 EPI is high enough 
fdelity to see complex cloth patterns clearly [37]. Additionally, 
the loom should allow students to explore weave factor and cloth 
integrity (Appendix A.2) through the comparison of values for 
diferent weave structures (e.g., plain weave, twill weaves, satin 
weaves) and more complex weaves (e.g. Jacquard patterns) in the 
design and production stages. 
3.3.3 Engineering. The loom should support students as they ex-
plore the engineering design process [35]. It should allow them 
to consider systems engineering principles (designing under con-
straints and understanding system behaviors and interactions) [58], 
system construction principles (robustness and durability) [24], and 
engineering validation methods (modeling and testing) [24]. 
For students to explore concepts of systems engineering and 
construction, the loom should be uncovered. An uncovered design 
allows students to see the mechanisms, components, and their 
interactions. For example, students will be able to see an actuator’s 
behavior, consider what constraints lead to the selection of that 
actuator (e.g. cost, force), and see how that actuator interacts with 
other components (e.g. electronics, warp yarns). 
Designing a loom to be manufactured and assembled by students 
gives students the opportunity to see how system construction 
principles (i.e. robustness and durability) afect material choice and 
performance. For example, weaving requires the loom to hold a 
considerable amount of tension between warp beams, requiring 
sturdy materials to support this force. 
To support validation methods the loom should allow students to 
model and test diferent weaving drafts. Iterative testing of design 
will help students rapidly evaluate whether the fnal product will 
meet the intended form, ft, and function. 
4 SPEERLOOM DESIGN 
To our knowledge, SPEERLoom is the only open-source robotic 
loom kit created for and tested in higher education settings. In the 
following sections, we explain how the design of our loom meets 
our aforementioned requirements. 
4.1 Hardware 
We designed SPEERLoom (Figure 1) in accordance with the design 
requirements outlined in Section 3. We chose to make SPEERLoom 
a Jacquard loom that individually actuates each warp yarn to in-
crease the fexibility of possible weaving patterns and allow for the 
exploration of more mathematical concepts (Req. 3.3.2). Although 
matrix multiplication only relates to shaft loom weaving (as defned 
in A.1), artifcial constraints can be created through software to 
simulate a shaft loom using the Jacquard mechanism. This setup 
allows students to switch shaft loom patterns with no re-threading 
and minimal re-warping (Req. 3.1.1). 
SPEERLoom’s frame is made of t-slotted aluminum, ensuring 
that it is light, robust, and easy to assemble by novices (Req. 3.3.3). 
There are three main components of the loom: the front warp

UIST ’23, October 29–November 01, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA 
beam, the heddles, and the tensioning system and creel, shown in 
Figure 1. Aside from the t-slotted aluminum, components consist of 
3D-printed and laser-cut parts so the kit can be open source, easily 
manufactured, and lower cost (Req. 3.2). 
SPEERLoom is capable of individually actuating 40 warp yarns, 
balancing the cost of the actuators with the ability to produce qual-
ity cloth (Req. 3.3.1 and 3.2). The larger the number of warp yarns, 
the more complex a pattern can be. We chose to use more warp 
yarns than required by Req. 3.3.1 to allow more pattern exploration 
by students. Each warp yarn is threaded through a heddle which is 
rigidly attached to a linear actuator allowing simultaneous warp 
yarn movement, and decreasing shedding time and mechanical 
complexity over serial actuation designs (Req. 3.1.2). The cost of 
the linear stepper motor is lower than that of counterparts used in 
professional Jacquard looms but, due to its size, the heddles cannot 
be spaced as closely together as they would on a commercial loom. 
To overcome this issue, we divide the actuators into diferent planes 
in the frame design and ofset them to decrease the gap between 
heddles, achieving 12 EPI (Req. 3.3.1). 
From the heddles, the warp yarns pass into SPEERLoom’s ten-
sioning system and creel, described in the following sections. 
Figure 3: SPEERLoom’s novel tensioning system and creel. 
The creel has 40 individual cases with bobbins holding ≈ 
6 meters of yarn. The yarns are then passed through the 
tensioning system. Each frame has its own tensioning rod. 
(a)
(b)
Figure 4: SPEERLoom’s tensioning mechanism consisting 
of (a) two tensioning disks, a conical spring, and a spacer 
with the yarn (red) wrapped around the rod. (b) Model of the 
tension of the system. 
4.1.1 Tensioning System. To produce quality cloth it is important 
to maintain uniform tension in the warp yarns (Req. 3.3.1). In most 
looms, uniform tension is established by the weaver feeling the 
tension on yarns by hand. Correcting uneven tension is usually very 
time-consuming and the fxes can range from having to re-thread 
portions of the warp to having to place weights or cardboard pieces 
in parts of the creel. To optimize the warping process and minimize 
error recovery time for beginners (Req. 3.1.1 and Req. 3.1.2), we 
designed a novel tensioning mechanism that allows for individual 
setup, tensioning, and adjustment for each warp yarn. 
SPEERLoom’s tension system uses a passive mechanism to keep 
cost low (Req. 3.2). Each warp yarn passes through a set of tension-
ing disks forced together by a spring and held in place by a rod and 
spacer (Figure 3). The tension on the yarn is then dependent on 
the coefcient of friction between the yarn and the disks, �1, the 
coefcient of friction of the yarn on the stainless steel rod, �2, the 
force of the spring, � , and the angle of the yarn around the rod, �1. 
We approximate the tension on the yarn by modeling the system 
as in Figure 4. The normal force of the system is dependent on 
the spring constant, �, and the compression of the spring, Δ�. The 
tension on the yarn after passing through the tensioning device 
can then be expressed as: 
�� = (�� − �1�Δ�)��2�2 − �1�Δ� 
(2) 
The warp yarns are then redirected by a rod to align them horizon-
tally with the front warp beam, increasing the tension to produce a 
fnal tension, �� , dependent on the initial tension, �� , of the yarn 
and the compression of the spring, Δ�: 
�� = �� ��2 (�1+�2 ) − �1�Δ� (��2�2 + ��2 (�1 +�2 )) 
(3) 
Figure 5: Diferent warp yarn positions in SPEERLoom. Each 
heddle can be either raised or lowered, with the same amount 
of tension pulled on the warp yarn in either position. Yarns 
(blue and red) pass through the tensioning system and over 
the guiding rods before going through the heddles. 
After the tensioning system, the yarn passes through the heddles. 
The guiding rods and front warp beam are horizontally aligned, 
and the heddle frame is positioned such that the raised and lowered 
heddle confgurations are vertically equidistant from the front warp 
beam (Figure 5). This means that the total yarn length is nearly1 
equivalent regardless of the heddle position (up or down), ensuring 
reasonably uniform tension in the raised and lowered positions. 
1Distances vary slightly at the back, because the front-most guide rod contacts all 
warp yarns when heddles are lowered, and only the front-most yarns when heddles 
are raised. We considered adding an upper guide rod but found that, in practice, the 
tension was uniform enough (see Section 5.2.1). 
UIST ’23, October 29–November 01, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA 
Speer et al. 
Note that the total bobbin-to-beam lengths difer between individ-
ual warp yarns (owing to both heddle frame position and lateral 
defection to reach the reed); but this is not an obstacle to uniform 
tensioning because of our individually-tensioned creel. 
The passiveness of the system means yarns could lose tension 
while students are weaving on the loom (e.g., if they pull on a 
warp yarn accidentally when inserting the weft). This problem is 
easily fxed by novice weavers (Req. 3.1.2) requiring minimal efort 
(pulling the yarn and reeling it back into its bobbin) and minimal 
time (≈ 1 sec.). To recreate proper tension, the weaver need only 
reel the yarn back into its bobbin. 
4.1.2 Creel and Warping Routine. We designed SPEERLoom with 
a creel system (individual bobbins) rather than a warp beam (one 
unifed spool for all the warp yarns) that is typical for looms and 
used in all looms listed in Sec. 2.2. The creel eliminates the need to 
wind a back warp beam and makes threading easier to change (e.g., 
to fx mistakes) (Req. 3.1.1). To warp SPEERLoom, the weaver winds 
individual bobbins2, places them in cases, and installs the cases into 
the creel. Then to thread the loom, the weaver simply unwinds 
yarn from the bobbins one-at-a-time and threads it through the 
tension system, heddles, and reed, and then ties it down on the beam. 
Individual bobbins of yarn allow for quick partial warp exchanges 
if the weaver wishes to (e.g.) change half of the warp yarns for 
double cloth, makes a mistake in the threading process, or if a 
yarn breaks during weaving. This avoids a large potential source 
of discouragement for novice weavers (Req. 3.1.1 and Req. 3.1.2). 
4.2 Electronics 
SPEERLoom is equipped with 40 linear actuators [2], which are 
driven individually in parallel. SPEERLoom uses an Arduino Mega3 [3] 
which is easily programmable by novices [10] (Req. 3.3.3). The Ar-
duino commands 40 EasyDriver stepper motor drivers [57] through 
a series of MCP23017 port expanders [36] communicating over 
I2C. The frmware uses an interrupt system for driving the stepper 
motors with custom commands for running the motors designed 
for use by students from any background while remaining open for 
more advanced programming exploration (Req. 3.3). 
4.3 Software 
SPEERLoom’s graphical user interface (GUI), shown in Figure 6, is a 
Python program [53] that allows the user to create or load a pattern, 
visualize and explore the integrity and weave factor of their pattern 
(Req. 3.3.2), and control the loom (Req. 3.3.3). We chose Python 
to program the GUI in because it is an accessible programming 
language which then allows more advanced students to explore 
SPEERLoom’s algorithms (Req. 3.3). 
SPEERLoom currently has the capability to read in patterns as 
matrices stored in CSV fles. However, many weaving draft soft-
wares use the WIF fle type that must frst be converted to a CSV

After uploading a pattern, SPEERLoom’s GUI provides pattern 
drafting feedback (Req. 3.3.2) through an illustration of the weave 
factor of a given row or column (Figure 6) which helps novice

face allows the user to load a pattern, visualize the cloth,

and ‘Weave Factor’ buttons, and weave the cloth by using the 
‘Next Row’ and ‘Previous Row’ buttons. 
weavers notice long stretches of yarns without interlacement that 
create less sturdy cloth (Req. 3.3.3). The weave factor is calculated 
using horizontal and vertical pixel diference edge detection on the 
pattern matrix. This process is described in more detail in Appen-
dix A.2. 
Additionally, SPEERLoom’s software allows students to explore 
cloth integrity employing a novel algorithm (detailed in Appen-
dix B) to assess if a cloth meets the mathematical criteria for “falling 
apart". This enables students to explore custom, complex patterns 
not guaranteed to have good cloth integrity ( Req. 3.3.2). To our 
knowledge, our algorithm is the only real-time algorithm to calcu-
late cloth layering using Grunbaum and Shepard’s defnition [20] 
explained in Appendix A.2 and B. 
5 SYSTEM EVALUATION 
To evaluate SPEERLoom’s weaving quality, warping and weaving 
efciency, and cost we compared SPEERLoom against other com-
mercial and hobbyist looms. Our methods and results are discussed 
in the sections below. 
5.1 Methods 
We evaluated SPEERLoom on weaving quality (number of warp 
yarns, EPI, and tension), warping efciency (winding and threading 
time), weaving efciency (shedding time), and cost requirements 
(Section 3). We compare these results to other Jacquard looms (two 
commercial looms (the TC2 [44] and the Jacq3G [25]), one DIY loom 
(Albaugh’s loom [1])) and a shaft loom (the Ashford Katie Table 
Loom [16]). Warp winding and threading time were estimated based 
on the time taken by non-experts (SPEERLoom, Albaugh’s loom, 
Jacq3g, and Ashford) and estimated by loom experts for the case 
of the TC2. Shedding time was timed for weaving basic patterns 
where 50-58% of the warp yarns were raised.

Twill Weave, (c) Satin Weave, (d) Custom Jacquard Weave. 
For evaluation of SPEERLoom’s tension, we compare the mea-
sured tension to the Ashford shaft loom to ensure comparable 
variance in per-yarn tension to a standard two-warp beam ten-
sioning mechanism. Additionally, we evaluate our tension model 
through empirical measurements, ensuring the equation estimates 
the fnal tension properly. We estimated �1 and �2 through aver-
aged measurements of tension at diferent stages of the system in 
Figure 4. We frst varied � and measured �2 and �� to fnd �1 by 
averaging calculated values. We then varied �2 and measured �3 to 
fnd �2 by averaging calculated values. All values of tension were 
measured with a tensiometer4 for diferent stages of SPEERLoom’s 
tensioning system and the Ashford loom’s yarns. 
5.2 Results 
The results of the quantitative measurements taken for various 
looms are shown in Table 1 and discussed in the following sections. 
5.2.1 Weaving Qality. As shown in Table 1, SPEERLoom meets 
or exceeds the cloth properties (warp yarns and EPI) of other DIY 
looms. While SPEERLoom produces cloth of lower quality than 
commercial looms, we found that SPEERLoom is able to weave cloth 
meeting design requirements 3.3.1 and 3.3.2, specifcally meeting the 
defnition of quality cloth, as defned in Section 3.3.1 with regards 
to EPI, number of warp yarns, and tension. 
Figure 7 shows diferent cloths woven on SPEERLoom. SPEER-
Loom is able to weave basic patterns as well as more complex 
Jacquard patterns (Req. 3.3.2). These patterns were woven at 12 EPI, 
giving a sufcient quality of cloth (Req. 3.3.1). While this EPI is 
not as fne as commercial looms, it is more suitable for classroom 
use than other DIY options(Table 1). The lower EPI of Albaugh’s 
loom and other DIY looms results in lower fdelity of patterning, 
reducing the complexity and visibility of patterns produced cloth. 
Design requirements in Section 3.3 require SPEERLoom to be 
suitable for novice and experienced weavers. Student weavers in 
a class taught with SPEERLoom (see Section 6) had a range of 
4A Checkline Tensiometer Model TX SP-30 was used 
background experience with textiles, but were all able to accom-
plish weaving cloth on SPEERLoom. The students created custom 
patterns with matrix multiplication which can be clearly seen in 
Figure 10. 
Figure 8: A violin plot showing the measured tension of two 
looms. The y-axis shows the tension on each warp yarn, the 
x-axis shows the probability density of the measurements. 
SPEERLoom’s variance in tension is smaller than that of the 
Ashford loom. 
Figure 8 shows the tension on SPEERLoom and the Ashford loom, 
demonstrating that SPEERLoom’s variance in tension is comparable 
to that of the Ashford loom. SPEERLoom has an average of ≈199g of 
tension with a standard deviation of ≈10g (Req. 3.3.1). The Ashford 
loom has ≈63g of average tension with a standard deviation of ≈28g. 
While the average tension of the two is diferent, this can be adjusted 
on either SPEERLoom (by changing the compression of the spring) 
or the Ashford loom (by adjusting both warp beams) in order to 
ft the needs of a specifc weaving project. The variance of tension 
from yarn to yarn is something that cannot be easily adjusted on 
a two-warp beam style loom, as it would require re-winding the 
back warp beam. SPEERLoom’s yarns however can be individually 
adjusted to create a more consistent tension across all yarns. This 
shows SPEERLoom’s novel tensioning system is as consistent as 
an example two-warp beam tensioning mechanism, while saving 
time when adjusting individual yarn tension (Reqs. 3.3.1 and 3.1.1). 
5.2.2 Warping and Weaving Eficiency. We found that SPEERLoom 
was more efcient than all other looms with regards to warping 
efciency (Req. 3.1.1). Weaving efciency on SPEERLoom exceeded 
that of other the other DIY loom (Req. 3.1.2). 
SPEERLoom’s tension system and creel were designed to elim-
inate the need for winding a back warp beam to satisfy require-
ment 3.1.1. This process can take ≈3-5 hours depending on ex-
perience. SPEERLoom’s creel was assembled in 20 minutes by a 
researcher. As shown in Table 1, SPEERLoom’s per warp time is 
quicker than that of other looms satisfying requirement 3.1.1. This 
saves students hours of warping time for each warp pattern they 
wish to weave. 
To further satisfy requirement 3.1.1, SPEERLoom is more efcient 
or as efcient as other looms with regards to threading. When mea-
suring threading time, beginners threaded the Ashford loom [16], 
Jacq3g [25], and SPEERLoom. Threading time for the TC2 [44] 
was reported by Digital Weaving Norway. All threading time is 
reported per warp yarn to account for the diference in number of 
warp threads. An important aspect of the loom threading process 
for beginners is that a large amount of time is spent correcting 
mistakes such as threading yarn onto the wrong heddle or in the

Shaft Loom are Jacquard looms. In this work we use max EPI to mean the maximum achievable EPI of the loom with each 
warp thread possibly individually actuatable. Winding and threading time are reported as minutes per warp yarn to account 
for diferences in number of warp yarns.

wrong order. During the threading process for each of the looms, 
users made several mistakes. The diference we observed was in 
the time it took to recover from those mistakes. Threading yarn in 
the wrong heddle for the Ashford loom [16] or Jacq3g [25] meant 
having to redo most of the threading process. 
We observed novice student weavers threading SPEERLoom (see 
Section 6) and saw that when students made a mistake in threading 
their loom, it took them on the order of seconds to recover from their 
mistake. This was due to SPEERLoom’s ability to control, place, and 
tension each warp yarn individually, which enabled the students to 
swap and re-tension the afected yarns without having to re-thread 
any other warp yarns (Req. 3.1.1). In this regard SPEERLoom is an 
improvement over the commercial and DIY alternatives. 
As shown in Table 1, SPEERLoom’s shedding time is on par 
with other looms and, while it is slower than commercial looms, 
still satisfes requirement 3.1.2. The increase in shedding time over 
commercial alternatives is a direct result of the reduction in cost 
by a factor of 30. As compared to a serial mechanism in Albaugh et 
al.’s loom, SPEERLoom has a much decreased shedding time. This 
decreased shedding time is a direct result of the increased cost for 
parallel actuation, but allows students to weave twice as fast. 
SPEERLoom’s shedding time was not detrimental to students’ 
ability to weave quickly. Students weavers in a collegiate class were 
able to weave the projects shown in Figure 10 over the course of a 
single week (see Section 6). This duration of weaving is comparable 
to other looms. Additionally, students commented that they feel as if 
they saved time weaving on SPEERLoom by having the opportunity 
to mathematically explore their cloth properties, allowing for faster 
testing without requiring weaving time. 
5.2.3 Accessibility. SPEERLoom meets the accessibility require-
ments stated in Section 3.2 through its moderate cost and open-
source design. SPEERLoom is much less costly than the commercial 
options, and somewhat more costly than Albaugh et al.’s Jacquard 
loom [1] (Table 1). The cost diferential from the other Jacquard 
looms comes at the trade-of of quality and efciency. SPEERLoom 
has higher-quality cloth than Albaugh et al.’s Jacquard loom [1], but 
lower than that of the TC2 and Jacq3G. Additionally, SPEERLoom 
has a higher weaving efciency than Albaugh et al.’s loom which 
comes at the expense of higher cost. 
We designed SPEERLoom at a slightly higher price point to 
ensure the kit components would be durable, reusable, and reliable. 
Additionally, the open-source nature of SPEERLoom allows users to 
swap components, potentially decreasing overall price and allowing 
for singular components to be easily replaced. We also designed 
SPEERLoom to have more warp yarns and EPI allowing for more 
complex pattern exploration. Reducing the number of warp yarns 
and EPI to the minimal viable setup as stated in requirement 3.3.1 
would reduce the cost of SPEERLoom by ≈ $250 USD. 
In order to make SPEERLoom more accessible, we are currently 
working on reducing the cost of the frame (≈$270) by using more 
laser-cut and 3D-printed components and the electronics (≈ $300) 
by using diferent motor drivers. 
6 CLASSROOM STUDY 
6.1 Methods 
To evaluate our hypotheses that SPEERLoom supports post-secondary 
students’ interdisciplinary learning, we designed a course whose 
curriculum teaches concepts in weaving, engineering, and matrix 
math through the use of SPEERLoom. Course materials can be 
found at: https://sites.google.com/view/speerloom. We designed the 
course with input from engineering, math, and textiles instructors 
at Carnegie Mellon University and University of California, Irvine. 
Weaving curricula mirrored other courses [7, 41, 54], but focused 
on the relationship of engineering and math principles to weaving. 
The seven-week course was presented as a fipped classroom 
in a collegiate-level class. The course consisted of fve synchro-
nous in-person class sessions, each lasting three hours, and fve 
sessions of asynchronous lecture videos, lasting less than two hours 
each. During in-person class sessions, students worked in interdis-
ciplinary groups of three or four based on their background (i.e. 
textiles, math, or engineering expertise). 
The course covered basics in weaving, math, and engineering, 
aligning with requirement 3.3, and used SPEERLoom to support in-
struction. During the frst week of class, lectures (1.3 hours) covered 
the basics of textiles including weaving drafts, weave structures, 
basic loom components, and culturally signifcant weaving. The 
second week, lectures (1.5 hours) focused on mechatronic prin-
ciples including electronics and electromechanical actuation and 
their applications to SPEERLoom. During the in-person session, 
students began building their SPEERLoom kits. Week three of the 
course, lectures (2 hours) covered basics in linear algebra including 
vectors, matrices, basic operations with matrices (addition, sub-
traction, multiplication), and their applications to weaving drafts. 
Students continued building SPEERLoom during the corresponding

in-person session. Week four (lectures totaling 1.5 hours) built upon 
concepts taught in week three covering vector diferentiation and 
its application to weave factor and cloth integrity. The in-person ac-
tivities included weaving on SPEERLoom and getting familiar with 
its operation and basic weaving paradigms. The fnal two weeks of 
the class were dedicated to the student’s fnal projects. 
As part of the assessment of students’ understanding of the 
concepts, students completed a fnal project that required them to 
design an interactive textile and weave their design on SPEERLoom. 
Groups were observed during synchronous in-person meetings, 
while they worked on projects, and during fnal presentations. 
6.1.1 Participants. We recruited students from the class to partic-
ipate in research approved by Carnegie Mellon University’s IRB. 
Each student gave written informed consent to participate. The 
study consisted of thirteen students, seven of which participated in 
a post-interview. 
Out of 13 participants, 2 were male, and 11 were female. Students 
came from a variety of backgrounds: Fine Arts (n=7), Humanities 
(n=2), Engineering (n=2), Computer Science (n=1), and Information 
Systems (n=1), as well as class levels: Doctorate (n=2), Masters (n=2), 
Undergraduate (Senior (n=3), Junior (n=1), Sophomore (n=5)). 
6.1.2 Data Analysis. We gathered data from observations during 
class, post-interviews, and anonymized classwork. Observations of 
students were collected as semi-structured feld notes focusing on 
group dynamics, engagement, student expression of afect or ability, 
and physical interactions. Observations were collected during each 
in-person class session by trained researchers. Only groups where 
all students participated were observed (groups 2-4). Observational 
notes were then collected and thematic analysis was performed 
on the notes. Observations were categorized into groups based on 
course activity (loom assembly, weaving, other course activities) 
and topic of student expression (efcacy, learning, group dynamic). 
Each category was summarized and recurring themes were noted. 
We found themes pertaining to student engagement, student expres-
sion of confdence or learning of art, math, or engineering skills, 
and student perception of groupmates’ efcacy. 
Students participated in 20-minute post-course interviews report-
ing on efects on self- and other-efcacy, learning of art, math, and 
engineering skills, and SPEERLoom interactions. Questions focused 
on if and how the assembly of and interactions with SPEERLoom af-
fected their skills in art, math, and engineering ("Did building your 
loom afect your engineering skills?") and if they feel they learned 
from these experiences ("Did you feel you learned anything about 
math, engineering or art throughout the class?"). Thematic analysis 
was performed on the interview data using the same categories and 
themes as the observational data. 
Collected coursework included surveys of student background, 
student refections on activities, post-lecture quizzes, and fnal 
project assessments. 
Themes from observations, interviews and assignments (includ-
ing the fnal project) were categorized into engineering learning 
from assembly and interdisciplinary learning from other course 
activities. These fndings are discussed in the sections below. 
6.2 Engineering Learning During Assembly 
We predicted students would learn system construction skills and 
would consider systems engineering concepts while assembling 
SPEERLoom. From our observations of student assembly and stu-
dents’ refections on the assembly process during interviews, we 
found they did explore these concepts. Six of the seven students 
reported their engineering skills increased through the building in-
teraction with SPEERLoom. The remaining student reported SPEER-
Loom’s assembly was a new application of their skills. 
Four students reported considering the systems engineering prin-
ciples regarding the design of the loom during assembly (Req. 3.3.3). 
Some students did not initially look at the assembly process as 
learning because they were simply following instructions. How-
ever, upon diving deeper into their interaction, they recall applying 
problem-solving skills and considering design elements when they 
struggled with the instructions. 
It was more putting parts together rather than actually 
messing with any of the things themselves... Can I take 
back what I said about the engineering earlier? The 
whole process helped with engineering and thinking 
about interactive design. (S8) 
SPEERLoom’s open design allowed students to refect on other 
systems engineering aspects, i.e., the requirements of a loom, the de-
sign decisions made to satisfy them, and component design within 
the system (Req. 3.3.3). Students were observed misassembling the 
loom, breaking components in the process. Students used these 
UIST ’23, October 29–November 01, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA 
Speer et al. 
points of friction as a learning exercise to understand the function 
of the broken or misasembled part and brainstorm components that 
achieve the same functionality. For example, one group struggled 
to mount the rods on the back of the loom, but S10 was able to fnd 
a diferent mounting method that could hold the same amount of 
force. 
Students also refected on SPEERLoom’s weaving capabilities 
as well as design modifcations that could be made to increase 
its capabilities (Figure 9). Students refected on component design 
considering how diferent components could be redesigned within 
the parameters of the machine. For example, we observed that 
students in group 2 struggled with assembling the feet of the loom 
and discussed changes that could be made to the 3D-printed parts 
to improve the assembly process while still providing a sturdy base 
for the loom. These refections increased their understanding of 
engineering concepts and helped them complete the assembly. 
Four students reported learning system construction skills (Req. 
3.3.3). Some groups split into pairs during the assembly process, 
lead by students more experienced in engineering. We observed less 
experienced students learning about system construction from their 
assembly partners. S5 reported learning a lot from a group member 
with a mechanical engineering background because “[they] knew 
a lot about how to build the loom so there were things [they were] 
able to explain". More experienced students would note the applica-
tion of diferent theoretical knowledge in engineering and how it 
could apply to the real-world example of SPEERLoom, for example 
a student’s application of their knowledge of friction (Figure 9). We 
observed more experienced students in group 4 teaching S2 the 
basics of fastening pieces together with screws and nuts in the be-
ginning of the assembly. S2 commented on their lack of experience 
(Figure 9) but by the end of the assembly they were completing 
these tasks without help and reported they “were more confdent 
in [their] ability to learn things". 
6.3 Interdisciplinary Learning 
During observations and interviews, students often referenced 
learning art, engineering, or math in the context of other disciplines. 
For example, students considered how the systems engineering of 
SPEERLoom infuenced its creation of textile art and considered 
how they could apply the engineering design process [35] to their 
artistic designs (Figure 11). Additionally, students discussed learn-
ing math and weaving together, speaking to the linear algebra skills 
used to create and describe artistic expression in the form of textile 
patterns. These fndings are further discussed in the sections below. 
6.3.1 Engineering and Art. In accordance with requirement 3.3.3, 
students were able to trace the weaving process from the computer 
input to the electronics to the mechatronic actuators. In week 4, 
when group 3 ran their SPEERLoom for the frst time, students 
came together to use learned knowledge and prior experience to 
holistically analyze the weaving process of SPEERLoom. S7 ex-
plained to their group how the computer commanded the Arduino, 
which controlled each motor. S11 then explained how the motors 
are creating the shed on the loom by raising the warp yarns, allow-
ing them to pass a shuttle through and create a row of weaving. 
The team then discussed how the moving motors were impacting 
their cloth design. In this interaction, novice students learned how

mathematical principles of their design. (c) Final prototype. 
mechatronic elements serve specifc purposes, applying general 
engineering skills to weaving. 
During the fnal project, students reported learning about weav-
ing through the context of engineering challenges (Req. 3.3). Due 
to the physicality of their produced cloth, students had to consider 
constraints and change their artistic design through the use of 
their engineering problem-solving skills. This happened in both 
the feasible design steps and test model steps shown in Figure 11. 
Our [fnal project] was iterated on in a way that felt 
like engineering to me. It was kind of iterative, [we 
would] talk about a solution and then pick it apart in 
conversation and then go back to a new idea, iterating 
in a problem-oriented way of thinking that usually 
happens in engineering. (S7) 
Another student reported that when designing their cloth for 
the fnal project, their team originally designed something too 
large and over ambitious for the timeline and cloth size constraints, 
leading them to scale their project down to optimize for the physical 
constraints they had. This is captured in Figure 11 as the transition 
from blue sky design to feasible design. 
Students also discussed other engineering considerations afect-
ing weaving interactions and the “potential for the loom to make 
more complicated things for them" (S15). S2 expressed that using 
SPEERLoom’s software to visualize their fnal design enhanced 
their artistic skills and allowed them to better picture how the cloth 
would come together. 
6.3.2 Math and art. In order to satisfy design requirement 3.3.2, 
the curriculum included matrices and their basic operations as they 
apply to weaving. All but one student reported in the interviews 
that they learned math skills in the class. The singular student 
who did not mention their math skills increased reported having 
a strong background in math. Many students reported that the 
contextualization of matrix multiplication in weaving was more

meaningful to them than previous experiences learning linear al-
gebra. S11 stated the interactions with SPEERLoom gave them “a 
more nuanced understanding of the math". S15 even reported 
The transfer of calculations back to a physical fabric 
helps stimulate my brain in a diferent way and see 
math in a physical fabric. 
Students echoed this sentiment through their interviews saying 
that the calculation of weave factor “refreshed those [matrix con-
cepts]" (S5) and after “understanding the matrices and how it makes 
[patterns] ... calculating the [weave factor] then calculating the ma-
trices refreshed how to do those things" (S10). Although the weave 
factor could be automatically calculated, students still made smaller 
pattern calculations by hand, using the automatic calculation only 
for verifcation. Students reported “learning about weaving drafts 
was good for [their] math skills" (S8) and it was “cool to see how 
math can make patterns" (S2). 
The students demonstrated their learning and solidifed direct 
connections between textile art and matrix math during the fnal 
project. Students used matrices to create their fnal patterns (Fig-
ure 11, model step) and the weave factor to determine the physical 
properties of their cloth (Figure 11, test model step). Student calcu-
lated the weave factor prior to weaving their cloth realizing their 
cloth may not have the desired physical properties for the designed 
application. For example, one group made a woven book with a 
weaving pattern that would yield a loose cloth unsuitable to bind 
into a book. They discovered this by calculating the weave fac-
tor and then applied a diferent weaving paradigm to increase the 
weave factor and strengthen their cloth. 
Overall, interactions with SPEERLoom were reported to have 
supported the student’s learning in the class. S8 captured the course’s 
interdisciplinarity, reporting “Art-wise [interactions with SPEER-
Loom] helped with thinking about patterns and how models and 
prototypes are represented as actual things. With the weaving drafts 
[SPEERLoom helped with] how they translate the 0s and 1s into an 
6.4 Discussion 
From observations, interviews, and students’ assignments we saw 
students increase their understanding of engineering (systems engi-
neering and construction), math (matrices and matrix operations), 
textiles (weaving patterns and paradigms), and the intersection 
of disciplines., i.e., connections between artistic and engineering 
design, creation of textiles with matrix multiplication, and mathe-
matical modeling of textiles (weave factor and cloth integrity). 
SPEERLoom’s open-source kit design allowed students to explore 
the system’s design and construction, thinking about component 
function and diferent methods of satisfying system constraints. 
This was seen during points of mechanical failure which students 
used as learning opportunities. Commercial looms do not have 
this afordance as their designs minimize set-up labor and user 
interference with the device. To support engineering education, the 
design of devices should allow for the exploration of engineering 
design and application of engineering skills as SPEERLoom does. 
SPEERLoom was also able to support an increase in student-
reported interdisciplinary skills. During the fnal project, we ob-
served all groups naturally approach the problem using a process 
that mirrored engineering design. Students modeled their designs 
mathematically, reporting that the contextualization of matrix math 
in a hands-on application made the concepts more meaningful than 
in other linear algebra classes. Using these models students pre-
dicted the physical properties of their cloths and re-engineered 
them to ft an artistic goal. This shows that SPEERLoom can sup-
port an interdisciplinary curriculum combining weaving, math, and 
engineering which contextualizes difcult concepts in new ways. 
While students expressed satisfaction with the class, they also 
reported areas for improvement, specifcally regarding the time 
allotted for each section of the course. Students felt time constrained 
while constructing their looms, and they had to spend ≈2 hours 
on average building their looms outside of class. Students also 
expressed a desire to have spent more than a week on each topic to 
have more opportunities for practice and review. 
Future course iterations will be expanded to a full semester and 
take into consideration student feedback by allocating more time 
actual design".

to each topic. These courses will also expand on math, engineer-
ing, and weaving subject matter by, for example, increasing the 
number of matrix operations covered and teaching the principles 
behind linear optimization which have interesting ties to weaving 
and weaving drafts. Additionally, SPEERLoom’s design afords easy 
customization, allowing students to explore engineering principles 
beyond the construction of a pre-designed machine. Finally, SPEER-
Loom’s individually tensioned warp yarns allow students to weave 
with less traditional materials and the continuous motors allow 
weaving with a non-binary shed. With more course time, these 
complex weaving concepts could be taught using SPEERLoom. 
7 CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented the design of SPEERLoom, an open-
source, Jacquard loom kit for classroom use. SPEERLoom’s designs 
and other materials are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/ 
speerloom. We have listed a set of design requirements necessary 
for a loom to be an efective classroom tool for supporting interdis-
ciplinary learning including efcient user interaction, accessibility, 
and interdisciplinary relevance. SPEERLoom satisfes these require-
ments through its novel tensioning system and creel which create 
efcient warping and weaving interactions for beginner weavers. 
SPEERLoom is accessible to classrooms with its moderate cost and 
open-source design. Finally, SPEERLoom was used in a collegiate 
classroom to support students interdisciplinary learning in textiles, 
math, and engineering. Students reported learning skills in these 
disciplines and in the intersection of these disciplines. We conclude 
that SPEERLoom supports efcient user interaction, is accessible for 
the classroom, and supports interdisciplinary engagement. We have 
shown that SPEERLoom supports learning for a few of the many 
concepts within weaving, mathematics, and engineering. There are 
still many concepts that bridge the disciplines of weaving, math, 
and engineering that we will explore further in our future work.

A MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES IN WEAVING 
There are multiple mathematical concepts illustrated in weaving 
and textile production. These concepts include the binary, matrix-
like nature of weaving drafts [22], geometric analysis of yarn weight, 
tension, and path [12, 50], and the mathematical defnition of cloth 
layers through the use of set theory [12]. In this section, we explore 
the specifc mathematical defnitions of these concepts. 
A.1 Weaving and Matrix Multiplication 
Woven cloth is created by the interlacing of warp and weft yarns 
(Figure 12). Warp yarns run vertically through the loom and are 
raised or lowered to control how the horizontal weft yarn is inter-
laced by the weaver. Weaving patterns for shaft looms are often 
presented as weaving drafts (Figure 2). These drafts use diferent 
visual descriptors to show how a shaft loom is set up in a way that 
will create the visualized pattern. These visualizations are threading 
(which warp yarns are threaded through and actuated by which 
shaft), tie-up (which shafts are tied together to a single pedal), tread-
ling (which pedal the weaver should press at a given time step to 
raise the shafts), and draw down (fnal cloth pattern).

Figure 12: An illustration of plain weave cloth showing the 
warp and weft yarns. 
Given the binary nature of weaving [22], we can write each of 
the parts of the weaving draft as a binary matrix (Figure 2). These 
matrices are TR (treadling), Tu (tie-up), Th (threading), and D (draw 
down) Multiplying these matrices as: 
� = �� × ��� × �ℎ 
(4) 
results in the matrix representation of the draw down, where zero 
represents the weft yarn showing in the cloth, and one represents 
the warp yarn showing. 
A visualization of the multiplication is shown in Figure 13. Mul-
tiplying the treadling with the tie-up (� = �� ×��� ) yields a matrix 
UIST ’23, October 29–November 01, 2023, San Francisco, CA, USA 
Speer et al. 
that describes which shafts will be raised at each time step (repre-
sented as a row in the � matrix). Multiplying this result with the 
threading (� = � × �ℎ) then describes what warp yarns will be 
raised at each time step, telling the weaver for each row of their 
cloth which warp yarns show and which are covered by weft yarns.

A.2 Mathematical Modeling of Cloth Properties 
Cloth properties such as layering and drapability can be modeled 
mathematically. The layering of the cloth is defned through con-
structing a set of yarns in the layer through set theory and refer-
enced as cloth integrity. The drapability of the cloth can be mathe-
matically modeled through the weave factor. These defnitions are 
discussed in the sections below. 
A.2.1 Cloth Integrity. Grunbaum and Shephard [20] defne a key 
requirement that a valid weaving pattern must not “fall apart", 
meaning that one cloth forms a bound layer. If there exists a set of 
yarns, �, that always go over a set of yarns, �, it will separate from 
the � yarns and thus � and � are not the same layer of cloth. If a 
cloth falls apart it does not have “cloth integrity" 
We defne the � set as containing two subsets: the columns of 
the � set (�� ), and the rows of the � set (�� ). We defne �� and 
�� similarly. Representing the pattern as a binary matrix, we can 
state this defnition mathematically by saying a cloth, � , will “fall 
apart" if and only if there exists sets � = �� ∪ �� , �� ≠ ∅, �� ≠ 
∅ and � = �� ∪ �� , �� ≠ ∅, �� ≠ ∅ such that � ∩ � = ∅ and 
{� (�� , �� )}�� ∈�� ,�� ∈�� = {1} and {� (�� ,�� )}�� ∈�� ,�� ∈�� = {0}, 
where the function � (�, �) is accessing the value of the pattern 
matrix at row � and column �. An example pattern ftting this 
defnition can be found in Figure 14. 
A.2.2 Weave Factor. The cloth’s sturdiness and drapability can be 
described through the cloth’s weave factor [6]. The weave factor of 
a cloth accounts for the number of interlacings of warp and weft 
yarns and is expressed as � = � 
, a ratio of the number of yarns per 
� 
pattern repeat (�) to the number of times the pattern changes value 
(� ). When the warp and weft interlacings are diferent, the weave 
factor must be calculated for each warp and weft as �1 and �2 
respectively. �1 is calculated by the ratio of the number of warp 
yarns (�1), to the number of times a row switches values (�2). �2 
is then the complement of this as the ratio of the number of weft 
yarns (�2), to the number of times a column switches values (�1). 
When the number of interlacings is not equal in a pattern’s repeat, 
as is usual for Jacquard patterns, the irregular weave factor must
Í 
be calculated as � = Í� 
� .

SPEERLoom’s software uses a novel algorithm to determine a 
cloth’s integrity. We use the defnition of cloth integrity as defned 
in section A.2. The brute force method to determine if a pattern 
has integrity is to examine all possible sets of A yarns and B yarns 
and determine if any satisfy the defnition. This algorithm runs in 
� (2� � ) time, for � columns and � rows. As shown by Figure 15, 
this works for smaller patterns (number of warp yarns less than 12) 
but takes too long to run for larger patterns, making it unfeasible 
for student to use to explore SPEERLoom patterns of 40 warp yarns. 
SPEERLoom’s algorithm, explained in Algorithm 1, examines 
each column and iteratively attempts to fnd an � and � set, con-
taining the current column, that are not in the same layer. If no 
such set exists for any of the columns, we conclude the cloth is a 
singular layer. This algorithm is able to run at interactive rates as 
it has complexity � (� (� + � )). Even for large numbers of warp

yarns, the algorithm is able to run in less than one second, as shown 
in Figure 15.
