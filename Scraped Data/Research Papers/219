ABSTRACT
Background: Cowpea is a climbing annual crop from Fabaceae family which is grown for its edible seeds and pods. Cowpea is rich
in various nutrients such as fibre, protein, iron, potassium and is low in fat and calories. It has been observed that non-Communicable
diseases are increasing at a rapid rate in India as well as globally. The need of the hour is to control the rate of diseases through
modification in dietary practices. This study has focused on formulation of whole cowpea pod enriched composite flour by including
more fibre and various nutrients in the diet.
Methods: In the study, composite flour using whole cowpea pod flour, barley husk flour and whole wheat flour was developed. The
nutritional characteristics of composite flour and barley husk were analyzed. Storage study with two different packaging materials
was also done.
Result: The composite flour was found to have good nutritional properties as it contained valuable amount of protein, energy and
crude fibre. It was also found that the flour had higher content of iron, magnesium and calcium while barley husk had higher content
of manganese. Laminated aluminium pouches found to be more suitable for use as a packaging material.
Key words: Composite Flour, Cowpea pod, Fibre, Non-Communicable Diseases, Protein.

INTRODUCTION
Cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] is a member of the
Phaseoleae tribe of the Leguminosae family. As it is
harvested before cereal crops, it is called the “hungry-season
crop”. Cowpea has an annual worldwide production of about
4.5 million metric tons and thus provides food for millions of
people, in developing countries. Cowpea is also said to be
a good source of soluble and insoluble dietary fibre, phenolic
compounds, minerals and many other functional
compounds, including B group vitamins. It also aids in
reduction of several diseases such as cardiovascular
diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, hypercholesterolemia,
obesity, diabetes and several types of cancers (Jayathalike
et al., 2018). In rain fed areas, cowpea can be easily grown
with minimum and maximum temperatures of 28 and 30C
(night and day) Best yields of cowpea can be obtained in
well-drained sandy loam to clay loam soils having pH
between 6 and 7 (Dugje et al., 2009).
Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is one of the antiquated
cereals grown today. After wheat, rice and maize, barley
stands at fourth position in the top most cultivated crops.
Barley helps in prevention of many diseases such as high
blood pressure, chronic heart disease and gallstones.
According to Idehen et al. (2017) barley is credited for its
health benefits especially due to high content of β-glucan
fibre. Around 10-13 per cent weight of total barley is due to
its husk however it is not used in value added applications
in spite of its high  hemicellulose content. Arabinoxylan is a
significant hemicellulose found in barley husk.
Wheat is the most important staple  crop used for human
consumption and its demand is increasing globally due to
industrialization and urbanization. Hexaploid specie that is
“Triticum aestivum”, also called “common” or “bread” wheat
is the major species of wheat grown  world wide (Shewry
and Hey, 2015). In India only three types of wheat are
produced that is bread, durum and dicoccum due to different
food habits and environmental conditions.
Consumption of a mixture of different flours which
provide nutrients from natural sources is gaining popularity.
Multigrain food items constitute a combination of flours of
many grains such as wheat, oat, barley, maize, millets, rice,
flax etc. Such flours make a positive contribution to the
nutritive value taste and texture of products. They help in
making the digestive system healthier, control weight,

Utilization of the Whole Cowpea Pod and Barley Husk in The Production of Nutritionally Enriched Composite Flour
decrease the chances of diabetes and cardio vascular
diseases and prevent cases of bowel cancer Malik et al. (2015).
Non communicable diseases are becoming a major
concern now a days. To prevent these diseases, fundamental
transformation in food systems is needed so that qualitative,
nutritious and affordable diets are available worldwide.
Therefore, the present study was planned to formulate,  a
fibre and protein rich whole cowpea pod and barley husk
enriched composite flour.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The investigation was conducted in the Department of Foods
and Nutrition, College of Home Science, G.B. Pant University
of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar, Uttarakhand. The
purpose of the research was to develop whole cowpea pod
and barley husk enriched composite flour for health benefits.
After review of high fibre foods available in the region,
cowpea, barley husk and wheat flour were selected for the
development of the composite flour. The final ratios of the
three different flours were determined through sensory
evaluation. For the preparation of composite flour, whole
cowpea pod flour and barley husk flour were mixed in the
ratio of 1:1. The whole wheat flour and the above mixture
were then mixed in the ratio of 8:2. The prepared flour was
stored in plastic air tight containers of 5 kg.  All the nutritional
estimations were determined in triplicates. Proximate
composition comprising of moisture, crude protein, total ash
and crude fat was analyzed by AOAC (1995) standard
method. Total carbohydrate was calculated by subtracting
the sum of percentage of protein, fat, ash and moisture from
100. Physiological energy value was calculated by
multiplying the amount of protein, fat and carbohydrate per
100 gram of food sample by 4,9 and 4 respectively and
summing up the three values. For mineral estimation, ash
solution was prepared by method of Raghuramulu et al.
(2003). Phosphorus was estimated colorimetrically
according to the method of Fiske and Subba Rao (1925)
described by Ranganna (1991). The calcium content was
determined using the AOAC. (1970) titrimetric method,
whereas the magnesium content was assessed using the
Gravimetric method. Wong’s approach, cited by
Raghuramulu et al., 2003 was used to determine iron
colorimetrically. Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS)
method was used to determine manganese. Total dietary
fibre was estimated by the method prescribed by AOAC
(1995). Antinutrients comprising of phytic acid and tannins
were analyzed according to the method of Wheeler and
Ferrel (1971) and Folin-denis method given by Schanderl
(1970). For antioxidant analysis, the sample was prepared
by the method prescribed by Bhatt and Patel (2013).
Flavonoids content was determined by using Aluminium
Chloride Spectrophotometric Method (Zhishen et al., 1999)
while Folin Ciocalteu Spectrophotometric method was used
to estimate total phenolic content (Singleton et al., 1999).
The shelf life of the flour was also evaluated. Storage
study was done for 90 days for which the flour was packed
in 12 pouches. For packaging 6 aluminium laminated
pouches of dimension-18.5  13  0.2 cm, capacity-313 g
and 6 polythene pouches of 125 microns, 492.1 gauge and
capacity 1 kg were used and stored at room temperature.
One pouch of each packaging was opened fortnightly for
estimations. The storage quality evaluation was done on
the basis of sensory evaluation, moisture content, reducing
sugars, free fatty acids, peroxide value and total bacterial
count. For sensory evaluation, chapatti was prepared. Two
scales were used for organoleptic evaluation that is Nine
Point Hedonic Scale and Score Card (Amerine et al., 1965).
A Semi trained panel consisting of 30 members (Aggarwal
and Premchand, 2008) from the Department of Foods and
Nutrition did the sensory evaluation. Moisture was estimated
by the procedure as used in proximate composition. Free
fatty acid and peroxide value was determined by AOAC 2000
method. Nelson-Somogyi (Somogyi 1952) method was used
to estimate reducing sugars. Total bacterial count was
determined using standard plate count (SPC) technique
(APHA, 1992).
Statistical design
The objective of the statistiical analysis was to identify
significant or non- significant difference in the nutrient
content and storage period of the composite flour and barley
husk. For nutritional content, storage study and sensory
evaluation all estimations were done in triplicate and mean
± SD was calculated. One way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
was used as the analytical tool for comparison of mean
nutrient content for 3 treatments (3 different types of
composite flour mix made with different proportion of cowpea
pod powder, barley husk and whole wheat flour) as well as
barly husk.
Nutritive value of the composite flour was also compared
with the values of wheat flour reported in literature.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Development of composite flour
Three combinations of whole cowpea pod, barley husk and
wheat flour were tried for the development of composite flour.
Of the  3 developed flours, flour having 20% incorporation
of barley husk powder and cowpea pod powder (1:1 ratio)
was selected for further study due to its high sensory quality.
(Table 1 and 2).
Proximate composition
Table 3 shows the proximate composition of the selected
composite flour and barley husk. The composite flour was
found to have lower moisture content when compared with
the values reported by Bhatt and Gupta (2015) that is 12.5
per cent. Whereas barley husk had higher moisture content
in comparison to that one found by Biswas et al. (2017). In
comparison to the current study, Jothilakshmi et al. (2016)
observed the total ash content to be lower (1.7 g) and crude
protein to be higher (15.15 g) in multigrain mix as compared
to the total ash and crude protein content of composite flour
in the study. Garrote et al. (2008) estimated ash and protein

content in barley husk. The ash content was found to be
19.81 per cent which was higher than the ash content in the
current study. The crude protein in wheat husk was 6 per
cent according to the study of Bledzki et al. (2009) which
was found to be lower while the crude fat was higher than
that reported in the present study. Similar results were found
by Bhatt and Gupta (2015) in their study on composite flour.
When compared with the study of Malshe et al. (2014), the
crude fibre content in composite flour was found to be same
whereas physiological energy was observed to be higher.
In contrast, Ekwe (2013) found higher crude fibre content in
rice husk as compared with the fibre content of barley husk
in the present study. Carbohydrate in composite flour
evaluated by Itagi and Singh (2012) was found to be higher
than the results obtained in the present study Ekwe (2013)
observed a lower physiological energy and carbohydrates
content in rice husk in comparison to the results of barley
husk in the present study.

Utilization of the Whole Cowpea Pod and Barley Husk in The Production of Nutritionally Enriched Composite Flour
(2017) the phosphorus content of composite flour was
higher in comparison to the results of present study. The
iron content in composite flour and barley husk was found
to be higher when compared with the results of Tangariya
et al. (2018) and Raheem and Kareem (2017) respectively.
The magnesium, calcium and manganese content in
composite flour was found to be lower in comparison to
the study of Bhatt and Gupta (2015), Tangariya et al. (2018)
and Yuvarani et al. (2016). The  phosphorus, magnesium,
calcium and iron values were found to be higher in barley
husk, when compared with the results of Raheem and
Kareem (2017), Hashim et al. (1996), Slither (2008) and
Korotkova et al. (2016).
Table 5 shows the total dietary fibre content of
composite flour and barley husk. The total dietary fibre in
multigrain flour prepared by Pande et al. (2017) was found
to be similar as reported in the current study that is 21.89
per cent. Fadaei and Salehifar (2012) found higher value
of dietary fibre in rice husk (44.66g) than that of barley
husk evaluated in this study.
Antinutrients
The results showed that the phytic acid content of composite
flour (191.05 mg) differs significantly from that of barley husk
(3.66 mg) Parmar and Dahiya (2013) analyzed  the phytic
acid in  wheat flour ( between 167.18 to 241.63 mg), which
was similar to the result of the present study. Perea et al.
(2019) measured the phytic acid level in barley husk and
found it to be 2.32 mg, which was higher than the value
reported in this study. Tannins content of composite flour
was 2.38 mg whereas in barley husk, it was found to be
5.04 mg. Bhatt and Gupta (2015) analyzed the tannin content
of composite flour in their study which was 0.159 per cent
and was lower than the result of present study. Chikwendu
et al. (2014), studied the tannin content in cowpea husk
(3.05 mg) which was lower than that of barley husk in the
study (Table 6).
Antioxidants
Total phenolic content of composite flour and barley husk
was 438.44 mg of GAE/g and 302.84 mg of GAE/g
respectively. The difference between the two was significant.
When compared to the study of Tangariya et al. (2018) the
total phenolic content (549.70 mg of GAE/g) was higher than
that reported in current study. However total phenolic
concentration in barley husk was similar to that of Perea
et al. (2019). Total flavonoid content in composite flour and
barley husk was 24.55 mg of RE/g and 35.08 mg of RE/g
respectively. The values differed significantly. Total flavonoid
content of composite flour was higher than that reported in
the study of Bhatt and Gupta (2015) i.e 48 µgQE/mg.  The
total flavonoid content of barley husk was higher than that
reported by Perea et al. (2019) (Table 7).
Storage stability of composite flour
The study revealed that both the packaging materials are
shelf stable up to 90 days. However, laminated aluminum
pouches gave better results.
Statistical analysis revealed significant difference
between composite flour and barley husk in overall nutritional
estimations.
CONCLUSION
The composite flour developed under the present research
had superior nutritional quality since it contained a significant
quantity of protein, energy, total dietary fibre, calcium and
antioxidants as compared to wheat flour. The nutritional
potential of the developed flour has been enhanced due to
the incorporation of whole cow pea pod and barley husk.
Barley husk too was found to be a good functional food with
high fibre, ash and manganese content. Laminated
aluminum pouches gave better results thus were found to
be a better option for packaging. The study has established
the use of the entire pod of cowpea and barley husk for
