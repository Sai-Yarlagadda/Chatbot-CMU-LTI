Abstract
Background The US-Mexico border is the busiest in the world, with millions of people crossing it daily. However, little 
is known about cross-border utilization of cancer care, or about the reasons driving it. We designed a cross sectional 
online survey to understand the type of care patients with cancer who live in the US and Mexico seek outside their 
home country, the reasons why patients traveled across the border to receive care, and the barriers faced when 
seeking cross-border care.
Results The online survey was sent to the 248 cancer care providers working in the six Mexican border states who 
were registered members of the Mexican Society of Oncology. Responses were collected between September-
November 2022. Sixty-six providers (response rate 26%) completed the survey. Fifty-nine (89%) reported interacting 
with US-based patients traveling to Mexico to receive various treatment modalities, with curative surgery (n = 38) 
and adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 31) being the most common. Forty-nine (74%) reported interacting with Mexico-
based patients traveling to the US to receive various treatment modalities, with immunotherapy (n = 29) and curative 
surgery (n = 27) being the most common. The most frequently reported reason US-based patients sought care in 
Mexico was inadequate health insurance (n = 45). The most frequently reported reason Mexico-based patients sought 
care in the US was patients’ perception of superior healthcare (n = 38).
Conclusions Most Mexican oncologists working along the Mexico-US border have interacted with patients seeking 
or receiving binational cancer care. The type of care sought, as well as the reasons for seeking it, differ between US 
and Mexico-based patients. These patterns of cross-border healthcare utilization highlight unmet needs for patients 
with cancer in both countries and call for policy changes to improve outcomes in border regions.

Background
The United States (US) and Mexico share a 1,954-mile 
border which is crossed by over 200 million people every 
year, making it the busiest in the world. Estimates of 
how many people cross the border specifically to receive 
healthcare vary, but data from one analysis suggested 
that 4.5 million people traveled to Mexico for healthcare 
in the year 2007 alone [1]. In 2014, individuals traveling 
to Mexico to receive healthcare generated an estimated 
$3.1  billion US dollars in revenue [2]. Most US-based 
individuals who travel to Mexico to receive healthcare 
are US citizens who are first or second-generation Mexi-
can immigrants, live in close geographic proximity to 
the border, and travel to Mexican cities near the border 
[3–5]. Common reasons why these individuals cross the 
border to get medical care include lack of health insur-
ance making them unable to afford healthcare in the US, 
limited English proficiency, and a perception that care in 
Mexico may be more aligned with their cultural beliefs 
[1, 4–9]. Less is known about the reasons why patients 
travel from Mexico to the US for healthcare.
A major obstacle to quality cancer care in Mexico 
is limited availability and access to procedures, thera-
pies, and diagnostic tests, with many patients unable to 
receive treatment and consequently experiencing worse 
outcomes [10–13]. Likewise, many underserved patients 
with cancer who live in the US have similar issues access-
ing care, primarily related to cost [14, 15].
Data pertaining to how and why patients with cancer 
who live in the US and Mexico travel across the border to 
receive care explicitly related to their cancer are limited. 
The objective of this work was to understand, according 
to Mexican oncologists practicing in border states, the 
reasons patients with cancer in the US and Mexico seek 
care outside their home country and, for those patients 
who do, what barriers they face.
Methods
We administered a cross-sectional online survey to Mexi-
can oncologists practicing in Mexican border states (Baja 
California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, Sonora, 
and Tamaulipas), identified from the Mexican Society 
of Oncology’s (SMEO) member directory. The study 
is reported in accordance with the Consensus-Based 
Checklist for Reporting Survey Studies (CROSS) [16].
The Spanish-language survey (Appendix 1) was created 
by a group of Mexican and US oncologists and included 
42 questions divided in three sections, dealing with (1) 
demographic information; (2) patients from the US seek-
ing cancer care in Mexico; and (3) patients from Mexico 
seeking cancer care in the US. The survey was pretested 
among Spanish-speaking oncology fellows to assess the 
clarity of the questions. The target population were the 
248 members of SMEO (surgeons, medical oncologists, 
radiation oncologists, gynecologist oncologists, patholo-
gists, and pediatric oncologists) working in the six Mexi-
can border states.
The survey was administered through REDCap 
between October and November 2022. An initial email 
advertising the survey and four weekly reminders were 
sent to potential respondents from the SMEO email 
account. Participant responses were anonymized and 
the IRB of Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y 
Nutrición Salvador Zubirán approved the study.
Descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze the study 
population and responses to the survey. Due to the sur-
vey’s characteristics, missing values were not possible. 
Weighing of items, use of propensity scores, or sensi-
tivity analyses were not performed. Statistical analyses 
were performed utilizing StataCorp. 2021. Stata Statisti-

Results
Respondent demographics
Sixty-six respondents began and completed the survey, 
corresponding to a response rate of 26.6%. Respondents 
identified as medical oncologists (n = 25), surgical oncol-
ogists (n = 24), gynecologic oncologists (n = 7), radiation 
oncologists (n = 6), pediatric oncologists (n = 2), palliative 
care specialists (n = 1), and hematologists (n = 1). Most 
respondents practiced in Baja California (n = 21) followed 
by Nuevo León (n = 14), Chihuahua (11), Sonora (n = 9), 
Tamaulipas (n = 6), and Coahuila (n = 5).
Types of therapies, imaging, and tests patients sought 
outside their Home Country
Sixty (91%) respondents interacted with US-based 
patients who traveled to Mexico for care within the past 
five years, with 19 reporting interacting with ≥ 10. Fifty-
nine (89%) interacted with US-based patients traveling 
to Mexico to receive various treatment modalities, with 
curative surgery (n = 38) and adjuvant chemotherapy 
(n = 31) being the most common. Seven (12%) inter-
acted with US-based patients traveling to Mexico seek-
ing non-approved therapies, including homeopathic and 
alternative treatments. Thirty-one (47%) interacted with 
US-based patients who traveled to Mexico to buy can-
cer medications, with oral chemotherapy (n = 23), oral 
hormone therapy (n = 19), and opioid analgesics (n = 17) 
being the most common (Table  1). Forty-six (69.7%) 
interacted with US-based patients traveling to Mexico for 
imaging, including computed tomography (CT) (n = 38), 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n = 33), and nuclear 
imaging (n = 32). Thirty-seven (56%) interacted with US-
based patients traveling to Mexico for diagnostic tests 
such as biopsies (n = 34), bloodwork (n = 21), and tumor 
markers (n = 21) (Table 2).

Forty-nine (74%) respondents interacted with Mexico-
based patients traveling to the US for treatment, with 
immunotherapy (n = 29) and curative surgery (n = 27) 
being the most common. Twenty (30%) interacted with 
Mexico-based patients traveling to the US to buy can-
cer medications, with oral chemotherapy (n = 12) and 
hormonal therapy (n = 9) being the most common. Five 
interacted with patients seeking CAR-T therapy in the 
US, which is not currently available in Mexico (Table 1). 
Twenty-six (39%) interacted with Mexico-based patients 
traveling to the US for imaging, including nuclear imag-
ing (n = 21), CT (n = 10), and MRI (n = 10). Twenty-three 
(35%) interacted with Mexico-based patients traveling to 
the US to for diagnostic tests, the most common being 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) (n = 20) (Table 2).
Reasons patients pursued Cancer Care outside thier Home 
Country
The main reason US-based patients sought care in Mex-
ico was inadequate health insurance (n = 45) (Fig. 1). Out 
of pocket expenses were reported as the main reason why 
US-based patients traveled to Mexico to buy medications 
(n = 26), undergo imaging studies (n = 37) and get labora-
tory tests (n = 30) (Table 3).
The main reason Mexico-based patients sought care in 
the US was patients’ perception of superior healthcare 
(n = 38) (Fig. 1). Lack of availability was reported as the 
main reason why Mexico-based patients traveled to the 
US to buy medications (n = 15) and to undergo imaging 
studies (n = 15), while the most common reason for trav-
eling to get laboratory tests was a perception of higher 
quality testing in the US (n = 14) (Table 3).
Barriers to receiving Care outside of the patients’ home 
country
Twenty-nine (44%) respondents interacted with US-
based patients who wanted to receive care in Mexico 
but could not, mostly due to lack of financial resources 
(n = 17). Forty-three (65%) interacted with Mexico-
based patients who wanted to receive care in the US but 
could not, which was also mostly due to limited financial 
resources (n = 43) (Fig. 2).
Discussion
This study represents a comprehensive record of can-
cer care utilization across the US-Mexico border, with 
information obtained from cancer care providers work-
ing in Mexican border states. Our results show that the 
scope of cancer care utilization outside of patients’ home 
countries is considerable, and mostly driven by financial 
issues, availability of tests and medications, and a percep-
tion of superior care abroad [4, 7, 8, 17]. Our findings are 
consistent with prior studies of bidirectional healthcare 
utilization in the US and Mexico, particularly concerning 
the limited accessibility of certain therapies and recently 
developed diagnostic tests, such as CAR-T or NGS.
Although efforts have been made to provide universal 
access for cancer care in Mexico, many patients are still 
required to pay for medications and other healthcare 
expenses, which may sometimes be unaffordable. In an 
analysis of National Health and Nutrition Survey data, 
over 17% of beneficiaries of public healthcare systems 
could not obtain prescribed medications [18]. Since 2020, 
the National Fund for Wellbeing (FONSABI) has over-
seen financing catastrophic health expenses, such as can-
cer care, although the supply of medications and access 
to many interventions has been inconsistent since its 
inception [19, 20]. The limited availability of cancer drugs 
in Mexico is highlighted by the fact that the average avail-
ability of essential cancer medicines (as defined by the

World Health Organization) covered by Mexican public 
health insurance is of approximately 60% [21, 22].
US-based patients who traveled to Mexico were more 
likely to be seeking chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, 
which may be due to the lower cost of these treatments 
in Mexico. In contrast, Mexico-based patients traveled to 
the US to obtain therapies which are either unavailable 
or not covered in Mexico such as immunotherapy, stem 
cell transplantation, and cellular therapy [23, 24]. Inter-
estingly, US-based patients traveled to Mexico often to 
undergo imaging and other diagnostic tests, which may 
be due to their affordability and accessibility, particularly 
for patients with limited health insurance. Mexico-based 
patients traveled to the US to receive more novel tests, 
such as NGS or nuclear medicine, which may be due to 
limited availability/coverage of such testing in Mexico 
[25].
The most common reason reported for US-based 
patients traveling to Mexico was inadequate health insur-
ance coverage. Disruptions in health insurance coverage 
are common among patients undergoing cancer treat-
ment in the US and are associated with worse survival 
[26]. Delays and denial of medical care due to health 
insurance review, also known as prior authorization, have 
also resulted in a significant adverse impact on treat-
ment initiation, receipt of diagnostic imaging, and out-
of-pocket expenses in patients with cancer [27]. These 
issues likely lead some patients in the US to seek care in 
Mexico. Other reasons why US-based patients traveled to 
Mexico included access to alternative therapies, language

barriers in the US, and availability of a more robust social 
support system in Mexico. These findings correspond to 
previous reports highlighting the use of alternative medi-
cine as a major driver for individuals in the US seeking 
care in Mexico [28]. Conversely, Mexico-based patients 
traveled to the US primarily due to patients’ perception 
that cancer care was of higher quality in the US and that 
medications, imaging studies, and other diagnostic tests 
were unavailable in Mexico. Overall, fewer respondents 
reported interacting with Mexico-based patients who 
traveled to the US to buy medications, undergo imaging, 
and receive diagnostic tests than the number of respon-
dents who reported interacting with US-based patients 
who traveled to Mexico for these services, which most 
likely is due to financial issues.
Lack of financial resources was the most common lim-
iting factor among patients who wanted to go across the 
border to receive care but could not. The cost associated 
with traveling, lodging, and reduced income related to 
loss of employment from taking days off from work have 
been shown to impose significant financial hardship on 
patients with cancer in both the US and Mexico [29, 30]. 
A significant proportion of Mexico-based patients were 
unable to travel to the US to receive cancer care because 
of passport/visa issues and language barriers, while many 
US-based patients were unable to travel to Mexico to 
receive cancer care because of the absence of a support 
system in Mexico.
Our results may have implications for binational and 
cross-border policy. In Mexico, patients with cancer can 
receive care from institutions in the private or public sec-
tor. Patients who receive care at private pharmacies and 
health facilities typically contribute financially to private 
insurance companies and pay out-of-pocket expenses [31, 
32]. Patients treated at institutions in the public sector 
usually have social health insurance, which unfortunately 
may be limited due to medication shortages or access 
issues [31, 33]. In the US, patients with cancer typically 
receive care from National Cancer Institute (NCI) com-
prehensive cancer centers, NCI-designated cancer cen-
ters, or community cancer practices. Patients with cancer 
who lack health insurance in the US are more likely to be 
diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer at diagnosis and 
have worse survival after diagnosis [34–36]. People living 
in the US along the US-Mexico border have lower health 
insurance rates [37], with some reports estimating the 
percentage of uninsured individuals in border counties at 
nearly 50% [38, 39]. One proposed solution to providing 
care to undocumented immigrants, as well as to address 
the liberal utilization of healthcare in both the US and 
Mexico by people who lack health insurance, is a bina-
tional health insurance plan. Two such programs were 
“Salud Migrante” for uninsured Mexican immigrants and 
“Medicare in Mexico” for older Americans [40]. Theo-
retically, these programs would allow undocumented 
immigrants to travel to Mexico to receive care while their 
legal status is in flux and enable Americans eligible for 
Medicare to travel to Mexico for components of their 
healthcare, respectively. Ultimately, these programs were

hampered by legal and regulatory challenges and had to 
be discontinued.
The impact of bidirectional healthcare utilization by 
patients in the US and Mexico is clear in Mexican border 
cities, where more private (compared to public) primary 
care providers exist to serve patients from the US seek-
ing care in Mexico [41]. At a patient level, bidirectional 
healthcare utilization may also have a significant impact. 
Patients who travel outside their home country to receive 
care often receive concurrent treatment by providers in 
two sites, leading to duplication of diagnostic tests and 
treatments [42]. This phenomenon could theoretically 
result in increased healthcare costs and raises a mul-
titude of patient safety concerns. Further, the quality of 
healthcare provided along the Mexican border, particu-
larly concerning elective procedures, wellness services, 
and fertility expertise, has been called into question [2, 
43]. Risks such as lack of appropriate longitudinal care, 
the acquisition of multi-drug resistant organisms dur-
ing surgical procedures, and lack of standardized qual-
ity control measures have led to instances of significant 
morbidity and mortality in patients traveling to Mexico 
for these services [2].
A highly complex issue affecting cross-border care is 
the existence of legal barriers related to immigration, as 
highlighted by our study findings showing a significant 
proportion of patients saw passport/visa issues as a bar-
rier for getting care. Over 20 million noncitizens are cur-
rently living in the US, of which almost half are uninsured 
[44]. In the US, undocumented immigrants are ineligible 
to obtain federal health insurance offered by the Fed-
eral Health Insurance Market Place as a provision of the 
Affordable Care Act [45, 46]. Those seeking asylum in the 
US are eligible for Medicaid or other forms of US-based 
public insurance, while qualified noncitizens can buy 
insurance coverage in the marketplace during their first 
five years in the country, becoming eligible for Medic-
aid after living in the US for five years. Undocumented 
immigrants do not qualify for these insurance plans and 
may be unlikely to travel to Mexico to receive health-
care while their legal status is uncertain [1, 44, 46]. The 
Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act requires 
the provision of healthcare to patients in the emergency 
department regardless of a patient’s ability to pay. How-
ever, these services are only funded for Medicaid-eligible 
patients through the federally funded Emergency Med-
icaid program, and some border states, such as Texas, 
have policies restricting Medicaid eligibility [47]. On the 
other hand, California plans to expand Medicaid cover-
age to all residents older than 26 with a certain income 
by 2024. Notably, costs associated with providing care 
to US-based noncitizens are lower than those associated 
with providing care to citizens [48].
Tracking cancer incidence and mortality in the US-
Mexico border region is challenging, partly because 
patients travel across the border to receive care. Some 
have proposed that lower cancer-related mortality rates 
among the Hispanic population in the US are due to the 
so-called “salmon-bias” effect, which purports patients 
return to their country of origin when they receive a 
terminal diagnosis [49–52]. As a result, these patients’ 
deaths may not be captured in national registries, result-
ing in an inaccurate registered mortality rate.
Our study has limitations. Firstly, the information 
collected from respondents was based on recall rather 
than prospectively collected data, which highlights the 
potential for recall bias on the part of respondents. This 
highlights a potential opportunity to gather pertinent 
information on patients with cancer who travel interna-
tionally to receive care. Secondly, oncologists’ perspec-
tives on why patients traveled outside their home country 
to receive cancer care may have been assumed. It is plau-
sible that asking patients themselves may have yielded 
different results. Further, the relatively small sample size 
of respondents may not accurately capture the entirety of 
perspectives of practicing oncologists in Mexican border 
states. Lastly, the descriptive nature of our study make 
drawing statistically significant differences between the 
reasons US-based and Mexico-based patients traveled 
to receive care and the type of therapies and studies they 
received and underwent difficult. However, since SMEO 
is the largest organization in Mexico, we believe we were 
able to target most oncology professionals in the border 
area, and the proportion of responses is standard for an 
online survey.
Conclusions
According to Mexican oncologists, US-based patients 
travel to Mexico to receive cancer care primarily due to 
inadequate health insurance and excessive out of pocket 
expenses in the US. In contrast, Mexico-based patients 
travel to the US to receive cancer care due to patients’ 
perception that cancer care in the US is of higher qual-
ity and because diagnostic or therapeutic components of 
their care are unavailable in Mexico. Further, the type of 
care and therapies patients seek outside their home coun-
try differs, with US-based patients traveling to Mexico 
primarily to undergo imaging studies, biopsies, surgery, 
and chemotherapy; and Mexico-based patients traveled 
to the US to receive advanced laboratory tests (such as 
NGS), immunotherapy, and surgery.
These patterns of cross-border healthcare utilization 
highlight unmet needs for patients with cancer in the US 
and Mexico and are consistent with those identified by 
others who seek to determine why patients with cancer 
travel outside of their home country for care and what 
challenges these patients face [53]. In the US, considering

the preferences and healthcare-related issues afflicting 
patients with cancer is essential when formulating and 
adopting policies related to improving access to cultur-
ally competent care. In Mexico, improving access, both in 
terms of affordability and availability within the Mexican 
healthcare system, must be addressed to provide higher-
quality care.
