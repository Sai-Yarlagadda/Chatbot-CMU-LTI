Abstract 
Background Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) is an essential enzyme catalyzing trehalose synthesis, 
an important regulatory factor for plant development and stress response in higher plants. However, the TPP gene 
family in soybean has not been reported.
Results A comprehensive analysis of the TPP gene family identified 18 GmTPPs classified into eight groups based 
on the phylogenetic relationships and the conservation of protein in six monocot and eudicot plants. The closely 
linked subfamilies had similar motifs and intron/exon numbers. Segmental duplication was the main driving force 
of soybean GmTPPs expansion. In addition, analysis of the cis-regulatory elements and promoter regions of GmT-
PPs revealed that GmTPPs regulated the response to several abiotic stresses. Moreover, RNA-seq and qRT-PCR 
analysis of the tissue-specific GmTPPs under different abiotic stresses revealed that most GmTPPs were associated 
with response to different stresses, including cold, drought, saline-alkali, and exogenous trehalose. Notably, exoge-
nous trehalose treatment up-regulated the expression of most TPP genes under saline-alkali conditions while increas-
ing the carbohydrate and trehalose levels and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in soybean 
sprouts, especially in the saline-alkali tolerant genotype. Furthermore, the interaction network and miRNA target 
prediction revealed that GmTPPs interacted with abiotic stress response-related transcription factors.
Conclusions The findings in this study lay a foundation for further functional studies on TPP-based breeding 
to improve soybean development and stress tolerance.

Background
Trehalose, a non-reducing disaccharide composed of two 
α- glucose molecules, is widely found in bacteria, yeast, 
invertebrates, protozoa, and higher plants [1–3]. It serves 
as an energy source during intracellular metabolism and 
also acts as a signaling molecule that regulates pathways 
involved in energy metabolism [4]. In plants, stress toler-
ance is significantly improved by regulating sugar accu-
mulation, modulating the activity of sugar transporters, 
and sugar metabolism [5]. Trehalose accumulation is 
observed in many plant species under various abiotic 
stress conditions such as high and low temperatures, 
drought, salt, and high osmotic pressure. This accumula-
tion is believed to have important evolutionary roles in 
protecting cellular structuresand biologically active sub-
stances like nucleic acids, membranes, and proteins [6]. 
However, plant response to abiotic stress is complex, 
involving many physiological and biochemical processes 
and molecular mechanisms, such as the differential 
expression of stress-related genes in various pathways [7].
The synthesis of trehalose in plants follows a highly 
conserved pathway that involves two enzymes. First, 
trehalose 6-phosphate synthase (TPS) catalyzes the 
synthesis of trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) from uridine 
diphosphate-glucose and glucose 6-phosphate. Sub-
sequently, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) 
dephosphorylates T6P to produce trehalose [8, 9]. In 
addition, TPP acts as a signaling molecule that regulates 
important metabolic and developmental processes in 
plants. For example, TPP inhibits the activity of sucrose 
nonfermenting-related kinase1, crucial in the transcrip-
tional regulatory network under stress conditions and 
energy metabolism [10].
Members of the TPP genes family encode TPP 
enzymes, and with the advant of genome sequencing 
technology, an increasing number of TPP gene fam-
ily members have been identified in various plants. For 
example, 10 TPP gene family members (AtTPPA-G) have 
been identified in Arabidopsis [11], 13 (OsTPP1-13) in 
rice (Oryza sativa) [12], 79 (GaTPP1-17, GrTPP1-12, 
GbTPP1-26, Gh1-24) in cotton (Gossypium spp) [13], and 
11 (ZmTPPA1.1–1.2, Zm TPPB1.1–1.6, ZmTPPB2.1–2.2) 
in maize (Zea mays) [14]. The TPP structure is highly 
conserved in plants, with specific structural domains 
containing only phosphatase domains. Furthermore, 
while TPP gene family members exhibit similar enzy-
matic activities, they display different patterns of differ-
ential expression, suggesting their involvement in specific 
tissues, stages, or processes [15].
Several TPP genes have been implicated in plant 
responses to abiotic stresses. Specifically, the overexpres-
sion or mutation of certain TPP genes has been shown 
to significantly impact plant growth, development, and 
tolerance to abiotic stress. For example, a mutation in the 
maize RAMOSA3 TPP gene has been linked to extensive 
inflorescence branching [16]. Similarly, the overexpres-
sion of AtTPPI or AtTPPF has been found to enhanced 
drought tolerance in Arabidopsis [17, 18]. In addition, 
the overexpression of AtTPPD, the only TPP family gene 
related to salt stress in Arabidopsis, which regulates sugar 
metabolism under salt stress, led to a significant accu-
mulation of starch and soluble sugar [15]. In rice, the 
overexpression of OsTPP1 or OsTPP3 has been found 
to enhance tolerance to both salt and drought stresses 
[19, 20]. Additionally, the overexpression of Mads6, 
a promoter driving OsTPP1 expression in maize, has 
been shown to significantly improves maize yield under 
drought conditions [21].
Soybean (Glycine max) is an economically important 
crop due to its high protein content and edible oil. How-
ever, soybean is susceptible to various abiotic stresses, 
which can negatively impacttheir growth and reduce 
crop productivity [22, 23]. Currently,, there is no research 
on TPP genes in soybean. In this study, we aimed to iden-
tify, describ, and phylogenetically classified 18 putative 
TPP genes in soybean. In addition, we also analyzed their 
gene structure, motifs, conserved structures, replication 
patterns, interaction networks, tissue-specific expression 
patterns, and cis-elements. Furthermore, we investigated 
the expression patterns of GmTPPs under abiotic stresses 
using RNA-seq and Real-time quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Additionally,, we analyzed the 
tissue-specific expression of GmTPPs and examined the 
effects of exogenous trehalose treatment on saline-alkali 
tolerance of soybean sprouts. This comprehensive analy-
sis of the GmTPP gene family will serve as a foundation 
for further studies on their functions in soybean.
Results
Genome‑wide identification and fundamental analysis 
of GmTPP genes
BLASTp search of the GmTPP gene members using 10 
Arabidopsis protein sequences as the query identified 
18 putative TPP genes in the soybean genome (Addi-
tional file 2: Table S1). The 18 TPP genes in the reference 
soybean genome (Glycine max Wm82.a2. v1) were con-
firmed by the combined Pfam (Trehalose_PPase; Pfam: 
PF02358), CDD-search, and HMMER analysis. Subse-
quently, they were labeled GmTPP1 – GmTPP18 accord-
ing to their orders on the chromosomes. The physical 
and chemical properties of these genes are indicated in 
Table  1. The GmTPP protein lengths ranged from 214 
to 392 aa with molecular weights of 24.24 (GmTPP11) 
to 43.43 (GmTPP7) kDa. In addition, their theoreti-
cal isoelectric point ranged from 5.51 (GmTPP16) to 
9.78 (GmTPP8). GRAVY was predicted to be -0.518

(GmTPP17) to -0.027 (GmTPP11), implying that these 
proteins were hydrophilic. Finally, subcellular localiza-
tion prediction revealed that the GmTPPs were localized 
in the vacuole and chloroplast.
Chromosome distribution and phylogenetic analysis 
of GmTPP genes in soybean
The chromosome maps based on the genomic sequences 
revealed the genomic distribution of GmTPPs on soybean 
chromosomes (Fig. 1a). The maps revealed that the TPP 
family members were evenly distributed on 13 chromo-
somes in the soybean genome.
Phylogenetic analysis based on the 87 TPP protein 
sequences from six plant species, including monocoty-
ledonous angiosperms, wheat (Triticum aestivum), rice 
and maize, and the dicotyledonous angiosperms, Arabi-
dopsis, tomato and soybean categorized the TPPs into 
eight subfamilies (I-VIII) (Fig.  1b; (Additional file  3: 
Table  S2)). Subfamily III was comprised of TPP genes 
from the six plant species, while subfamily V comprised 
only TPP genes from the dicotyledonous angiosperms. 
Subfamilies I, II, VII, and VIII comprised TPP genes from 
different monocotyledonous angiosperms species, while 
subfamily VI had three TPP genes from Arabidopsis and 
one from tomato. The phylogenetic analysis revealed five, 
three, and ten GmTPPs in the subfamilies III, IV, and 
V, respectively. Most of the soybean TPP proteins were 
closed related to those of Arabidopsis and tomato. This 
implies that the differentiation of TPP genes in dicotyle-
donous angiosperms occurred later than in monocotyle-
donous angiosperms.
GmTPPs conserved motif, gene structure, and domain 
analysis
Domain analysis of the 18 full-length GmTPP protein 
sequences divided these proteins into three separate sub-
families (Fig. 2a). Motifs 3 and 4 were present in all the 18 
GmTPPs proteins, implying that the two domains were 
highly conserved in TPP genes (Fig. 2a). Motifs 1, 2, 5, 
6, and 8 existed simultaneously in sisteen GmTPP mem-
bers, while Motifs 9 and 10 existed only in four GmTPP 
members. Overall, motifs 1–8 were present in most 
members. The conserved sequences of motifs 1–10 are 
shown in Fig. 2b.
Gene structure analysis revealed that GmTPP exons 
ranged from 9 to 11 and introns from 8 to 11, with genes 
clustered together having similar structures (Fig.  2c). 
GmTPP genes in the same subfamily had similar gene 
structures (intron number and exon length), particu-
larly those of subfamily V, which had 11 introns in soy-
bean. GmTPP6 had the longest gene length, implying a 
different evolution pattern with variant characteristics. 
Furthermore, the Pfam analysis revealed that all the 
GmTPP proteins contained a specific Trehalose PPase 
domain (PF02358). In addition, GmTPP5, GmTPP14, and 
GmTPP15 proteins in subfamily II had a transmembrane

region (Fig.  2d). The 18 proteins also had similar 3D 
structures (Additional file  1: Fig S1). The 3D structure 
of these proteins lays the foundation for their biological 
function.
Gene duplication and homology analysis of TPP genes
The evolutionary mechanism of the soybean TPP fam-
ily was revealed based on the collinear relationships of 
the TPP gene family in dicots (soybean, Arabidopsis, 
tomato) and monocots (wheat, rice, and maize) (Fig. 3). 
Among the 18 GmTPP genes, 14 possible pairs of dupli-
cated genes existed (Fig.  3a). Based on the gene rep-
etition analysis, all the identified paralogous genes were 
segmental duplications (SD), implying that SD was the 
main expansion mechanism of the GmTPP gene family. 
The ratio of the non-synonymous mutation rate (Ka) to 
the synonymous mutation rate (Ks) was used to express 
the selection pressure analysis of coding sequences, with 
Ka/Ks < 1 indicating purified/negative selection and Ka/
Ks > 1 Darwinian/positive selection. The Ka/Ks ratio 
ranged from 0.0109503 to 0.1057524, implying that puri-
fying selection was important during gene replication 
(Additional file 4: Table S3). These findings suggest that 
fragment replication events had important effects on the 
diversity of TPP genes in soybean.
Furthermore, homology analysis revealed that seven 
GmTPPs and five AtTPPs were orthologous gene 
pairs, resulting in 13 syntenic relationships. GmTPP5, 
GmTPP14, and GmTPP15 were collinear with AtTPPD, 
while GmTPP10 was collinear with AtTPPE, imply-
ing that they may have similar functions.The GmTPPs 
were collinear with 26 relationships in tomato, while 
nine GmTPP genes were collinear with 33 relation-
ships in wheat. In addition, two GmTPPs, two ZmTPPs, 
one GmTPPs, and one OsTPPs were orthologous gene 
pairs, resulting in syntenic relationships, respectively. 
The orthologous relationships between the soybean TPP 
genes and related genes from the six representative spe-
cies, including three dicots (Arabidopsis, soybean, and 
tomato) and three monocots (rice, maize, and wheat) are 
illustrated in Fig. 3b.
Promoter regions cis‑acting regulatory elements analysis
The CREs analysis identified 18 major CREs in the GmT-
PPs promoter sequence (Fig.  4a). The 18 major CREs 
were classified into four element categories, including 
phytohormones, cellular development, photoresponsive, 
and environmental stress (Additional file  5: Table  S4). 
Among them, the light-responsiveness CREs accounted 
for the largest proportion (44.4%), followed by the hor-
mone-regulated elements (such as auxin, abscisic acid,

gibberellins, salicylic acid, and methyl jasmonate), which 
accounted for 24.5%. The other two categories, including 
developmental and stress-related elements, accounted 
for 31.1% (Fig. 4b). The promoter regions of seven genes 
had low-temperature responsiveness elements, which 
contained all members of group III. In addition, there 
were nine genes involved in defense/stress, including four 
genes in group III (GmTPP2, GmTPP10, GmTPP13, and 
GmTPP17), two in group IV, and two in group V. Overall, 
genes in group III played an important role in defense/
stress response. The promoter regions of six genes also 
had drought induction elements, of which three were in 
group III and the other three were in group V. The CREs 
analysis revealed that GmTPPs respond to several hor-
mones and stresses, which may directly affect the stress 
response ability of GmTPPs under stress conditions. 
Among them, GmTPP2 and GmTPP15 were involved in 
response to several abiotic stress and hormones and the 
growth regulation of soybean.
Expression pattern of GmTPP genes in different tissues
The expression levels of GmTPPs in different tissues, 
including the flowers, stems, roots, nodules, shoots, 
leaves, pods, and seeds, were obtained from the Phyto-
zome database. The expression levels of GmTPPs in the 
soybean tissues were significantly different (Fig. 5a). For 
example, GmTPP4, GmTPP9, GmTPP14, and GmTPP15 
were up-regulated in the roots, and GmTPP13 in the 
leaves. In addition, the relative expression of GmTPP5, 
GmTPP7, GmTPP9, and GmTPP10 was also significantly 
higher in the leaves than in the other organs or tissues. 
GmTPP13 was also highly expressed in pods. In con-
trast, GmTPP6, GmTPP12, GmTPP16, GmTPP17, and 
GmTPP18 were lowly expressed in all the plant tissues.
qRT-PCR analysis of the expression patterns of the 18 
GmTPPs during the sprout stage revealed tissue-spe-
cific expression in soybean tissues (Fig. 5b). The expres-
sion pattern of 10 GmTPPs was detected in the soybean 
sprouts. GmTPP2, GmTPP7, GmTPP15, and GmTPP17 
in soybean radicles were highly expressed, with the high-
est expression level in GmTPP15. Besides, GmTPP4 and 
GmTPP6 expression levels in the soybean cotyledon 
were higher than in the radicle and hypocotyls. Simi-
larly, GmTPP7, GmTPP17, and GmTPP18 expression 
levels in the soybean hypocotyls were higher than in the 
radicle and cotyledon (Additional file  6: Fig S2). Taken 
together, GmTPPs expression in soybean is tissue-specific 
expressed during the sprout stage.
Expression profiles of GmTPP genes under abiotic stresses
qRT-PCR analysis on the soybean sprouts treated with 
4˚C, PEG, saline-alkali, and exogenous trehalose (T + SA) 
revealed the expression pattern of GmTPPs in response 
to abiotic stress (Fig. 6). Precisely, the expression levels of 
TPP family genes under the same treatment conditions 
were different. Besides, the expression patterns of the 
same genes under different treatment conditions differed.
The GmTPP6, GmTPP7, GmTPP13, GmTPP15, and 
GmTPP18 expression were induced under 4˚C and 
drought (PEG) treatments, with peak expression at 
72 h after treatment, implying that these genes are sen-
sitive to cold and drought stresses (Fig.  6ab). Except

for GmTPP6 and GmTPP7, the expression levels of all 
the other genes increased to more than 6 folds under 
saline-alkali stress (Fig.  6c). The expression levels of 
GmTPP13 and GmTPP15 were increased with the expo-
sure time to saline-alkali stress. GmTPP2, GmTPP5, 
GmTPP6, GmTPP7, GmTPP13, and GmTPP15 were also 
up-regulated under exogenous trehalose treatment com-
pared to under saline-alkali treatment (Fig. 6d). Moreo-
ver, GmTPP4 and GmTPP18 expression levels were 
decreased under exogenous trehalose treatment. At the 
same time, GmTPP2 and GmTPP5 responded only to 
saline-alkali and T + SA treatments, while GmTPP6 and

GmTPP7 were downregulated only under saline-alkali 
stress. In addition, GmTPP13 and GmTPP15 were signifi-
cantly up-regulated under the four abiotic stress condi-
tions. In summary, the GmTPP genes were responsive to 
abiotic stress, with most genes responding (up-regulated) 
to saline-alkali stress. In addition, gene expression was 
significantly increased after trehalose treatment, imply-
ing that trehalose could alleviate the damage caused by 
saline-alkali stress.
Validation of GmTPPs differential expression
The integrated transcriptome analysis revealed the GmT-
PPs expression patterns in the radicle of the different soy-
bean genotypes under saline-alkali stress (Fig.  7a). The 
raw data were submitted to the NCBI database. There 
was a significant difference in the expression of the two 
genotypes (N and K) GmTPPs genes under saline treat-
ment. GmTPP2, GmTPP5, GmTPP12, GmTPP14, and 
GmTPP15 were significantly up-regulated in the N 
genotype compared to K genotype. Among them, the 
expression levels of GmTPP2, GmTPP7, GmTPP12, 
and GmTPP15 were more than threefold. In contrast, 
GmTPP4, GmTPP6, GmTPP9, GmTPP10, and GmTPP13 
were down-regulated under saline-alkaline stress. Vali-
dation of the RNA-seq results by qRT-PCR analysis of 
the expression levels of the 18 GmTPP genes revealed 
that their expression levels had the same trend based on 
RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis, with an  R2 of 0.8931 
(Fig. 7b). Furthermore, Go enrichment and KEGG path-
way annotation analyses revealed that the starch and 
sucrose metabolism pathway was enriched. In particular, 
all the GmTPPs were enriched in the trehalose biosyn-
thetic process (Fig. 7c).
Exogenous trehalose in both genotypes 
and the expression of GmTPPs
To investigate the effect of trehalose on soybean response 
to saline-alkali stress, the N and K soybean genotypes 
were treated with 10 μmol/L trehalose and 160 mmol/L 
mixed saline-alkali solution consisting of NaCl,  Na2CO3, 
 NaHCO3, and  Na2SO4 (the molar ratio is 1:1:9:9) for 3 d, 
with the N and K soybean genotypes cultured in water 
serving as the control. The nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), 
diaminobenzidine (DAB) and TB staining revealed that 
the active, hydrogen peroxide  (H2O2) and superoxide 
anion  (O2
−) content in the ‘N’ genotype were greater than 
in the ‘K’ genotype under saline-alkali stress. In contrast, 
trehalose immersion resulted in a lower ROS accumula-
tion compared to the control and saline-alkali treatment 
(Fig. 8d-i).
The trehalose levels were increased under saline-
alkali stress, significantly increasing after trehalose

including low temperature (a), drought (b), SA (c) and T + SA (d). Low temperature treatment at 4 ◦C for 24 h and 72 h; untreat indicates control 
plants; PEG: drought treatment; SA: saline-alkali treatment; T + SA: trehalose immersion plus saline-alkali treatment. The expression levels of GmTPPs 
were analyzed using the  2−△△Ct methods

immersion. However, the trends of soluble sugar, glu-
cose, fructose, sucrose, and starch were inconsistent 
with trehalose levels (Fig.  8a-e). Under saline-alkali 
treatment alone, the soluble sugar, fructose, glucose, 
sucrose, and starch contents were decreased but 
increased under the T + SA treatment, especially in the 
saline-alkali tolerant genotype (N). Besides, the treha-
lose content under T + SA treatment was higher than 
under saline-alkali treatment (Fig.  8f). These results 
indicate that the energy metabolism of soybean was 
severely inhibited under saline-alkali stress but was 
alleviated by soaking in trehalose.
Interaction network analysis of GmTPPs and transcription 
factors and the prediction of miRNAs encoded by TPP 
family genes
Orthology-based prediction of the transcription fac-
tor- GmTPP genes interactions revealed that the GmTPP 
genes interacted with many transcription factors, includ-
ing NAC, MYB, bZIP, bHLH, ERF, and WRKY. GmTPP14 
and GmTPP15 homologous to AtTPPD interacted with 
COG, Dof, AGL, BPC, and AIL (Fig. 9a). GmTPP15 also 
interacted with multiple MYBs and one WRKY, while 
GmTPP14 also interacted with CAMTA. In addition, 
GmTPP5 interacted with multiple NACs and one WOX

and GmTPP2 with TCP and ARF. Some transcription 
factors also interacted with multiple genes. For example, 
MYB and AGL interacted with 13 GmTPPs, NAC with 
eight GmTPPss, and Dof with 14 GmTPPs.
The miRNAs are non-coding single-stranded RNA 
molecules with approximately 22 nucleotides in length. 
Encoded by endogenous genes, miRNAs regulate gene 
expression and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in 
plants. The prediction of the miRNA-targeting gene net-
works of TPP family genes in soybean (Fig. 9b) identified 
55 interaction relationships, including 33 miRNAs and 
14 TPP family genes. Among the genes, gma-miR1508b 
regulated the expression of four GmTPP genes, GmTPP1/ 
5/ 8 /15. In addition, GmTPP2, GmTPP7, GmTPP10, 
and GmTPP13 were targeted by the same miRNA 
(gma-miR5034). Seven miRNAs targeted GmTPP1, while 
GmTPP4 and GmTPP13 were each targeted by six miR-
NAs. Moreover, GMA-miR4379a, GMA-miR5038a, and 
gma-miR5038b regulated the expression of three TPP 
genes, GmTPP4/12/18, while gma-miR9758 and gma-
miR1508b regulated the expression of three other TPP 
genes, GmTPP5 /7 / 8.
Discussion
Trehalose plays a crucial role in plant growth, develop-
ment, and response to abiotic stresses [24]. In plants, 
trehalose is synthesized through the TPS-TPP meta-
bolic pathway, with T6P acting as an intermediate [25]. 
The TPP gene is a key regulator of trehalose synthe-
sis in plants, and its transcription and expression are

essential for mitigating plant damage caused by abiotic 
stress [26]. With the development of whole-genome 
sequencing, TPP gene have been identified in mono-
cots and dicots, including 10 in Arabidopsis [11], 11 in 
maize [14], 13 in rice [12], 30 in wheat [27], 8 in tomato 
[28], and 79 in cotton [29]. The number of GmTPP 
genes among the different plant species, indicating that 
the TPP gene family is not conserved. In this study, 
we identified 18 potential TPP genes in the soybean 
genome, distributed across its 13 soybean chromo-
somes. Phylogenetic analysis classified these genes into 
three subgroups, which showed similar motifs, gene 
structures, and CREs. Additionally, the 18 GmTPPs 
exhibitedtypical characteristics of the Trehalose_PPase 
domain.
Exon–intron diversity plays an important role in the 
evolution of gene families [30]. Therefore, gene function 
can be elucidated by analyzing the gene structure [18]. 
Generally, functionally similar genes have similar exon–
intron arrangements and protein structures [27]. In this 
study, the structure and number of exons and introns of 
GmTPP genes in the same subpopulation were similar, 
suggesting that genes in the same subpopulation might 
have similar functions. However, some differences were 
observed among subfamilies, possibly due to the evolu-
tionary diversification of gene functions.

Gene duplication is one of the major drivers of the 
genome and genetic system evolution. It plays an essen-
tial role in evolution by facilitating the generation of new 
genes and gene functions [31]. There are four main evo-
lutionary gene duplication events: whole genome dupli-
cation, tandem duplication, SD, and retro-transposition. 
Tandem and segmental duplications are the major gene 
replication events driving the plant gene family expansion 
[32]. Gene duplication events can leads to the emergence 
of novel functions [33]. In our analysis, we identified 14 
pairs of fragment duplicate GmTPP genes in the soybean 
genome, indicating the importance of this duplication 
mechanism in expanding the TPP gene family. The Ka/
Ks analysis further revealed that all the 14 duplicated 
GmTPP gene pairs had Ka/Ks ratios < 1, implying that 
they had undergone extensive purifying selection. Simi-
lar results have been observed in wheat and cotton [13]. 
Furthermore, the analysis collinearity patterns showed 
a closer relationship between soybean and wheat com-
pared to other plant species, such as Arabidopsis, maize, 
tomato, and rice, suggesting that soybean and wheat are 
closely related. [34].
Homologous genes with higher collinearity usually 
have similar functions [35]. Therefore, the soybean TPPs 
that show collinearity with members of the Arabidopsis 
TPP family possibly have similar functions. Our results 
revealed that GmTPP5, GmTPP14, and GmTPP15 were 
collinear with AtTPPD, suggesting that they may have 
similar functions. Previous studies revealed that the 
overexpression of AtTPPD improves plant tolerance to 
salt stress, increases plant starch levels under high soil 
salinity conditions, and regulates carbohydrate metabo-
lism [15]. Therefore, GmTPP5, GmTPP14, and GmTPP15 
could have been involved in soybean response to salt 
stress and improving the salt resistance capacity of soy-
bean. Furthermore, GmTPP10 was collinear with AtT-
PPE, which is know to regulateROS accumulation and 
promote ABA-inhibited root elongation [36].
Furthermore, extensive studies have revealed that 
TPP genes are expressed in various tissue. For exam-
ple, TaTPPA、TaTPPB, and TaTPPG are predominantly 
expressed in leaves, while TaTPP9-6A/D and TaTPP8-
5A/B/D are highly expressed in the roots [27]. Simi-
larly, the GmTPP gene family exhibits tissue-specific 
expression pattern. The expression of several GmTPPs 
(GmTPP4/9/14/15) show higher expression levels in 
root tissues, which is consistent with the expression 
patterns of their Arabidopsis homologs AtTPPD, AtT-
PPG, and AtTPPI, suggesting their involvement in the 
root development [37]. Furthermore, GmTPP15 shows 
high expressed in flowers, indicating its potential rolein 
soybean flowering. The high expression of GmTPP5, 
GmTPP7, GmTPP9, GmTPP10, and GmTPP13 in the 
leaves also suggested that they might play important 
roles in soybean leaf development. In soybean, GmTPP13 
was highly expressed in the pods at various developmen-
tal stages, implying it could be involved in pod develop-
ment. However, GmTPP14 and GmTPP15 were highly 
expressed in different tissues, indicating that they were 
involved in plant growth and development.
The predicted interaction network of GmTPP proteins 
with other transcription factors was also predicted based 
on an orthology-based method. The soybean TPP protein 
interacted with several transcription factors, including 
NAC, MYB, WRKY, and bHLH. These transcription fac-
tors are essential in regulating plant growth and devel-
opment and stress responses. For example, GmTPP2 
interacted with MYB93, MYB15, and WRKY8. AtMYB93 
is a negative modulator of lateral root development in 
Arabidopsis. The Atmyb93 mutant has a faster lateral 
root development and enhanced lateral root density [38]. 
MYB15 positively regulates the cold tolerance of toma-
toes through the CRT/DRE binding factors (CBF) path-
way [39].
Furthermore, the expression of WRKY8 induced by salt 
stress enhanced the plant tolerance to salt stress [40]. In 
rice, MYB61, which interacts with GmTPP15, improves 
grain yield and cold tolerance [41]. GmTPP15 also inter-
acts with AGL16, a negative regulator of stress response 
in Arabidopsis. AGL16 mutations promote seed germi-
nation, root elongation, and increased plant resistance 
to salt stress [42].The prediction of miRNA-targeted 
GmTPPs provides insights into the complex regulatory 
network governing the expression of these genes. The 
identification of 33 miRNAs targeting 14 GmTPPs high-
lights the intricate regulation of 33 miRNAs through 
miRNA-mediated pathways, of which six genes were 
targeted by at least four miRNAs, revealing the complex 
regulation network of GmTPPs. This miRNA-GmTPP 
relationship provides insights into the precise genetic 
engineering of GmTPPs through miRNA mediation. 
Integrating the protein interaction network and miRNA-
mediated pathways of GmTPPs could enhance our under-
standing of the regulation of stress responses and the 
growth and development of gene networks in soybean.
Under stress conditions, transcription factors are acti-
vated to bind specific cis-acting elements, regulating the 
expression of downstream stress-responsive genes. In this 
study, it was found that 89% of the TPP genes contained 
elements associated with anaerobic induction, which is 
relevant to waterlogging stress in soybean. However, reg-
ulating the TPP family genes may improve the resistance 
of soybean roots to waterlogging stress [43]. GmTPP2, 
GmTPP10, and GmTPP17 genes contain defense and 
stress, drought-inducible, and low temperature-respon-
sive elements, which may play a certain role in improving 
Page 13 of 18
Shao et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2023) 23:641 
 
the drought and cold resistance of plants. In addition, the 
flavonoid biosynthetic regulation elements regulate the 
biosynthesis of flavonoids in plants. Flavonoid accumula-
tion in plants is an important feature of plant resistance 
against environmental stresses. Besides, flavonoid com-
pounds improve the plant resistance to peroxidation and 
ultraviolet radiation [44, 45].Furthermore, the presence 
of flavonoid biosynthetic regulatory elements in GmTPP1 
and GmTPP15 suggests their involvement in flavonoid 
biosynthesis, which is important for plant resistance 
against environmental stresses. Moreover, more than half 
of the TPP genes contained ABA-responsive elements. 
In Arabidopsis, ABF2, a transcription factor responsive 
to ABA, directly binds the AtTPPE promoter, triggering 
its expression through ROS generation, which promotes 
root elongation and stomatal movement [36].
Previous studies revealed that trehalose production 
regulated by TPP genes alleviates the adverse effects 
of salt stress on plants [46, 47]. Herein, analysis of the 
response of the GmTPP genes to low-temperature, 
drought, saline-alkali, and exogenous trehalose stresses 
revealed that the gene expression profiles were similar 
after low-temperature and drought treatment. However, 
the expression induction, inhibition, or upregulation 
intensities were different. In this study, it was observed 
that GmTPP2 and GmTPP5 were significantly up-regu-
lated under saline-alkali stress and trehalose immersion, 
suggesting their potential roles in improving salt and 
drought tolerance. GmTPP5 had a collinear relationship 
with AtTPPD, which regulates plant tolerance to salt 
stress [15]. At the same time, GmTPP10 was significantly 
up-regulated under drought stress. Collinearity analy-
sis revealed that GmTPP10 was collinear with AtTPPE, 
whose overexpression enhances the drought resistance of 
Arabidopsis [36].
Moreover, GmTPP15 was significantly up-regulated 
under four abiotic stresses, indicating that its plays an 
important role in soybean response to abiotic stresses. 
Interestingly, the expression of most genes was up-regu-
lated under the saline-alkaline treatment and exacerbated 
after trehalose immersion. For example, the expression 
ratio of GmTPP2 was 2.2 under saline-alkaline stress for 
72  h but increased to 22.9 after trehalose immersion. 
Similarly, the expression ratio of GmTPP15 was increased 
from 15.2 to 20.5. These results are consistent to those 
found in tomatoes, where exogenous trehalose enhanced 
the expression of SlTPPJ and SlTPPH [48].
The GmTPPs may regulate soybean saline-alkali stress 
response by regulating trehalose metabolism. Trehalose 
plays a significant role in plant growth, development, and 
stress tolerance, especially tolerance to salt and drought 
stress [49], which explains the high trehalose concen-
trations in desert plants [50]. In this study, we drew a 
summary diagram of soybean response changes after 
Fig. 10 Trehalose metabolism in a plant cell, its role in carbohydrate metabolism and plant growth and development. Trehalose-6-phosphate 
(T6P) originates from the sucrose metabolic pathway. T6P is produced by the enzyme TREHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE (TPS) using 
UDP-glucose (UDPG) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), which is then transformed to trehalose by TREHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE (TPP) 
in the cytoplasm. Trehalose is cleaved into two molecules of glucose by TREHALASE1 (TRE1). The carbohydrate accumulation of plants was different 
under saline-alkali stress and exogenous trehalose
Page 14 of 18
Shao et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2023) 23:641 
salt-alkali stress and exogenous trehalose immersion 
(Fig. 10). Surprisingly, in this study, it was observed that 
sucrose and trehalose levels increased under saline-alka-
line treatment alone, regardless of the altered expression 
of GmTPP genes and the decrease in glucose, fructose, 
and starch contents. Notably, high levels of soluble carbo-
hydrate can positively regulated genes involved in sugar 
sensing and carbon metabolism under saline condi-
tions [51]. For example, enhancing sucrose synthesis and 
reducing sucrose decomposition to increase sucrose con-
tent alleviated salt stress in salt-tolerant sweet sorghum 
[52]. In soybean sprouts, this phenomenon could be 
attributed to the reduced hydrolysis rate of sucrose and 
the conversion of trehalose to glucose under saline-alka-
line stress. Trehalose immersion promoted the accumula-
tion of carbohydrates, including endogenous trehalose, in 
soybean sprouts during saline-alkali stress. These results 
are consistent with previous reports [48, 53]. Addition-
ally, analysis of ROS analysis revealed that saline-alkali 
sensitive varieties had higher ROS levels under saline-
alkali stress, while trehalose-immersed seeds exhibited 
reduced ROS accumulation. These results demonstrates 
that trehalose immersion induces the expression of 
GmTPP gene, enhances the accumulation of carbohy-
drates in plants, and reduces the accumulation of ROS 
in plants, thereby improving the saline-alkali tolerance of 
soybeans.
The analysis of TPP family genes in soybean is essen-
tial for further studies on the response of soybean to 
environmental stress, soybean growth and development, 
and soybean yield improvement under stress condi-
tions. Since plant stress resistance is an extremely com-
plex physiological process controlled by multiple genes, 
the effect of transforming a single gene to improve plant 
stress resistance is significantly limited. However, add-
ing and applying TPP gene promoters could resolve the 
shape changes of TPP gene plants [54]. Besides, using tre-
halose defense response to breed high-performing varie-
ties under drought and salt stress is one of the research 
hotspots. With the deepening of our understanding of 
the specific biological function of trehalose, trehalose 
is expected to play a more important role in breeding 
resistance in crops.
Conclusions
A total of 18 GmTPP genes were identified in the soybean 
genome and classified into three groups. The GmTPPs 
are highly conserved in soybean and involved in response 
to abiotic stresses. The results of RNA-seq showed that 
GmTPP genes are enriched in the trehalose biosynthe-
sis pathway. Furthermore, exogenous trehalose applica-
tion up-regulates GmTPPs, reducing ROS accumulation 
in plants and increasing the carbohydrate concentration 
under saline-alkaline stress, alleviating plant damage 
caused by saline-alkaline stress. The transcription fac-
tors-GmTPPs and miRNA-GmTPPs regulation relation-
ships reveal the regulatory network of genes regulating 
the response to abiotic stress. The findings in this study 
unravel the biological activities of GmTPP proteins in 
developmental processes and stress responses in soy-
bean, essential in breeding cultivars resistant to abiotic 
stresses.
Methods
Identification and classification of TPP genes in soybean
To identify the TPP family members in soybean, we 
downloaded the soybean reference genome assembly 
(Glycine max Wm82.a2.v1) and the gene annotation file 
from the Ensembl plants (http:// jul20 18- plants. ensem 
bl. org/ index. html). At the same time, the HMMER pro-
gram was used to search the TPP family gene sequences 
against the Pfam (http:// pfam. xfam. org/) library to iden-
tify the TPP genes in soybean. Subsequently, the TPP 
(Trehalose_PPase, PF02358) protein domains were iden-
tified using the SMART (http:// smart. embl- heide lberg. 
de) and CDD (https:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih.gov/Structure/
cdd/wrpsb.Cgi) websites, and proteins lacking the TPP 
domain were removed [55]. Next, the isoelectric point 
and molecular weight of soybean TPP proteins were cal-
culated using the bioinformatics resource portal, ExPASy 
(http:// prosi te. expasy. org/). The subcellular localization 
of GmTPP proteins was predicted using WoLF PSORT 
(https:// wolfp sort. hgc. jp/). The GmTPP genes were 
named based on their location on the chromosomes after 
their physical locations were mapped using MapChart 
software (https:// www. wur. nl/ enshow/ Mapch art/) [56]. 
Subsequently, the TPP protein sequences encoded by 
TPP genes in Arabidopsis, maize, wheat (Triticum aes-
tivum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and rice were 
downloaded from Phytozome13 or TAIR (https:// www. 
arabi dopsis. org/). All the TPP protein sequences in soy-
bean obtained via the HMMER search were imported 
into MEGA X, and aligned. The ClustalW program 
in MEGA-X software was used to conduct multiple 
sequence alignment of TPP genes from multiple spe-
cies, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using a 
maximum likelihood (ML) with 1000 bootstraps. Next, a 
phylogenetic tree was generated in the bootstrap analy-
sis using MEGA11. The phylogenetic tree was visualized 
and optimized using iTOL (https:// itol. embl. de/) [57]. 
At the same time, the MEME online tool (http:// meme. 
nbcr. net/ meme/) was used to detect the GmTPPs motif, 
with 10 as the maximum number of lookups. Thereaf-
ter, the distribution map of the motifs was constructed 
by TBtools. The number of motifs was then compared 
among the GmTPPs to identify the group-conserved or

group-specific signatures. Exon–intron structures of 
TPP genes in soybean were identified by the coding and 
the genomic sequences in Glycine max Wm82.a2.v1. 
The exon–intron structures were analyzed using Gene 
Structure Display Server (GSDS) (http:// gsds. cbi. pku. 
edu. cn/). Finally, the expression data of GmTPPs in the 
specific tissues were obtained from the Phytozome data-
base (https:// phyto zomne xt. jgi. doe. gov/ pz/). We predict 
the 3D structure of GmTPP protein by homology mod-
eling method. First, we use the location-specific iterative 
BLAST algorithm (PSI-BLAST) to find the most similar 
homology in the PDB database (http:// www. rcsb. org/), 
and then use the Swiss-Model interactive tool (https:// 
swiss model. expasy. org/ inter active/) to predict the 3D 
structure of the GmTPP protein. In addition, in the save 
server 
(http:// nihse rver. mbi. ucla. edu/ SAVES/) 
using 
PROCHECK test to detect the TPP protein 3D structure, 
and through Pymol software to display 3D structure.
Homology analysis of the GmTPP family members
The soybean whole genome protein sequences were 
aligned using BLAST. Next, the whole genome collinear-
ity analysis was performed using the MCScanX software. 
The non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) were 
used to assess the selection history and divergence time 
[58]. Ka and Ks substitution rates per TPP gene pair were 
calculated using the Simple Ka/Ks Calculator in TBtools. 
At the same time, MCScanX was used to analyze the 
gene duplication events of GmTPPs, which were subse-
quently visualized using TBtools.
Analysis of the GmTPP promoters
The upstream 2000 bp coding DNA sequences (CDS) of 
GmTPPs were retrieved from the soybean genome and 
mapped against the PlantCare database (http:// bioin 
forma tics. psb. ugent. be/ webto ols/ plant care/) to identify 
the putative cis-regulatory elements in the promoter 
regions [59]. Subsequently, the putative cis-regulatory 
elements were visualized using Tbtool [60]. In addition, 
the GmTPPs expression levels in the specific tissues were 
obtained from the Phytozome database. Finally, TBtools 
and circos (version 0.69) (http:// circos. ca/) were used to 
visualize the results [61].
Plant materials and growth conditions
Inbred “Niuyanjing” (saline-alkali tolerant genotype, N) 
soybean seeds were provided by the National Coarse 
Cereals Engineering Research Center (Daqing, Heilongji-
ang, China). The seeds were surface-sterilized in 5% (v/v) 
sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) for 5 min and then thor-
oughly rinsed with distilled water. After sterilization, 
the seeds were assigned to five groups. Seeds in the first 
group were germinated in Petri dishes lined with a wet 
filter paper for 2 d in the dark at 25 °C before they were 
incubated in the refrigerator at 4 ℃ for 3 d. For seeds in 
groups two and three, drought and saline-alkali stresses 
were induced by soaking the seeds in 5% PEG-6000 
(PEG treatment) or 10  mL mixed saline-alkali solution 
(NaCl,  Na2CO3,  NaHCO3,  Na2SO4; molar ratio—1:1:9:9) 
of 160  mmol/L (saline-alkali treatment) for 3 d. In the 
fourth groups, the seeds were soaked in 10 mmol/L tre-
halose for 12 h, incubated in distilled water for 36 h, and 
finally treated with 160 mmol/L mixed saline-alkali solu-
tion for 3 d (T + SA treatment). The last group served as 
a control, kept the seeds in water. After 2 d of distilled 
water culture, hypocotyl, radicle and cotyledon were col-
lected for tissue-specific expression analysis. The root tis-
sue of soybean treated with 4 ℃, PEG, saline-alkali, and 
T + SA for 2 d were used for gene expression analysis, 
using those in water culture as the control. Each treat-
ment had three biological replicates.
RNA isolation and transcriptome and qRT‑PCR analysis
The total RNA in the soybean tissues except the cotyle-
don was exacted 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after being treated 
with 80 and 160 mmol/L saline-alkali solution using the 
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) 
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quan-
tity of the extracted RNA was detected using NanoDrop 
(Thermo, Carlsbad, CA, United States). The  OD260/280 of 
the extracted RNA was between 1.8 and 2.2, while 28S/ 
18S was greater than 1, indicating good quality. The RNA 
integrity was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 
(Agilent Technologies, Carlsbad, California). The quali-
fied RNA was used for RNA library construction. At 
the same time, we used these samples for transcriptome 
sequencing and identification of differentially expressed 
gene RNA-seq data validation.
The RNA sequencing was performed on the Illumina 
HiSeq platform at BMK (Biomarker Technologies, Bei-
jing, China) with three biological replicates per treat-
ment. The raw sequencing data were filtered to remove 
adapter sequences and obtain high-quality clean reads. 
Reads with > 50% of the bases having a Q-value ≤ 5 
were retained. The clean sequences of each library were 
mapped to the reference sequence (https:// phyto zomne 
xt. jgi. doe. gov/ info/ Gmax_ Wm82_ a2_ v1) using TopHat 
(http:// tophat. cbcb. umd. edu/). In addition, the dif-
ferentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined 
using default parameters, including a false discov-
ery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and a logarithm two-fold change 
|log2FC|≥ 2. Subsequently, the Gene Ontology (GO) 
and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
enrichment analysis and annotation of the DEGs were 
performed using the KEGG pathway database (http://

Moreover, the total RNA from the T + SA treatment 
was reverse transcribed using oligo (dT) primer and 
SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase (TaKaRa, Nanjing, 
China). qRT-PCR was then performed using SYBR green 
(TaKaRa Biotechnology) on Roche Cycler 480II system 
(Roche, Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland). The gene-
specific primers (Additional file  7. Table  S5) for each 
GmTPPs were designed using Premier 5.0 software [62]. 
GmACTIN-11 was used as the internal control gene. 
Each treatment had three biological and three independ-
ent replicates. Finally, the relative gene expression of 
GmTPPs was analyzed using the 2 −ΔΔc(t) method [63].
Nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), diaminobenzidine (DAB) 
and trypan blue (TB) staining
The soybean sprouts were treated with different stress 
treatments for 3 d and stained with NBT, DAB and TB 
dye solutions according to previously reported methods 
[64]. NBT, DAB and TB stainings were repeated thrice.
Carbohydrate and trehalose contents analysis
Frozen tissues (100–150 mg) were weighed and ground 
for 30 to 60  s. Sugars (Sucrose, fructose, and glucose) 
were then extracted following the method described by 
Lunn et al. (2006) with minor modifications [46]. At the 
same time, starch was extracted from the precipitate 
during the extraction of soluble sugars and quantified 
through Glc analysis during hydrolysis. To generate the 
standard curve, standard glucose, fructose, and sucrose 
(Sigma, purity ≥ 99.9%) samples were accurately weighed, 
and each prepared into a mother liquor (10 mg/mL). The 
standard mixture was then diluted into a standard solu-
tion. Finally, the standard curve of the different sugars 
with the abscissa and ordinate as the mass concentration 
and chromatographic peak area, respectively, was gener-
ated [48]. The trehalose content was measured using a 
trehalose kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China).
Prediction of the transcription factors and miRNAs
The transcription factors interacting with GmTPP genes 
were predicted using the Plant Transcriptional Regula-
tory Map website (http:// plant regmap. gao- lab. org/ netwo 
rk. php) based on the homologous genes between soy-
bean and Arabidopsis. At the same time, the psRNATar-
get server (https:// www. zhaol ab. org/ psRNA Target/) was 
used to predict the target relationships between miRNA 
and TPP genes in soybean [65]. Briefly, the CDS sequence 
of TPP genes in soybean was submitted as target can-
didates against the published miRBase of soybean. The 
default option was selected for other parameters. The 
results were visualized using Cytoscape [66]
Statistical analyses
Each experiment was performed in triplicates. All data 
were analyzed and presented as mean ± standard devia-
tion (SD). The data were analyzed by student’s t-test at 
P < 0.05 (statistically significant and P < 0.01 (highly statis-
tically significant) levels of significance.
