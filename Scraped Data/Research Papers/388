Background. Te pathogenesis of coronary artery disease is complex, and infammation is one of the regulatory factors. Te
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 1 (NLRP1) plays an important role in the cellular
infammatory response, cell apoptosis, cell death, and autoimmune diseases. Whether the level of NLRP1 is related to the severity
of coronary artery stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been reported. Objective. To test the serum level
of NLRP1 in unstable angina (UA) patients and investigate the efect of NLRP1 on coronary stenosis severity of the coronary
artery disease (CAD). Methods. 307 patients hospitalized in the Department of Cardiology of the Afliated Hospital of Xuzhou
Medical University for coronary angiography from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022 were included. We detect the level of
NLRP1 in the serum of the included patients. Patients were divided into UA group and control group according to coronary
angiography results and other clinical data. We use logistic regression to screen the infuencing factors of UA. Ten, subgroups
were divided according to the Gensini score and the number of coronary artery lesions, and the diference of serum NLRP1 level
between the groups was compared. Spearman correlation analysis was used to explore the correlation between the serum NLRP1
level and Gensini score. We analyze the diagnostic value of NLRP1 for UA by drawing ROC curve. Results. Te median level of
serum NLRP1 in patients with UA (n  257) was 49.71 pg/ml, IQR 30.15, 80.21, and that in patients without UA (n  50) was
24.75 pg/ml, IQR 13.49, 41.95. Serum NLRP1 levels were signifcantly diferent among diferent subgroups. Te patient’s Gensini
score was correlated with the patient’s serum NLRP1 level. Conclusion. Te serum NLRP1 level is increased in patients with UA,
which is increased with the increasing severity of coronary lesions.
1. Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of global
incidence rate and mortality. According to the statistics of
the World Health Organization, atherosclerotic cardiovas-
cular disease (ASCVD) has become one of the main diseases
threatening human health, with high morbidity, rapid
progress, and high mortality as the main characteristics [1].
Infammation is involved in the occurrence and develop-
ment of atherosclerosis [2, 3]. With the in-depth and
comprehensive study of apoptotic bodies and autophago-
somes, infammatory bodies are increasingly favored by
researchers.
Te
nucleotide-binding
oligomerization
domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 1 (NLRP1, also known
as NALP1, DEFCAP, NAC, and CARD7) can activate
caspase-1
and
promote
the
infammatory
cytokine
interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) mature
and aggravate infammatory reaction [4]. Te NLRP1 in-
fammatory body is the frst infammatory body found in
human THP-1 monocytes. It is composed of NLRP1,
caspase-1, caspase-5, junction protein ASC, and CARDI-
NAL. It forms the frst line of defense of the host by acti-
vating infammatory cytokines [5]. Tere is evidence that
coronary atherosclerotic heart disease is the result of mul-
tiple signal transduction pathways [6]. It was found that the
knockout of NLRP1 gene alleviates the occurrence and
Hindawi

development of myocardial hypertrophy and infammation
in mice [7, 8]. However, whether NLRP1 will play a similar
role in the occurrence and development of coronary ath-
erosclerosis and whether the level of NLRP1 is positively
related to the degree of coronary stenosis in patients with
coronary artery disease have not been reported yet. In this
study, we determined the infuence of the NLRP1 level on
the degree of coronary stenosis and prognosis of patients
with coronary artery disease by detecting the level of NLRP1
in the serum of patients with coronary artery disease, in
order to explore new targets and new strategies for the
prevention and treatment of coronary atherosclerotic artery
disease.
2. Patients and Methods
2.1. Study Population. Tis study continuously included 307
patients who underwent coronary angiography in the
Cardiology Department of Xuzhou Medical University
Afliated Hospital from January 1, 2021, to December 31,
2022, due to unexplained chest pain (Figure 1). All patients
should complete relevant examinations such as blood
routine, liver and kidney functions, coagulation functions,
electrocardiogram, chest CT, and cardiac ultrasound before
surgery. Te preoperative evaluation of the patient was based
on the above auxiliary examinations, and surgical contra-
indications such as severe liver and kidney dysfunction,
electrolyte disorders, coagulation dysfunction, and iodine
contrast agent allergy were ruled out. Te patients with lung
infection, malignant tumor, hematologic diseases, liver and
kidney insufciency, autoimmune disease, heart valve dis-
ease, myocardiopathy, data loss, and failure to do relevant
examinations were not included in this study. According to
the results of coronary angiography and clinical data, CAD is
diagnosed when there is at least one major epicardial vessels
stenosis diameter ≥50%. Te 257 patients were diagnosed
with UA through clinical manifestation, angiography, and
other clinical examinations [9]. Te control group consisted
of 50 patients with unexplained chest pain. Tey received
coronary angiography, but the results did not meet the
diagnostic criteria for CAD. All patients agreed to undergo
angiography and plasma collection. Blood samples were
collected during cardiac catheterization before angiography.
According to the Gensini scoring system specifed by the
American Heart Association and the severity of stenosis and
corresponding coefcients of each coronary artery were
calculated [10]. Te subjects were divided into three groups
according to Gensini score, namely, low-risk group (Gensini
score < 30
points,
n  148),
medium-risk
group
(30 ≤ Gensini score < 60 points, n  66), and high-risk group
(Gensini score ≥ 60 points, n  43). According to the results
of coronary angiography, the number of branches of the
three main arteries [(eft anterior descending artery (LAD),
left circumfex artery (LCX), and right coronary artery
(RCA)) involved in the lesion were divided into control
group (n  50), single vessel lesion group (n  88), and
multivessel lesion group (n  169). Since the left main
coronary artery (LMCA) is the main branch of LAD and
LCX, LMCA lesions are considered as two branch lesions.
Te severity of coronary artery disease was evaluated by
Gensini score and the number of coronary artery lesions.
Te study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki
Declaration and approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Afliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University (No:
XYFYLW2017-002) [11].
2.2. Methods. Patients’ general data (gender, age, BMI,
smoking history, alcohol history, hypertension history, and
diabetes history), laboratory data (platelets, neutrophils,
lymphocytes, monocytes, C-reactive protein, aspartate ami-
notransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, f-
brinogen, glutamine transpeptidase, urea, creatinine, uric
acid, cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, low-
density lipoprotein, and lipoprotein-a), statin use, aspirin use,
and Imaging data, etc., were analyzed to compare the dif-
ference of clinical data among diferent groups of patients. All
the subjects collected venous blood on an empty stomach
within 24 hours after admission and tested it in the Bio-
chemical Department of the Afliated Hospital of Xuzhou
Medical University. Te Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent
Assay (ELISA) was used to detect the serum NLRP1 level in
enrolled patients. Patients who were tested for serum NLRP1
levels experienced discomfort symptoms such as chest pain
within 24 hours before blood sampling. Te ELISA kit was
purchased from CUSABIO BIOTECH CO., Ltd, and the
serum NLRP1 level was detected in strict accordance with the
user manual [12]. To analyze the diference of serum NLRP1
level between UA patients and non-UA patients, the re-
lationship between serum NLRP1 level and Gensini score, the
relationship between serum NLRP1 level and the number of
coronary artery lesions, and the correlation between serum
NLRP1 level and Gensini score were considered.
2.3. Statistical Methods. First, Shapiro–Wilk test was used to
test the normality of the measurement data. If it obeys the
normal distribution, it is represented by X ± SD. If the
normal distribution is not obeyed, the median (interquartile
interval, IQR) shall be used. Classifcation variables are
expressed in frequency (percentage). Te variables between
control group and UA group, each Gensini scoring group,
and each coronary artery disease branch group were com-
pared with ANOVA, nonparametric test, and chi-square
test, correcting the results of intergroup comparisons using
the FDR method. Logistic regression analysis is used to
screen for risk factors of UA onset. Spearman correlation
analysis was used to explore the correlation between the
serum NLRP1 level and Gensini score. We draw the ROC
curve to explore the predictive value of NLRP1 for UA.
3. Results
3.1. Comparison of Control Group and UA Patients. After
screening, a total of 307 people were included in this study,
with an average age of 64.08 ± 10.26 years, of whom 57.98%
were male (median Gensini score was 20.0, IQR 8.0, 41.0).
Among them, 257 people were patients with UA (median
Gensini score was 24.0, IQR 14.3, 46.0) and 50 people were

patients without UA (median Gensini score was 5.0, IQR 2.9,
7.0). Te age (66.0years old IQR 57.0, 72.0), the prevalence of
diabetes (30.7%), serum fbrinogen (2.93g/L, IQR 2.48, 3.27),
the Gensini score (24.0, IQR 14.3, 46.0), and serum NLRP1
(49.71pg/ml, IQR 30.15, 80.21) levels of UA patients were
signifcantly higher than those of non-UA patients (the age was
62.5years old, IQR 53.0, 68.25; the prevalence rate of diabetes
was 12%; the median serum fbrinogen was 2.67 g/L, IQR 2.29,
2.95; the median Gensini score was 5.0, IQR 2.9, 7.0; the
median serum NLRP1 was 24.75pg/ml, IQR 13.49, 41.95), with
statistically signifcant diferences (P < 0.05). Detailed baseline
characteristics for the study population are reported in Table 1.
3.2. Multivariate Logistic Analysis of Unstable Angina.
NLRP1, age, diabetes, TG, LDL-C, FIB, and NE were used for
multivariate binary logistic analysis. Multivariate logistic re-
gression analysis was conducted based on whether UA occurred:
yes 1, no 0. Te results showed that NLRP1 was an in-
dependent risk factor for UA (P < 0.05), and its level was pos-
itively correlated with the occurrence of UA, as shown in Table 2.
3.3. Serum NLRP1 Level and the Severity of Coronary
Atherosclerosis. According to the results of coronary angiog-
raphy, a total of 257 patients (median Gensini score 24.0, IQR
14.3, 46.0) can be diagnosed as UA. Te mean number of
coronary artery lesions was 1.66±0.48. In all grouping methods,
the serum NLRP1 level (median 24.75pg/ml, IQR 13.49, 41.95)
of patients with non-UA was always the lowest and had sta-
tistically signifcant diference with other groups (P < 0.05).
3.3.1. Serum NLRP1 Level and Gensini Score. According to
the analysis after grouping according to Gensini score, the
serum NLRP1 level in the control group (median 24.75 pg/

level in the high-risk group (median 83.57 pg/ml, IQR 63.39,
131.18) is the highest. Te median level of serum NLRP1 in
low-risk group and medium-risk group was 34.64 pg/ml,
IQR 24.12, 56.14, and 69.99 pg/ml, IQR 53.13, 87.68, re-
spectively. With the increase of Gensini score, the serum
NLRP1 level of patients increased, and the diference of
serum NLRP1 level between groups was statistically sig-
nifcant (P < 0.05). Using the FDR method to correct the
results of intergroup comparisons, the results still have
statistical signifcance (Table 3, Figure 2).
3.3.2. Serum NLRP1 Expression Level and Branch Number of
Coronary Lesions. In the study of grouping based on the
number of coronary artery lesions (Table 4, Figure 3). Te
serum NLRP1 level in the control group (median 24.75 pg/
ml, IQR 13.49, 41.95) was still the lowest, while the serum
NLRP1 level in the multivessel disease group (median
63.17 pg/ml, IQR 35.25, 91.20) was the highest. Te median
level of serum NLRP1 in patients with single vessel disease
was 33.00 pg/ml, and IQR was 20.36, 57.72. With the in-
crease of the number of coronary artery lesions, the serum
NLRP1 level of patients increased, and the diference of

in patients with coronary artery disease, we selected unstable
angina, which is a common type of coronary artery disease.
According to our results, the serum NLRP1 level in patients
with UA was signifcantly higher than that in patients
without UA. Trough binary logistic regression analysis, we
found that NLRP1 is an independent risk factor for the
occurrence of unstable angina. According to the patients’
coronary arteriosclerosis Gensini score, there were difer-
ences in serum NLRP1 levels among the control group, low-
risk group, medium-risk group, and high-risk group. Te
serum NLRP1 level of patients showed an obvious upward
trend with the increase of Gensini score. Similarly, according
to the number of coronary diseased branches, the serum
NLRP1 level increased with the increase of the number of
coronary diseased branches. Te serum NLRP1 level in
patients with multivessel disease was signifcantly higher
than that in control group and patients with single vessel
disease. Te level of serum NLRP1 is positively correlated
with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis. Because the
serum NLRP1 level may change due to the patients sufering
from certain infammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases,
blood diseases, malignant tumors, liver and kidney dys-
function, and other diseases, this experiment has not been
included in this population. However, the experimental
results are still signifcant to a considerable extent, which
further indicates that the experimental results are reliable.
Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease is a relatively
common type of cardiovascular disease, which refers to the
heart disease that coronary atherosclerotic lesions or va-
sospasm cause coronary artery lumen stenosis or occlusion,
and then cause myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, or necrosis, as
referred to as coronary artery disease. Age, smoking, body
mass index, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and
hyperhomocysteinemia (HCY) are important risk factors
afecting the occurrence and development of coronary artery
disease. Te pathogenesis of coronary artery disease is
complex, which is the result of many factors. Among them,
infammation is one of the regulatory factors of myocardial
infarction pathology [13]. After myocardial infarction and
necrosis death of myocardial cells, cardiac repair/remodel-
ing can cause infammatory reaction, leading to some im-
portant structural changes in the infarcted area and distal
end. Te degree and duration of infammation can change
the subsequent development process. In addition to acti-
vating infammation and destroying myocardial tissue,
migrated neutrophils and classically activated macrophages
also alternately activate macrophages and myocardial my-
osin for fbrosis repair and reducing infammatory response
[14, 15].
Infammatory corpuscles belong to the pattern recog-
nition receptors (PRRs) family, called NOD-like receptors
(NLRs). Tey are multiprotein complexes and members of

the cytoplasmic protein family. Tey promote the pro-
duction of caspase-1 dependent bioactive IL-1β through the
formation of infammatory corpuscles, thereby promoting
the secretion of IL-1β and the downstream infammatory
response [4]. It has been confrmed that NLRP1 is associated
with a variety of autoimmune diseases, such as enteritis,
Addison’s disease, vitiligo, type I diabetes, and rheumatoid
arthritis [16, 17]. NLRP1 also plays an important role in
nervous system diseases and is involved in the pathogenesis
of acute angle closure glaucoma [18, 19]. NLRP1 is also an
innate immune sensor, which produces IL-18 under met-
abolic stress and inhibits obesity and metabolic syndrome
[20]. Studies have confrmed that apoptosis plays an im-
portant role in the occurrence and development of myo-
cardial infarction [21, 22]. NLRP1 is the frst member of the
CED-4 family of apoptotic proteins found, which is essential
for the initiation of programmed cell death in developing
nematodes [23]. Related studies have confrmed that over-
expression of NLRP1 in mammalian cells can lead to ap-
optosis [24]. NLRP1 plays an important role in cellular
infammation, apoptosis, cell death, and autoimmune dis-
eases. NLRP1 is closely related to apoptosis and in-
fammation signal pathway. Some studies have shown that
inhibiting NLRP1 can reduce the infammatory pathway and
disease progression of some nervous system diseases
[25–27]. In stroke patients, the expression of NLRP1 will
increase and will activate the infammatory reaction and
eventually lead to neuronal death [28]. As for the patho-
genesis of coronary atherosclerosis, the current mainstream
is the endothelial injury response theory, which involves
a variety of infammatory cells, secretes a variety of growth
factors and proinfammatory mediators, and ultimately leads
to coronary stenosis. Once there is a contradiction between
coronary blood supply and myocardial blood demand,
coronary blood fow cannot meet the needs of myocardial
metabolism, which can cause myocardial ischemia and
hypoxia. Temporary ischemia and hypoxia cause angina
pectoris, while continuous severe myocardial ischemia can
cause myocardial necrosis, namely, myocardial infarction.
Te process of coronary atherosclerosis and coronary artery
disease is closely related to infammation, but the re-
lationship between NLRP1 and coronary atherosclerosis
needs further exploration. Whether NLRP1 can directly or
indirectly protect or damage vascular endothelial cells at the
physiological and pathological levels is still unknown. At
present, there are few studies on NLRP1 and coronary ar-
teriosclerosis, and there is no systematic and comprehensive
elaboration on its mechanism. Te complex relationship
network between NLRP1 and coronary atherosclerosis needs
to be further explored, and the correlation between serum
NLRP1 and coronary atherosclerosis needs to be further
clarifed. In previous research, our research team found that
the knockout of NLRP1 gene will inhibit MAPKs and NF- κ
B signal pathway, thereby reducing the occurrence and
development of myocardial hypertrophy and infammation
in mice [7, 8]. Compared to NLRP1, research on NLRP3 is
relatively extensive. NLRP3 has been considered to be re-
lated to autoimmune diseases, tumors and, of course, cor-
onary
atherosclerosis.
Te
triggering
and
activation
mechanisms of NLRP3 activation are usually consistent
among diferent species. However, the situation of NLRP1 in
humans and mice may not be the same, as they exhibit
signifcant diferences, which makes NLRP1 more important
in clinical research [29, 30]. But up to now, there is no
clinical study involving the relationship between coronary
atherosclerosis and NLRP1.
Te advantage of this study is that the number of coronary
artery lesions and Gensini score is used to represent the severity
of coronary atherosclerosis. Te Gensini score combined with
the number of coronary artery lesions to evaluate and express
the severity of coronary atherosclerosis is more reliable and
objective than a single indicator. Te results suggest that
NLRP1 is closely related to the severity of coronary artery
disease in patients with UA. It can lay a clinical foundation for
the later study of the role and molecular mechanism of NLRP1
on cardiac remodeling and heart failure in patients with CAD
and has strong feasibility in theory. Te test method is easy to
learn, not complicated, and can be popularized. Our study laid
the foundation for exploring the relationship between NLRP1
and coronary atherosclerosis and provided objective evidence
support. It has important clinical signifcance to provide a new
perspective and direction for the pathogenesis and treatment of
atherosclerosis and its related diseases. Te results can provide
ideas for exploring new targets and strategies for the prevention
and treatment of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease.
Based on the baseline characteristics of this study, there
is no diference in multiple cardiovascular risk factors be-
tween patients with non-UA and patients with UA [31],
which may be due to the failure to control the drug use of
patients in the experimental design. Most patients have
begun to receive drug treatment before hospitalization or
coronary angiography, which afects some of the patients’
laboratory indicators. However, whether the use of drugs has
an impact on the serum NLRP1 level of patients needs
further research to confrm. Terefore, this is the limitation
of this experiment. Secondly, our assessment of the severity
of coronary atherosclerosis is based on coronary angiog-
raphy, which is unethical for normal people. Terefore, we
included patients with chest pain and suspected coronary
artery disease. Tis may signifcantly reduce the sample size
of the control group.
5. Conclusion
Te level of serum NLRP1 in patients with UA was sig-
nifcantly higher than that in patients without UA. NLRP1 is
closely related to coronary atherosclerosis and it can serve as
an efective indicator for predicting UA.
