Abstract: Water blooms caused by the invasive cyanobacterium Raphidiopsis raciborskii occur in many
reservoirs in the tropical and subtropical regions of China. In recent decades, this species has spread
rapidly to temperate regions. Phenotypic plasticity and climate warming are thought to promote
the worldwide dispersion of R. raciborskii. However, investigations into the genetic and phenotypic
diversities of this species have revealed signiﬁcant intraspeciﬁc heterogeneity. In particular, com-
petition between R. raciborskii and Microcystis aeruginosa was highly strain dependent. Although
the concept of an ecotype was proposed to explain the heterogeneity of R. raciborskii strains with
different geographic origins, microevolution is more reasonable for understanding the coexistence of
different phenotypes and genotypes in the same environment. It has been suggested that intraspeciﬁc
heterogeneity derived from microevolution is a strong driving force for the expansion of R. raciborskii.
Additionally, temperature, nutrient ﬂuctuations, and grazer disturbance are critical environmental
factors that affect the population establishment of R. raciborskii in new environments. The present
review provides new insights into the ecological mechanisms underlying the invasion of R. raciborskii
in Chinese freshwater ecosystems.

1. Introduction
Cyanobacterial blooms are severe environmental problems in eutrophic freshwater
ecosystems [1,2]. Raphidiopsis raciborskii (previously known as Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii)
is a ﬁlamentous bloom-forming cyanobacterium belonging to Nostocales with heterocysts
and akinetes (Figure 1A). Upon the occurrence of an R. raciborskii bloom, a signiﬁcant
amount of cell ﬁlaments usually distributes evenly in the water column (Figure 1B). As a
major producer of hepatotoxic cylindrospermopsin (CYN) and its analogs (Figure 1C) [3–6],
R. raciborskii often proliferates in lakes or reservoirs in tropical and subtropical zones [7,8],
posing a signiﬁcant threat to ecological safety. In the past decades, the occurrence frequency
of this species has been signiﬁcantly increased over the world, including both subtropical
and temperate zones of the globe [7,9,10]. Therefore, R. raciborskii was suggested to be an
invasive cyanobacterium, and much attention has been paid to its dispersion routes and
adaptation mechanisms [9,11,12].

was suggested to be an invasive cyanobacterium, and much attention has been paid to its 
dispersion routes and adaptation mechanisms [9,11,12].

borskii bloom. Scale bars in (A) and (B), 10 µm. 
Based on the phylogenetic relationship of strains isolated worldwide, three hypoth-
eses have been proposed for the biogeographic origin and global dispersion of R. raci-
borskii [7]. First, R. raciborskii was suggested to be derived from tropical regions in Africa 
due to its temperature dependence and the high diversity of African strains [13]. After 
invasion and colonization in Australia, R. raciborskii was dispersed throughout Eurasia 
and America [13]. Similarly, a recent study on the biogeography of R. raciborskii supports 
central Africa as the original dispersion center for nontoxic strains of this species [14]. The 
ability to produce CYN and paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) is thought to be acquired after 
dispersion to new settlements in tropical Africa and the South American continent [14]. 
Second, it was thought that R. raciborskii was extinct in most areas of the world during the 
Pleistocene Ice Age, except for the warm refuges of each continent at low latitudes [15]. 
The surviving R. raciborskii strains were dispersed to high-latitude areas when the global 
climate became warm. Third, R. raciborskii was thought to be derived from a tropical re-
gion in America and dispersed to other continents [11]. Considering that phylogeographic 
analysis was strongly affected by the genetic variation of the strains used in different stud-
ies [16], sufficient strains from different continents and environments should be investi-
gated to clarify the dispersion route of R. raciborskii. 
The invasion success of R. raciborskii was mainly ascribed to its phenotypic plasticity 
and growth optimization under different environments [9,17–20]. R. raciborskii is tolerant 
to low and high light intensity and a wide range of temperatures [19,21–25]. This species 
has flexible strategies for utilizing various forms of nitrogen (N), such as accumulating 
nitrogen as cyanophycin [26] and switching to N2 fixation under N depletion [27–29]. With 
a strong affinity for phosphate, R. raciborskii is capable of absorbing and storing a lot of 
phosphorus (P) [18,30]. After depletion of inorganic P, dissolved organic phosphorus can 
be used by R. raciborskii through the secretion of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) [31,32]. Thus, 
R. raciborskii can be dominant in the phytoplankton community at both very low and high 
N:P ratios [33]. In addition, it has been suggested that this species has a competitive ad-
vantage over other bloom-forming cyanobacteria under N- or P-limited conditions 
[30,34,35]. For example, toxic R. raciborskii is favored by the allelopathic effects of CYN on 
the surrounding phytoplankton [36–39]. 
Recent investigations have revealed high genetic and phenotypic diversity within the 
population of R. raciborskii [40–42]. The adaptation mechanisms of different strains were 
divergent and the competitive advantage of R. raciborskii against Microcystis aeruginosa

bloom. Scale bars in (A,B), 10 µm.
Based on the phylogenetic relationship of strains isolated worldwide, three hypotheses
have been proposed for the biogeographic origin and global dispersion of R. raciborskii [7].
First, R. raciborskii was suggested to be derived from tropical regions in Africa due to its
temperature dependence and the high diversity of African strains [13]. After invasion and
colonization in Australia, R. raciborskii was dispersed throughout Eurasia and America [13].
Similarly, a recent study on the biogeography of R. raciborskii supports central Africa as the
original dispersion center for nontoxic strains of this species [14]. The ability to produce
CYN and paralytic shellﬁsh poison (PSP) is thought to be acquired after dispersion to
new settlements in tropical Africa and the South American continent [14]. Second, it was
thought that R. raciborskii was extinct in most areas of the world during the Pleistocene Ice
Age, except for the warm refuges of each continent at low latitudes [15]. The surviving
R. raciborskii strains were dispersed to high-latitude areas when the global climate became
warm. Third, R. raciborskii was thought to be derived from a tropical region in America and
dispersed to other continents [11]. Considering that phylogeographic analysis was strongly
affected by the genetic variation of the strains used in different studies [16], sufﬁcient
strains from different continents and environments should be investigated to clarify the
dispersion route of R. raciborskii.
The invasion success of R. raciborskii was mainly ascribed to its phenotypic plasticity
and growth optimization under different environments [9,17–20]. R. raciborskii is tolerant
to low and high light intensity and a wide range of temperatures [19,21–25]. This species
has ﬂexible strategies for utilizing various forms of nitrogen (N), such as accumulating
nitrogen as cyanophycin [26] and switching to N2 ﬁxation under N depletion [27–29]. With
a strong afﬁnity for phosphate, R. raciborskii is capable of absorbing and storing a lot of
phosphorus (P) [18,30]. After depletion of inorganic P, dissolved organic phosphorus can
be used by R. raciborskii through the secretion of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) [31,32]. Thus,
R. raciborskii can be dominant in the phytoplankton community at both very low and high
N:P ratios [33]. In addition, it has been suggested that this species has a competitive advan-
tage over other bloom-forming cyanobacteria under N- or P-limited conditions [30,34,35].
For example, toxic R. raciborskii is favored by the allelopathic effects of CYN on the sur-
rounding phytoplankton [36–39].
Recent investigations have revealed high genetic and phenotypic diversity within the
population of R. raciborskii [40–42]. The adaptation mechanisms of different strains were
divergent and the competitive advantage of R. raciborskii against Microcystis aeruginosa was
strain dependent [43–46]. These ﬁndings indicated apparent intraspeciﬁc heterogeneity
in R. raciborskii. A comprehensive investigation of R. raciborskii diversity and dispersion
in local ecosystems can provide new insights into its invasion success. R. raciborskii has
been detected in many lakes and reservoirs in China [8,35,47–52]. The recent expansion of

R. raciborskii in Chinese freshwater bodies, its intraspeciﬁc heterogeneity, and critical factors
for its invasion are the focus of this review.
2. Distribution and Dispersion in China
The ﬁrst reported R. raciborskii bloom in Chinese water bodies occurred in 2002 at
21◦59′ N–22◦25′ N and 113◦05′ E–113◦25′ E [53]. To date, the presence of this species has
been observed from 20◦09′ N to 39◦59′ N and between 100◦03′ E and 121◦41′ E, that is,
from the tropical to temperate regions of China (Table S1, Figure 2). R. raciborskii was
distributed in the basins of Zhujiang River, Yangtze River, Huaihe River, Yellow River,
Haihe River, Yongjiang River, Qiantang River, and in the southeastern rivers in Fujian
and Taiwan (Figure 2). Dominance or high biomass of this species was observed in most
of the basins, except in the Haihe and Qiantang River basins. The Haihe River basin
is the northernmost line with the presence of R. raciborskii in China [50]; this species
may have dispersed to this basin recently and has not been fully adapted to the local
environment. Given that the Qiantang River basin is located in a subtropical zone with
favorable temperature conditions for the proliferation of R. raciborskii, its distribution in
this basin needs further investigation. Although historical data on R. raciborskii distribution
are lacking, it should be noted that bloom events of this species have increased in recent
decades. In 2006, only a low concentration of R. raciborskii ﬁlaments was observed in
Liangzi lake (30◦10′ N, 114◦36′ N) [48]. However, its biomass reached 52.03 mg L−1, with
an obvious water bloom between 2013 and 2017 [35]. This ﬁnding indicates that R. raciborskii
has evolved from an occasional species to a dominant species in Liangzi lake, which is
likely a typical succession process after the invasion of new water bodies.
has been detected in many lakes and reservoirs in China [8,35,47–52]. The rec
sion of R. raciborskii in Chinese freshwater bodies, its intraspecific heterogeneit
ical factors for its invasion are the focus of this review. 
2. Distribution and Dispersion in China 
The first reported R. raciborskii bloom in Chinese water bodies occurred
21°59′ N–22°25′ N and 113°05′ E–113°25′ E [53]. To date, the presence of this s

wan (Figure 2). Dominance or high biomass of this species was observed in m
basins, except in the Haihe and Qiantang River basins. The Haihe River basin is

2006, only a low concentration of R. raciborskii filaments was observed in Li
(30°10′ N, 114°36′ N) [48]. However, its biomass reached 52.03 mg L–1, with a
water bloom between 2013 and 2017 [35]. This finding indicates that R. raci
evolved from an occasional species to a dominant species in Liangzi lake, whi

large ﬂoods, creating opportunities for R. raciborskii to invade new environments. Water

diversion projects (WDPs) also provide an important dispersion route for aquatic organisms.
For example, ﬁsh invasion has occurred through the south-to-north WDP in China [54].
This WDP is designed to divert water from humid subtropical areas to arid or semi-arid
temperate areas and thus is favorable for the dispersion of R. raciborskii. Five lakes in the
Huaihe River basin were linked with three reservoirs and one pond in the Yellow and
Haihe River basins by the east route of the south-to-north WDP (Table S1), and abundant
R. raciborskii were observed in all of these water bodies. In addition, the ﬁlaments of this
species can be conveyed between lakes via natural water used for the transport of aquatic
products and ballast water of commercial ships [7]. Owing to their high survivability,
the akinetes of R. raciborskii are likely to be transported by migratory birds via feet or
gut carryover [55].

CYN is synthesized by a series of enzymes encoded by cyr genes [56]. Characterizin
the distribution and variation of cyr genes can provide insights into the dispersion 
CYN-producing R. raciborskii strains. A systematic investigation into the sequences of cy
and cyrJ genes in Chinese water bodies divided them into four and three main sequen
types, respectively (Table 1) [48]. It was shown that low-latitude reservoirs contain mo
sequence types. Given that Itype4af and Itype4ar are Itype1 variants with transpositio
elements, and that Jtype2b is a Jtype2a variant with a deletion of six nucleotides, the Ti
gang reservoir presumably contains all the ancestral cyrI and cyrJ sequence types. Th
finding indicated that low-latitude lakes in Southeast China are potential dispersion ce
ters of toxic R. raciborskii. Similarly, the tropical regions in Southeast China were al
thought to be a glacial refuge for higher plant species [57]. These findings provide furth
evidence for the refuge hypothesis about R. raciborskii dispersion [15]. PSP-producing 
raciborskii strains were also isolated and identified from Chinese water bodies [58,59]. Ph
logenetic analysis revealed that these strains were closely related to strains from the Nor
and South American continents [58]. This finding may imply the dispersion of PSP-pr
ducing strains from America to China because the ability of R. raciborskii to produce PS
was proposed to originate from America [14].

3. Intraspeciﬁc Heterogeneity
3.1. Phenotypic and Genetic Diversity
In previous studies on the environmental adaptability of R. raciborskii, it has often been
regarded as a homogenous population because of the highly similar 16S rRNA genes of
different strains. For example, most present studies suggest that R. raciborskii is a mesophile
with a tolerance to low temperatures [7,19,60,61]. However, laboratory experimentation has
found that several strains maintain a high growth rate at 15 ◦C, while the growth of some
strains is completely inhibited under low-temperature conditions [17,47]. These ﬁndings
indicate that low-temperature tolerance is not an intrinsic characteristic of R. raciborskii and
that signiﬁcant intraspeciﬁc heterogeneity exists for the temperature adaptability of this
species. Similarly, the intraspeciﬁc heterogeneity of R. raciborskii has also been found in
its response to light intensity [9,62,63] and conductivity [64], as well as its strategies for
the utilization of N [26,27] and P [41]. In addition, varied growth rates, morphologies, and
toxicities have been observed in genetically similar isolates of R. raciborskii [65,66].
In contrast to the 16S rRNA gene, the RNA polymerase C1 (rpoC1) gene and ITS-L
sequence, which is the larger fragment of the inter-transcribed sequence of rRNA, are
useful molecular markers for discriminating different R. raciborskii strains [58,67]. The
strains were classiﬁed into nontoxic, CYN-producing, and PSP-producing clusters based
on the phylogenetic analysis of rpoC1 and ITS-L [58]. This result is supported by the
genomic variations between R. raciborskii strains [16,42,68]. The relationship between
genetic diversity and phenotypic variation remains to be clariﬁed and requires further
systematic investigation.
The presence of cyr genes is the main genetic difference between CYN-producing and
non-CYN-producing strains [48]. However, genomic variations were also found in genes
associated with stress and adaptation, which are probably related to the physiological role
of CYN [42]. In fact, CYN has been shown to contribute to the successful invasion and
survival of R. raciborskii [4,5]. For example, CYN-producing strains have a competitive
advantage under nutrient-replete conditions [69]. In comparison to nontoxic R. raciborskii,
toxic strains have a more efﬁcient response to inorganic phosphorus and could become
dominant in the community [70]. A recent study also found that toxic strains were more
competitive under Fe-starved conditions [71].
Previous investigations have revealed that the cell quotas of CYN varied signiﬁcantly
between R. raciborskii strains [65,66,72]. However, the genetic basis of this ﬁnding remains
unknown. As aforementioned, sequence variations were observed for cyrI and cyrJ genes,
which encodes a hydroxylase and a sulfotransferase, respectively [48,73–75]. These two
enzymes catalyze tailoring reactions in the last two steps of CYN biosynthesis [56]. An
inactivated mutation of cyrI inhibits the synthesis of CYN, leading to an accumulation in
the intermediate product 7-deoxy-CYN [76]. Therefore, variations in cyr genes may change
the activity of the enzymes encoded by them and further affect CYN synthesis efﬁciency.
3.2. Competition between R. raciborskii and M. aeruginosa
M. aeruginosa is the dominant species in most eutrophic water bodies, both in China
and worldwide [51,77]. Competition against M. aeruginosa is inevitable for R. raciborskii

during invasion. However, recent culture experiments have produced inconsistent results
regarding the competition between R. raciborskii and M. aeruginosa (Table 2). Under light- or
P-limited conditions, both R. raciborskii and M. aeruginosa are likely to dominate the mixed
culture of these two species with equal starting biovolumes [45]. R. raciborskii, with N-
ﬁxation capability, was a more successful invader than M. aeruginosa when N was depleted
in batch culture [35]. Likewise, the model prediction of species competition outcomes is
strongly affected by the growth variability of strains [78]. These ﬁndings demonstrate the
intraspeciﬁc heterogeneity for R. raciborskii and M. aeruginosa [44].

with special physiological characteristics in its original habitats, and the geographic dis-
persion of this species is a dynamic selection process for existing ecotypes [60,61,72]. The
concept of an ecotype is reasonable for understanding the intraspeciﬁc heterogeneity of
R. raciborskii in different environments but not for explaining the coexistence of differ-
ent phenotypes and genotypes in the same environment [16,65]. Heterogeneity between
coexisting strains is better deﬁned as microevolution, the concept of which refers to mi-
nor variations within species [80]. Microevolution is the source of adaptive variation for
organisms, and the accumulation of microevolution may further lead to new speciation.
The ecotypes of R. raciborskii were presumably established by the natural selection of
heterogeneous strains generated during microevolution.

4. Critical Factors for Invasion
4.1. Temperature and Effective Accumulated Temperature (EAT)
Temperature is an important ecological factor that drives the global distribution of
R. raciborskii [10,13,81]. Climate warming is expected to increase the biomass of this species
and promote its dispersion in new habitats (Table 3). In addition to its proliferation in
warm areas, the dominance and bloom of this species were observed in cool water between
10 ◦C and 15 ◦C [22,47]. This ﬁnding indicates that R. raciborskii is likely to disperse and
survive in most freshwater bodies in China. Under nutrient-replete conditions, the potential
biomass that R. raciborskii can reach is probably determined by the Effective Accumulated
Temperature (EAT) affecting the heat that organisms can obtain during multiplication
seasons. To date, there are no available data on the effects of EAT on the growth of
R. raciborskii. In China, the EAT varies with latitude from south to north and altitude from
east to west. It is necessary to investigate the relationship between EAT and the distribution
of R. raciborskii to assess the bloom risk this species presents.

4.2. Nutrient Fluctuations
The coexistence of multiple species is frequently observed during cyanobacterial
blooms in eutrophic water bodies [51]. This ﬁnding implies that competitive exclusion
does not occur, which may be attributed to nutrient repletion in the environment. For
example, R. raciborskii may invade into an M. aeruginosa-dominated culture and survive
with relatively low biomass [35]. The coexistence of R. raciborskii and M. aeruginosa has been
found in many subtropical water bodies located in the Yangtze River basin [35]. Sometimes,
R. raciborskii becomes the dominant species in the phytoplankton community. Considering
intraspeciﬁc heterogeneity, it cannot be predicted that R. raciborskii will eventually compete
against M. aeruginosa.
Niche and ﬁtness differences are thought to determine invasion success in bacterial
communities [82]. Field investigations have demonstrated that Raphidiopsis, rather than
Microcystis, beneﬁt from low P concentrations [83]. This ﬁnding was supported by labo-
ratory experiments indicating that R. raciborskii could be advantageous under P-limited
conditions [34,84]. This advantage may be enhanced using the allelopathic effects of CYN,
which can induce extracellular ALP production in other phytoplankton species [39,85]. In
addition, stoichiometric analysis revealed a lower metabolic cost of synthesizing CYN than
that of producing ALP [39]. Moreover, N limitation may favor the growth of R. raciborskii
strains with N-ﬁxation capability. However, previous studies have claimed that this high-
energy-consuming function cannot support the proliferation of R. raciborskii [40]. Nutrient
ﬂuctuations frequently occur in natural water bodies [84,86,87]. Intermittent P and N limi-
tations may create opportunities for R. raciborskii to become dominant in the phytoplankton
community [87] and proliferate when nutrients are repleted (Table 3).

4.3. Grazer Disturbance
Local grazers have a significant impact on the structure of phytoplankton communities [88].
Daphnia feeding on R. raciborskii can hamper the population establishment of this species [88,89],
whereas copepods, preferentially grazing on non-Raphidiopsis species, can promote the
persistence of R. raciborskii [90,91] (Table 3). Therefore, a low grazing pressure or loss
of top-down control is a critical factor for the invasion success of R. raciborskii [88]. In
addition, CYN-producing strains may be more advantageous because of the toxicity of CYN
on zooplankton [5].
5. Conclusions
R. raciborskii has spread widely in Chinese freshwater bodies in recent decades. In
addition to its adaptability to various environments, the intraspeciﬁc heterogeneity of
R. raciborskii presumably has a signiﬁcant contribution to the species’ rapid expansion.
Temperature, nutrient ﬂuctuations, and grazer disturbance are important factors that affect
the invasion success of R. raciborskii.
6. Perspectives
6.1. Hypothesis for the Invasion Success of R. raciborskii
Field populations of R. raciborskii are mixtures of heterogeneous strains. When the
mixtures were dispersed in new environments, strains with strong adaptability could
survive under natural selection and evolve into ecotypes with speciﬁc genetic and phe-
notypic characteristics. Some ecotypes of R. raciborskii are likely to proliferate and form
blooms under appropriate conditions. In summary, the invasion success of R. raciborskii
may be ascribed to sufﬁcient intraspeciﬁc heterogeneity, rather than the adaptability of
individual strains.
6.2. Future Outlook
Given that R. raciborskii has a growth advantage under nutrient-limited conditions,
the expansion of this species may beneﬁt from a reduction in P and N during the reme-
diation of lake eutrophication [92]. To enhance our understanding of the bloom-forming
mechanisms of R. raciborskii, knowledge of the intraspeciﬁc heterogeneity of R. raciborskii
should be strengthened in the future. To accurately discriminate between strain differences,
quantitative traits should be deﬁned and investigated systematically. The growth rate,
photosynthetic rate, electron transfer rate, afﬁnity for inorganic carbon, pigment content,
extracellular ALP activity, toxin content, and critical requirements for nutrients, tempera-
ture, and light intensity, are candidate quantitative traits for R. raciborskii. Moreover, highly
variable genetic markers, such as ITS-L, can be used to discriminate strain differences at the
molecular level. The consistency between molecular markers and quantitative traits should
be carefully evaluated. Moreover, it is crucial to identify genes controlling quantitative
traits to provide more reliable genetic evidence for the heterogeneity of R. raciborskii.
When a speciﬁc ﬁeld population of R. raciborskii is investigated, many strains should
be isolated to fully capture their variability. Considering the effects of in-culture evolution
on laboratory experiments [93], strains should be maintained under conditions similar to
their original habitats, and their quantitative traits should be characterized after isolation
as soon as possible. To develop a worldwide database describing the intraspeciﬁc hetero-
geneity of R. raciborskii, uniﬁed and standard experimental methods and procedures are
required. Furthermore, attention should be paid to the effects of EAT on the distribution
and heterogeneity of R. raciborskii for assessing its bloom risk.
