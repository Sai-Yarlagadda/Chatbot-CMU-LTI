Introduction: The function, origin and structural features of circulating nuclear
DNA (cir-nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (cir-mtDNA) are poorly known, even
though they have been investigated in numerous clinical studies, and are involved
in a number of routine clinical applications. Based on our previous report
disproving the conventional plasma isolation used for cirDNA analysis, this
work enables a direct topological comparison of the circulating structures
associated with nuclear DNA and mitochondrial cell-free DNA.
Materials and methods: We used a Q-PCR and low-pass whole genome
sequencing (LP-WGS) combination approach of cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA,
extracted using a procedure that eliminates platelet activation during the
plasma isolation process to prevent mitochondria release in the extracellular
milieu.
Various
physical
procedures,
such
as
ﬁltration
and
differential
centrifugation, were employed to infer their circulating structures.
Results: DSP-S cir-mtDNA mean size proﬁles distributed on a slightly shorter
range than SSP-S. SSP-S detected 40-fold more low-sized cir-mtDNA fragments
(<90 bp/nt) and three-fold less long-sized fragments (>200 bp/nt) than DSP-S.
The ratio of the fragment number below 90 bp over the fragment number above
200 bp was very homogenous among both DSP-S and SSP-S proﬁles, being 134-
fold lower with DSP-S than with SSP-S. Cir-mtDNA and cir-nDNA DSP-S and SSP-
S mean size proﬁles of healthy individuals ranged in different intervals with periodic
sub-peaks only detectable with cir-nDNA. The very low amount of cir-mtDNA
fragments of short size observed suggested that most of the cir-mtDNA is poorly

fragmented and appearing longer than ~1,000 bp, the readout limit of this LP-WGS
method. Data suggested that cir-nDNA is, among DNA extracted in plasma,
associated with ~8.6% of large structures (apoptotic bodies, large extracellular
vesicles (EVs), cell debris. . .), ~27.7% in chromatin and small EVs and ~63.7% mainly
in oligo- and mono-nucleosomes. By contrast, cir-mtDNA appeared to be
preponderantly (75.7%) associated with extracellular mitochondria, either in its
free form or with large EVs; to a lesser extent, it was also associated with other
structures: small EVs (~18.4%), and exosomes or protein complexes (~5.9%).
Conclusion: This is the ﬁrst study to directly compare the structural features of cir-
nDNA and cir-mtDNA. The signiﬁcant differences revealed between both are due
to the DNA topological structure contained in the nucleus (chromatin) and in the
mitochondria (plasmid) that determine their biological stability in blood. Although
cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA are principally associated with mono-nucleosomes and
cell-free mitochondria, our study highlights the diversity of the circulating
structures associated with cell-free DNA. They consequently have different
pharmacokinetics
as
well
as
physiological
functions.
Thus,
any
accurate
evaluation of their biological or diagnostic individual properties must relies on
appropriate pre-analytics, and optimally on the isolation or enrichment of one
category of their cirDNA associated structures.

Introduction
Circulating DNA (cirDNA) possesses considerable potential for
the study of both healthy subjects and patients with underlying
pathological conditions (Stroun et al., 1977; Thierry et al., 2016).
Thus, recent advances in the understanding of cirDNA have seen its
use broadened, leading to the design of numerous speciﬁc
approaches, as is testiﬁed by its numerous current clinical
applications (Dennis Lo and Poon, 2003; Akirav et al., 2011; De
Vlaminck et al., 2014; Fernandez-Cuesta et al., 2016; Wan et al.,
2017; Zemmour et al., 2018; Pisareva et al., 2022a; Pisareva et al.,
2022b). CirDNA has been intensely studied, with signiﬁcant efforts
being made to improve its detection and to discriminate its tissue/
cells of origin, so that its diagnostic potential may be optimized
(Zemmour et al., 2018; Meddeb et al., 2019a; Bronkhorst et al.,
2020). CirDNA derives from both nuclear DNA (nDNA) and
extrachromosomal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (Murgia et al.,
1992; Zhong et al., 2000; Meddeb et al., 2019a; Bronkhorst et al.,
2020). However, most studies restricted themselves mainly to
nuclear cirDNA (cir-nDNA), as compared to mitochondrial
cirDNA (cir-mtDNA).
What is true for cir-nDNA, regarding improved knowledge of its
structures leading to improved detection, should also be true for cir-
mtDNA. Investigation on cirDNA structures has focused mainly on
cirDNA fragmentation (fragmentomics), since elucidation of the
cirDNA fragment size distribution may reveal characteristics linked
to their release mechanism, as well as the protection against
degradation in the blood stream, which is provided by DNA
packaging
in nucleoprotein/lipid
complexes. While DNA is
highly sensitive to DNase in a biological environment (Thierry
et al., 1997; Pös et al., 2018), its highly negatively charged
molecules have a signiﬁcant capacity to bind, reversely condense,
and pack tightly into macromolecular structures. nDNA is packed
within nucleosomes and condensed in a hierarchical and tunable
architecture mediated by DNA-protein interaction constituting the
chromatin in Archaea and eukaryotes (Carrivain et al., 2012). Since
mechanisms of extracellular DNA release may be various (NETosis,
apoptosis, necrosis, active release,. . .), DNA-protein complexes
may, in addition, be protected by blood ﬂoating particles such as
apoptotic
bodies,
vesicles
or
associated
with
degraded
cell
membranes; all of them likely lead to different plasma extracted
DNA pharmacokinetics (Fleischhacker and Schmidt, 2008; Thierry
et al., 2016; Bronkhorst et al., 2020).
CirDNA were ﬁrst considered to be mainly packed in
nucleosomes (Holdenrieder et al., 2006), and several reports have
shown
that
cirDNA
associated
structures
have
nucleosome
footprints (Chandrananda et al., 2015; Ivanov et al., 2015; Snyder
et al., 2016). We recently demonstrated that cirDNA are mainly
compacted within mono-nucleosomes, which apparently constitute
their most stable form, while di- or oligo-nucleosomes or larger
pieces of cirDNA constitute a very minor fraction of its population
(Sanchez et al., 2018; Sanchez et al., 2021). In addition, we
demonstrated that blunted and jagged double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) of size up to 220 bp and down to 70 bp are packed in
nucleosome/chromatosome
particles
(Sanchez
et
al.,
2021).
Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) assisted data on cirDNA distribution
corresponded to data obtained from low-pass whole genome
sequencing (LP-WGS) performed using single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) library preparation (SSP) rather than dsDNA library
preparation (DSP), allowing the harmonization of data obtained
from both techniques (Sanchez et al., 2018).
Despite all of this, we still understand far less about the
characteristics of cir-mtDNA than those of cir-nDNA, especially
its topology in circulation. In a recent study performed by our team,
we showed that the mitochondrial genome may be found in nearly
50,000-fold more copies than the nuclear genome in the plasma of

healthy individuals (HI, (Al Amir Dache et al., 2020). This suggests
the existence of stabilizing structures protecting mtDNA molecules,
thus allowing the detection and quantiﬁcation of cir-mtDNA in the
bloodstream (Fliss et al., 2000; Kohler et al., 2009; Meddeb et al.,
2019a; Otandault et al., 2020). We later demonstrated that blood
contains cell-free intact mitochondria as well as cir-mtDNA (Al
Amir Dache et al., 2020). Due to the lack of histone in mitochondria,
there is so far no full explanation for cir-mtDNA stabilization/
protection in the blood circulation.
The
accurate
differentiation
of
cirDNA
of
nuclear
and
mitochondrial origin is feasible (Kohler et al., 2009; Meddeb et al.,
2019a; Saﬁ and Najib, 2021), and may offer diagnostic information in
speciﬁc physiological or pathological situations (Zong et al., 2016;
Bezdan et al., 2020; Lowes et al., 2020; Otandault et al., 2020). Note,
we hypothesized that the respective quantitation of cir-mtDNA and cir-
nDNA may have potential cancer screening capacity (Thierry and El
Messaoudi, 2015; Meddeb et al., 2019a; Tanos et al., 2020).
Consequently, an elucidation of the structural features of cir-
mtDNA may improve their detection and quantiﬁcation. Up to
now, only the presence of circulating cell-free DNA either associated
with nucleosomes, or mitochondria (Al Amir Dache et al., 2020), or
vesicle containing mtDNA (Li et al., 2020; Malkin and Bratman, 2020;
Soltesz and Nagy, 2020) were revealed. No full characterization of cir-
nDNA or cir-mtDNA topology in blood was established. This study was
carried out from cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA extracted from plasma
preparation avoiding platelet activation. This warrants a proper
evaluation of the topological nature and content of cir-mtDNA as
demonstrated in our previous report (Roch et al., 2021) while enabling
the direct quantitative comparison of their various structural features.
Materials and methods
Sources of blood samples
All HI signed an informed consent and their samples were supplied
by the French Blood Establishment (EFS). Samples were collected using
a conventional process with the use of a dedicated needle, a vacutainer
tube holder and EDTA tubes. The blood samples were immediately
prepared after collection. The characteristics of the seven HI from are
indicated in Supplementary Table S1.
Preanalytical work-up
Plasma is deﬁned as a liquid isolated from blood after precluding
blood clotting with an anticoagulating agent. To do so, various pre-
analytical conditions might be used with a necessary removal of cells by
using a centrifugation step. We herein employed different procedures
previously detailed in our previous paper (Roch et al., 2021). Besides, the
pre-analytical conditions for all blood samples strictly followed the
guidelines we reported (Meddeb et al., 2019a). Among these, in order to
measure properly cirDNA concentrations, we applied an immediate
isolation of plasma following blood draw, a less than 4 h delay between
blood drawing and plasma preparation, an examination of plasma
aspect after the ﬁrst centrifugation step, no delay before the second
centrifugation
step,
and
an
assessment
of
blood
cell
DNA
contamination by determining the DNA Integrity Index (DII).
Standard preparation protocol (SPP) for cirDNA
analysis (cirDNA-SPP)
We used a standard centrifugation protocol previously validated
(Chiu et al., 2001; El Messaoudi et al., 2013) to isolate plasma from
EDTA tubes handled with a strict respect of pre-established
guidelines (Meddeb et al., 2019a). Brieﬂy, blood samples were
consecutively centrifuged at 1,200 g (low-speed centrifugation,
LS) and 16,000 g (high-speed centrifugation, HS) at 4°C for
10 min with each subsequent supernatant being used to obtain
our plasma preparation. QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen)
was then applied on 200 µL of this plasma preparation to extract
cirDNA in a ﬁnal elution volume of 80 µL, with an immediate
storage of DNA extracts obtained at −20°C until use. To examine
cirDNA origins, we also used a 0.22 µm Polysulfone membrane ﬁlter
to set a ﬁltration step (Al Amir Dache et al., 2020) and a −20°C
freezing step between LS and HS.
Plasma preparation without platelet activation
(PPw/oPA)
To preclude platelet activation during plasma isolation, we used a
protocol previously detailed in our previous paper (Roch et al., 2021).
Brieﬂy, we collected fresh blood in dedicated tubes with a subsequent
isolation of plasma through differential centrifugations: two consecutive
steps at 200 g, a third centrifugation at 300 g, the subsequent addition of
an anticoagulant solution containing prostaglandin E1 to the plasma,
and three further centrifugations at 1,100, 2,500 and 16,000 g, all
centrifugations steps being carried out for 10 min at room temperature.
Differential centrifugation and ﬁltration (F) of
plasma
The different plasma preparations used here are detailed in our
previous paper (Roch et al., 2021). Brieﬂy, we examined different
approaches to prepare plasma from each blood sample, with
variations considering centrifugation speed and/or F. After an initial
1,200 g centrifugation step, the isolated plasma was split in four equal
volumes: (i), the ﬁrst aliquot (LS) was not submitted to any additional
treatment and considered as a control; (ii) the second one was ﬁltered
(LS+F) with a 0.22 µm ﬁlter; (iii), an additional centrifugation at
16,000 g was performed for the third one (LS+HS); and (iv), the last
one was centrifuged at 16,000 g centrifugation after being stored
at −20°C (LS+freezing+HS). The cirDNA was then extracted from
the abovementioned plasma preparations and then analyzed by Q-PCR.
Second, the plasma was isolated at 400 g with Ficoll gradient.
The supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4°C,
(Micro Star microcentrifuge, VWR), then further centrifuged at
40,000 g for 1 h at 4°C, and ﬁnally centrifuged at 200,000 g for 2 h at
4°C (Beckman MLA-130 Ultracentrifuge
Rotor).
After each
centrifugation step, an aliquot was performed and the cirDNA
extracted from supernatants for Q-PCR analysis.
Quantiﬁcation of cir-mtDNA and cir-nDNA
by Q-PCR
The Q-PCR ampliﬁcation protocol used here is exhaustively
detailed in our previous paper (Roch et al., 2021) and followed
MIQE guidelines (Bustin et al., 2009). Every sample was submitted
to a triplicate measurement of cirDNA concentrations.
Frontiers in Genetics

Pisareva et al.
10.3389/fgene.2023.1104732
Brieﬂy, Q-PCR ampliﬁcations were performed with a 25 μL-
total reaction volume. Thermal cycling started with a denaturation
step, followed by 40 repeated cycles of 10 s at 90°C and 30 s at 60°C.
Melting curves were obtained through a gradual increase of the
temperature from 55°C to 90°C. DIFI human colorectal cancer cell
line was used to calibrate the quantiﬁcations and check the efﬁciency
of each pair of primers for which an additional negative control step
was set. The primers used targeted cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA
through previously validated wild type sequences in KRAS gene
(67 bp and 320 bp) (Mouliere et al., 2013; Mouliere et al., 2014) and
in the MT-CO3 gene (67 bp and 310 bp) (Meddeb et al., 2019a;
Tanos et al., 2020). We ascertained sample concentrations from
triplicate measurements through the extrapolation of our standard
curves.
Preparation of sequencing libraries
Both DSP and SSP were prepared. SSP allows the integration
of ssDNA and dsDNA in the library. DSP libraries were prepared
with the NEB Next® Ultra™ II kit (New England Biolabs). SSP
libraries were prepared with the Swift ACCEL-NGS® 1S PLUS kit
(Swift Biosciences). For both preparations, a minimum of 1 ng of
cirDNA was engaged without fragmentation, and each kit
providers’
recommendations
were
followed.
For
quality
control
purpose,
cirDNA
extracts
were
controlled
by
Bioanalyzer
capillary
electrophoresis
and
quantiﬁed
by
Q-PCR. For DSP, repaired A-tailed fragments were submitted
to
a
ligation
with
Illumina
paired-end
(PE)
adaptor
oligonucleotides. A puriﬁcation was then applied by solid-
phase
reversible
immobilization
(SPRI),
followed
by
an
enrichment by 11 PCR cycles with unique dual index primers
indexing, and another SPRI puriﬁcation. For SSP, to convert all
DNA into single strands, a ﬁrst step of heat denaturation was
accomplished. Through the use of an adaptase, this protocol
enables the simultaneous binding of an adapter to the end of each
single-stranded fragment and the lengthening of the 3’ end of this
fragment. Subsequently, a primer extension synthesized the
complementary strand, followed by a SPRI puriﬁcation, the
ligation of a second adapter at the other end, and another step
of SPRI puriﬁcation. An enrichment of the product was then
performed by 11 PCR cycles, followed by a ﬁnal SPRI
puriﬁcation. An adjustment of the SPRI puriﬁcation was
operated to keep the small fragments around 70 bp of insert
for both types of preparation. Lastly, a precise quantiﬁcation by
Q-PCR was applied to the libraries to be sequenced, to ensure
that the appropriate DNA quantity was loaded to the Illumina
sequencer, and that a minimum of 1.5 million of clusters would
be obtained.
The calculation of each fragment size’s frequency, expressed in
%, was carried out using the ratio of the sequenced reads to the total
reads obtained in the library. The fragment size distribution length
unit was base pairs (bp) when using DSP-sequencing (DSP-S), and
nucleotides (nt) when using SSP-sequencing (SSP-S). To allow the
comparison of data from both DSP-S and SSP-S, the size or size
range were then expressed as bp (nt).
Note, these are PCR-free libraries, with no initial PCR targeted
sequencing performed, given our knowledge on the previously
described high cirDNA fragmentation showing an appropriate
mean fragment size range for whole genome sequencing (WGS),
from 150 to 160 bp (Sanchez et al., 2018).

A
NextSeq
500
Sequencing
System
or
NovaSeq
6,000 Sequencing System (Illumina) were used to sequence all
libraries as PE 100 reads. Image analysis and base calling was
achieved through the use of Illumina Real-Time Analysis, using
default parameters. A cut of the individual barcoded PE reads was
performed with Cutadapt v1.10, removing the adapters to discard
trimmed reads shorter than 20 bp. An alignment of the trimmed
FASTQ ﬁles with the human reference genome (Genome Reference
Consortium Human Build 38, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc/
human) was obtained using the Maximum Entropy Method
algorithm in the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner v0.7.15. The insert
sizes were then extracted from the aligned bam ﬁles with the
Template Length column for all pairs of reads with an insert size
between 0 and 1,000 bp.
The ratio of the number of reads at each fragment size to the
total number of fragments from 30 to 1,000 bp (nt) was used to
calculate the frequency of each fragment size separated by 1 bp or
nt. Relying respectively on the presence of dsDNA or ssDNA, the
size proﬁles generated by DSP-S or SSP-S were respectively
expressed in bp and nt as a fragment size unit. Note, the
fragment sizes are offset by 3 bp (nt) for the two methods,
which
is
consistent
with
damaged
or
non-ﬂush
input
molecules,
whose
true
endpoints
are
more
faithfully
represented in single-stranded libraries.
DNA libraries and sequencing were performed by IntegraGen
SA (Evry, France). Under the aforementioned technical conditions,
the limits of detection by sequencing are estimated to be 30 bp (nt) at
the lower end, and nearly 1,000 bp (nt) at the upper end. Sequencing
of plasma-extracted cirDNA was performed from either DSP or SSP
in plasma as previously reported (Sanchez et al., 2021).
Statistics and drawings / statistical analysis
We used GraphPad Prism software V6.01 to fulﬁll statistical
analysis, calculation and log transformation of relevant data. Means
were compared with a Student’s t-test. Statistical signiﬁcance of data
was set with a two-sided p-value under 0.05. Signiﬁcant p-values are
indicated in the different ﬁgures by *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01; ***p <
0.001; ****p < 0.0001. Figures of cirDNA size proﬁle as performed by
LP-WGS were drawn using R studio.
Results
We ﬁrst explored cir-mtDNA’s structural features using the
analytical strategy of combined Q-PCR and LP-WGS analysis, from
both DSP and SSP. This successfully provided a full determination of
the fractional distribution of cir-nDNA over a wide size range
(Sanchez et al., 2018; Sanchez et al., 2021). Therefore, we applied
this strategy to compare the cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA size proﬁles.

Low-pass WGS-based size proﬁle of cirDNA,
from plasma prepared with the cirDNA
standard protocol
In HI, the mean number of reads for cir-mtDNA was 79
(range 24–207) for DSP-S and 119 (range 25–277) for SSP-S; the
mean number of reads for cir-nDNA was 1,434,487 (range
1,079,717- 1,611,205) for DSP-S and 1,007,070 (range 708,192-
1,299,291) for SSP-S (Supplementary Table S2). The DSP-S and
SSP-S ratios of the mean number of cir-mtDNA reads over cir-
nDNA reads were 0.006% and 0.012% in HI (Supplementary
Table S2). Because of the low read number of cir-mtDNA, we
presented size proﬁles with histogram values at each fragment
size up to 1,000 bp (nt).
Mitochondrial circulating DNA size proﬁle
The seven HI size proﬁles obtained by DSP-S and SSP-S are
pasted over each other in Figures 1A, B, respectively. Using DSP-S,
relative frequencies distributed from 55 to 425 bp (Figure 1A), with a
sharp increase up to 120 bp, a subsequent progressive decrease with
no fragments above 425 bp, and a slightly higher number of
fragments from 90 to 260 bp. Using SSP-S, relative frequencies
distributed from 50 to 475 nt (Figure 1B), with a sharp increase
up to 80 nt, followed by a progressive decrease in the number of
fragments. Two distinct populations appeared in the proﬁles
obtained by SSP-S: one monomodal population from 50 to
150 nt, and a population smear from 150 to 475 nt, with no
fragments above 475 nt (Figure 1B). Cir-mtDNA size proﬁles
appeared to be homogeneous among the seven HI, both for DSP-

S and SSP-S (Figures 1A, B). The majority of detected fragments in
HI DSP-S mean size proﬁles distributed from 90 to 260 bp (77.9% of
total fragments), with the number of fragments sharply increasing
from 90 to 120 bp, peaking at 120 bp, and decreasing slowly in the
range beyond that (Figure 1C). The majority of detected fragments
in HI SSP-S mean size proﬁles distributed from 50 to 150 nt (74.4%
of total fragments), with the number of fragments sharply increasing
from 50 to 80 nt, peaking at 80 nt, sharply decreasing from 80 to
150 nt, then decreasing slowly beyond that (Figure 1D). Differences
emerged when the DSP-S and SSP-S mean size proﬁles were
compared (Figures 1E, F). First, DSP-S mean size proﬁles
distributed on a slightly shorter range (90–425 bp) than SSP-S
(50–475 nt). Maximal values as determined by both methods
ranged from about 100 to 150 bp for DSP-S and from 70 to
100 nt for SSP-S. Thus, SSP-S detected a higher number of low-
sized sequences with a high mean frequency of fragments between
50 and 120 nt (61.0% of total fragments), while DSP-S showed a low
number of fragments in this range (16.7% of total fragments).
Comparison of mitochondrial and nuclear
circulating DNA size proﬁles
Cir-mtDNA and cir-nDNA DSP-S mean size proﬁles of HI
ranged from 55 to 425 bp and 85 to 420 bp, respectively (Figures 2A,
B). The DSP-S cir-mtDNA proﬁle of HI exhibited a major
monomodal population, mostly ranging between 90 and 260 bp,
peaking at 120 bp, and a population appearing as a smear above
260 bp (21.0% of total fragments). The DSP-S cir-nDNA proﬁle of
HI had a major population between 85 and 260 bp (89.2% of total
fragments), peaking at 166 bp (2.5% of total fragments); a minor
population was also detectable between 261 and 420 bp (10.5% of
total fragments), with no fragment detected above 420 bp. Periodic
sub-peaks every 10 bp from 102 to 152 bp were detectable with cir-
nDNA in contrast to cir-mtDNA. Cir-mtDNA and cir-nDNA SSP-S
fragments size proﬁle of HI ranged respectively from 50 to 475 nt
and 40 to 400 nt (Figures 2C, D). The cir-mtDNA SSP-S proﬁle of
HI had a major monomodal population between 50 and 150 nt,
peaking at 80 nt, while there was a slowly decreasing population
smear from 151 to 475 nt (25.2% of total fragments). Cir-nDNA
SSP-S mean size proﬁle had a major population between 45 and
260 nt (96.3% of total fragments), peaking at 166 nt, corresponding
to nearly 2.0% of total fragments. The number of fragments
plateaued between 70 and 120 bp at nearly 0.4% of total
fragments. A very small population was observed between
261 and 400 nt (3.4% of total fragments). Periodic sub-peaks
every 10 nt from 53 to 144 nt only existed with cir-nDNA.
We observed a nearly 40-fold lower frequency of cir-mtDNA
fragments <90 bp with DSP-S (mean+/-SD = 0.9+/-1.2%) than with
SSP-S (mean+/-SD = 33.5+/-4.9%) (Supplementary Table S3A and
Supplementary Table S3B). Additionally, the frequencies
of
fragments above 200 bp (nt) were homogenous among DSP-S

(Supplementary Table S3A) and SSP-S cir-mtDNA size proﬁles
(Supplementary Table S3B). However, the frequency of fragments
above 200 bp (nt) was 3-fold higher with DSP-S (mean+/-SD =
38.1+/-4.2%) compared with SSP-S (mean+/-SD = 12.3+/-4.0%),
meaning a higher number of fragments above 200 bp (nt) were
obtained with DSP-S, compared with SSP-S. The ratio of the
frequency
below
90 bp
over
the
frequency
above
200 bp
(Frequency <90)/(Frequency >200) was extremely homogenous
among both DSP-S and SSP-S proﬁles. Nevertheless, this ratio
was 134-fold lower with DSP-S (mean+/-SD = 0.02+/-0.03) than
with SSP-S (mean+/-SD = 3.3+/-2.1).
We observed a very low amount of cir-mtDNA fragments of
short size suggesting that most of the cir-mtDNA is poorly
fragmented and appearing longer than ~1,000 bp, the readout
limit of this LP-WGS method. Since we found that conventional
plasma preparation results in in vitro platelet activation (Roch et al.,
2021) and consequently to mitochondria extracellular release
(Meddeb et al., 2019a; Al Amir Dache et al., 2020), we used a
plasma procedure precluding platelet activation. This enabled us to
quantitatively compare the forms and structures of plasma extracted
DNA ﬂoating in the blood circulation. In order to estimate the
cirDNA various structural forms, plasma fractions were subjected to
physical examination.
Physical examination of plasma prepared by
various methods
Cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA extracts from both preparation
protocol,
respectively
cirDNA-SPP
and
PPw/oPA
were
partitioned to elucidate the fractions of the various cirDNA
structural forms. During this plasma preparation process, a
complementary step with LS alone or with a subsequent F was
also added to potentially evaluate the presence of particles. It should
be noted that two of the seven subjects had not enough plasma to
perform the abovementioned experiments, described in Figure 3 and
Figure 4.
Effect of the use of HS, F and freezing step on
plasma preparation (cirDNA-SPP)
As described in our previous paper (Roch et al., 2021), cir-
mtDNA supernatant concentrations were signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by
F and HS, applied after LS (LS+F or LS+HS), and freezing,
performed between LS and HS (LS+freezing+HS). Both LS+F and
LS+HS led to a signiﬁcant decrease, compared to supernatant from
LS (Supplementary Table S4A), while freezing resulted in a
signiﬁcant increase (12-fold) of the cir-mtDNA amount in
LS+F+HS supernatant, compared with LS+HS.
Supernatant derived cir-nDNA mean concentrations following
LS, LS+F, LS+HS and LS+freezing+HS were 5.28, 4.53, 7.25 and
9.27 ng/mL, respectively (Supplementary Table S4A). No signiﬁcant
effect was observed on cir-nDNA level due to either F or HS. Adding
a freezing step between LS and HS increased by 28% the cir-nDNA
concentration,
which
was
not
statistically
signiﬁcant.
The
proportions of cir-mtDNA mean concentrations among the total
cirDNA mean concentrations were 19.5%, 0.3%, 0.1% and 0.9%
following LS, LS+F, LS+HS and LS+freezing+HS, respectively
(Supplementary
Table
S4A).
All
concentration
values
are
described in Supplementary Table S4A.
Effect of the use of HS and F on plasma preparation
(PPw/oPA)
Cir-mtDNA concentrations following LS, LS+F, LS+HS and
LS+HS+F were 0.019, 0.004, 0.005, and 0.003 ng/mL, respectively.
The obtained values after F and HS of the plasma following LS
showed an 80% (p = 0.012) and 75.7% decrease (p = 0.010) of cir-
mtDNA levels (Figures 3A, B). By contrast, cir-nDNA level was not
signiﬁcantly altered by F or HS (Figures 3A, B) with concentrations
following LS, LS+F, LS+HS and LS+HS+F of 3.55, 3.51, 3.28 and
3.28 ng/mL, respectively. Following LS, LS+F, LS+HS and LS+F+HS,
the fractions of cir-mtDNA copies among the total cirDNA copies
were 0.5, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.1%, respectively. All concentration values are
described in Supplementary Table S4B.

Estimation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) associated
cir-mtDNA proportion
While the plasma preparation without platelet activation
provides highly qualitative information, its stringency, such as
the
numerous
centrifugation
steps,
precludes
accurate
quantitative assessment of the cir-mtDNA. As a ﬁrst step, we
therefore used a Ficoll plasma preparation, and performed
subsequent 16,000, 40,000 and 200,000 g centrifugations of the
respective supernatant, which found about 3.7 × 106, 9.2 × 105
and 1.1 × 105 copy number of mtDNA per mL, respectively. As
for cir-nDNA, we found 1,001, 705 and 165 copy number of nDNA
per
mL,
respectively.
Considering
cir-mtDNA,
a
signiﬁcant
statistical difference was only observed between the groups of
plasma following the 16,000 g and the 40,000 g and between
those following the 16,000 g and the 200,000 g centrifugations
(p = 0.04, Figure 4), while such a difference only appeared
between
those
following
the
16,000 g
and
the
200,000 g
centrifugations for cir-nDNA (p < 0.0001, Figure 4). From the
total amount of mtDNA previously present in the 16,000 g
supernatant, 24.3% and 4.2% of cir-mtDNA remained in the
40,000 g and 200,000 g supernatant, whereas 63.7% and 10.6% of
cir-nDNA remained in the 40,000 g and 200,000 g supernatant
(Supplementary Table S4C). The proportions of cir-mtDNA
copies among the total cirDNA copies were 0.4, 0.1 and 0.1%
following the 16,000 g, 40,000 g and 200,000 g centrifugation,
respectively.

Discussion
Beyond quantitative observations (Meddeb et al., 2019a;
Otandault et al., 2020; Roch et al., 2021), cir-nDNA analysis has
beneﬁted greatly from the understanding of its structural features
acquired from their fragment size proﬁle or fragmentomics. Works
from Ellinger et al. (Ellinger et al., 2008) and Diehl et al. (Diehl et al.,
2005) revealed that fragments may be of a size lower than 180 bp;
that was previously thought to be the lowest size (Jahr et al., 2001), as
it corresponds to that existing in a mononucleosome plus linker.
Subsequently, we were the ﬁrst to show that cirDNA is mostly highly
fragmented, with a signiﬁcant part of those fragments being of sizes
down to 60 bp (Mouliere et al., 2013). Subsequent works using WGS
analysis conﬁrmed this in greater detail (Fan et al., 2010;
Chandrananda et al., 2015; Ivanov et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2015;
Snyder et al., 2016). In addition, WGS-assisted fragmentomics
revealed nucleosome footprints, which indicated that detected
short fragments (30–400 bp) derive from the nucleosome around
which cirDNA is packed and relatively stabilized in the blood
compartment (Ivanov et al., 2015; Snyder et al., 2016; Sanchez
et al., 2021). Furthermore, Shendure’s team (Snyder et al., 2016)
inferred tissue of origins from nucleosome occupancy as determined
by WGS. We also described how cirDNA distribution in cancer
patient
plasma
is
mostly
represented
(67–80%)
by
mono-
nucleosome associated cir-nDNA (Sanchez et al., 2021). In
addition,
Q-PCR
assisted
data
on
cirDNA
distribution
corresponded to WGS performed using SSP-S rather than DSP-S.
This allowed the harmonization of data obtained from Q-PCR and
WGS, since both SSP-S and Q-PCR use ssDNA as a template
(Sanchez et al., 2018; Sanchez et al., 2021). A procedure
combining LP-WGS and Q-PCR points to the possibility of
identifying all kinds of nicks on fragments under 1,000 bp, and
may also provide clues about potential cirDNA stabilizing structures
in blood. Moreover, by adding a Q-PCR approach, we have given
ourselves the possibility of learning more about fragments over
1,000 bp, and thus extending our comprehension of the size proﬁle
and the level of fragmentation of cir-nDNA (Sanchez et al., 2018;
Sanchez et al., 2021). As previously demonstrated (Sanchez et al.,
2021), LP-WGS allows the inference of the presence of blunt or
jagged dsDNA by comparing DSP-S and SSP-S. This process has
also provided the following observations: (i), jagged dsDNA
appeared by far the most present cirDNA structural forms; (ii),
the lowest cirDNA fragment size is about 70 bp; and (iii), this might

be due to the low hybridization forces of the lower-sized jagged
fragments leading to their peeling off from histone/nucleosome
particles (Sanchez et al., 2021). Altogether, our data suggest that
the proportion of cir-nDNA inserted in mono-nucleosomes, di-
nucleosomes, and chromatin of higher molecular size (>1,000 bp) in
HI ranges from 67% to 80%, 9% to 12%, and 8% to 21%, respectively
(Sanchez et al., 2021).
Considering how useful this combined analytical approach
had proved, we then applied it in an investigation of cir-mtDNA
structural features. To this end, we used the cirDNA-SPP and a
stringent clinically validated DNA extraction process, and
followed our previously published guidelines (Meddeb et al.,
2019a). As we observed with cir-nDNA from LP-WGS, cir-
mtDNA size proﬁles appeared homogenous and reproducible
in the plasma of HI, whether detected by DSP-S or SSP-S
(Figure 1); and in both cases, an overwhelming majority of
fragments were less than 400 bp in size. This suggests that this
population of short fragments is the result either of degradation
by-products or of some means of cir-mtDNA protection.
However, we found periodic distribution neither with DSP-S
nor with SSP-S, while the DSP-S and the SSP-S mean size proﬁles
differed signiﬁcantly (Figure 1). With SSP-S, we detected a higher
number of short fragments in the 50–120 nt interval, an earlier
peak at 80 nt, and a faster decrease of mean percent of fragments
after 80 nt, as compared with DSP-S. DSP-S showed a higher
proportion of fragments in the 120–200 bp interval, with a later
and lower peak, around 120 bp, and a subsequent slower decrease
of mean percent of fragments after 120 bp. The signiﬁcant
differences between DSP-S and SSP-S may reveal a structural
difference, since observation of a short population implies the
protection of DNA strands by a stabilizing structure, as observed
in cir-nDNA associated with nucleosomes. The clear differences
existing between DSP-S and SSP-S proﬁles led us to believe that
shorter ssDNA fragments appeared following SSP-S from jagged
dsDNA, with at least one nick in one DNA strand still bound to
the structure protecting the DNA from nuclease attack.
Only a few existing reports contributed to characterize cir-
mtDNA structure. Chiu et al. (Chandrananda et al., 2015)
initiated efforts towards this goal, and indirectly showed that
cir-mtDNA may consist of both particle-associated and non-
particle-associated forms of mtDNA in plasma. By PE sequencing
analysis, a report (Chandrananda et al., 2015) indicated that
microbial and mtDNA are exposed to similar degradation
processes, having observed that the fragmentation proﬁles of
microbial and mtDNA in plasma were highly similar. Like Jiang
et al. (Jiang et al., 2015), they also reported that cir-mtDNA size
distribution is consistently
shorter than cir-nDNA. Since
mtDNA cannot be packed as nDNA with histones within
nucleosome, both stated that cir-mtDNA is more susceptible
to enzymatic degradation, given that its size proﬁle reﬂects traces
of wide range-sized mtDNA under dynamic degradation.
Furthermore, Chandrananda et al. found that SSP-S is more
effective
than
DSP-S
at
recovering
bacterial,
viral
and
mitochondrial cirDNA (Chandrananda et al., 2015). These
results may challenge the common paradigm, which considers
fragments of cir-mtDNA below 400 bp as consisting only of
degradation products (Chandrananda et al., 2015). Burhnam
et al. later conﬁrmed this statement (Burnham et al., 2016).
Consequently, our ﬁndings lead to a profound revision of
previous assumptions regarding the signiﬁcance of the cir-
mtDNA amounts detected in our and other previous works
(Chiu et al., 2003; Jiang et al., 2015; Meddeb et al., 2019a;
Bezdan et al., 2020; Grabuschnig et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Liu
et al., 2020; Hägg et al., 2021). First, it can no longer be considered
valid to examine short cir-mtDNA fragments (in particular under
1,000 bp) using DNA fragmentation index as determined by Q-PCR
(Ellinger et al., 2009; Zonta et al., 2015; Meddeb et al., 2019b; Tanos
et al., 2020) or using WGS (Chandrananda et al., 2015; Jiang et al.,
2015)) when considering the overall cir-mtDNA population, since it
accounts for a very tiny part of the cir-mtDNA amount. Despite
their low plasma content, mtDNA blood degradation products
might nonetheless be relevant when considering differential
enzymatic activity which may occur in certain physiological or
pathological conditions, as suggested for cir-nDNA (Serpas et al.,
2019; Sanchez et al., 2021).
Uncertainty as to the nature of the short cir-mtDNA fragments
population nonetheless appears of minor importance, since its
proportion to the total cirDNA fragments is very low: (i), the cir-
mtDNA mean number corresponded to 0.006% and 0.012% of the
total cirDNA fragments (Supplementary Table S2), when using
DSP-S and SSP-S, respectively; (ii), there are nearly 50,000-fold
more copies of the mitochondrial genome in plasma (Al Amir Dache
et al., 2020), which accounts for 10–25% of the total cirDNA mass
content; and (iii), the DII as determined by Q-PCR showed that
nearly all cir-mtDNA is over 310 bp (Roch et al., 2021). Inside cells,
mtDNA is bound with mitochondrial transcription factor A
(TFAM), constituting nucleoprotein complexes called nucleoids.
As previously published (Bogenhagen, 2012), the copy number of
mtDNA contained in a single nucleoid may vary between 1.4 and
7.5, depending on the cell type and the method used. TFAM are
protein factors that may theoretically also protect cir-mtDNA in
blood circulation. However, these types of nucleoprotein complexes
are sedimenting following 100,000/200,000 g centrifugation speed,
and therefore could represent at the most 4.4% of total cir-mtDNA,
as shown here. These complexes are thus to be considered as a very
minor part of cir-mtDNA and could not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence our
results.
In contrast, cir-nDNA is highly fragmented with a DII showing a
proportion of the number of detected fragments above 320 bp
ranging from 10 to 20% (Meddeb et al., 2019a; Sanchez et al.,
2021). Since practically no cir-mtDNA fragments were detected
between 310 bp and 1,000 bp (Figure 1), which is the practical upper
limit of read-out in LP-WGS sizing using either DSP-S or SSP-S, we
infer that most cir-mtDNA fragments are over 1,000 bp. Our data
converge with that of several other studies. For instance, using a
Q-PCR-based assay, Ellinger et al. reported a plasma mtDNA
integrity between 0.5 and 1.0 (Ellinger et al., 2009). Data
obtained in this study conﬁrmed our previous observation that
the cir-mtDNA DII is always close to 1; this indicates that cir-
mtDNA is not or very poorly fragmented (Thierry and El
Messaoudi, 2015). Note, we previously observed a much higher
stability of cir-mtDNA compared to cir-nDNA extracted from
serum-containing media of cultured cells (Otandault et al., 2020).
Our postulate is that cir-mtDNA is either unfragmented when
included in mitochondria (free or encapsulated in EVs) or very
fragmented as observed in our WGS-based data.

The three main methods available for determining DNA
fragment length are LP-WGS, Q-PCR, and Agilent capillary
electrophoresis; however, these are limited in respect to (i) the
practical upper limit of read-out around 1,000 bp (LP-WGS); (ii)
the
general
low
accuracy
and
precision
(capillary
electrophoresis);
and
(iii),
the
capacity
to
compare
size
fragments over 1,000 bp (Q-PCR). In order to decipher the
major structural forms of the detected cir-mtDNA, we carried
out a variety of experiments, based on physical examination and
various plasma preparations. This led to a number of striking
observations.
First,
we
observed
that,
compared
to
the
consecutive two-step centrifugation, the frozen storage step
between LS and HS, as conventionally performed in the
cirDNA-SPP, led to an increase by at least 10-fold of cir-
mtDNA plasma concentration, whereas similar levels of cir-
nDNA concentration were found (Supplementary Table S4A).
It should be noted that very recent work has reported similar
observations (Wong et al., 2021). This means that freezing
disrupts some structures in a way that leads to the release of
cir-mtDNA but not cir-nDNA. Second, HS dramatically reduced
the resulting plasma cir-mtDNA concentration by about 99%, as
compared to the 1,200 g plasma supernatant, whereas both
supernatants revealed equivalent levels of cir-nDNA (Figures
3A, B, Supplementary Table S4A). This means that cir-mtDNA
are mostly contained in or associated with structures whose
densities correspond to that of cell organelles, membrane
debris or apoptotic bodies. Third, ﬁltration of the plasma
supernatant
obtained
following
a
1,200 g
centrifugation
resulted in a loss of nearly 99% of detected cir-mtDNA,
whereas no signiﬁcant change was observed for cir-nDNA
(Figures 3A, B, Supplementary Table S4A). This means that
most of the cir-mtDNA are associated with structures whose
size is over 0.22 µm. Note, our observations point to the existence
of particles containing mtDNA in the circulation, as it has been
previously indicated by plasma ﬁltrates (Chiu et al., 2003; Malkin
et al., 2022). In addition, our data agree with Arance-Criado’s
observation (Arance-Criado et al., 2020), in HI, of a 99.4%
decrease of cir-mtDNA following the HS step using a protocol
equivalent to the cirDNA-SPP (Supplementary Table S4A).
Taken together, these data suggest that nearly all detected cir-
mtDNA derive from larger or denser biological structures, in
contrast to cir-nDNA.
Aside from circulating cell-free mitochondria (cir-exMT) origin (Al
Amir Dache et al., 2020), plasma-derived mtDNA could originate from
other structures: remaining cells, in association with cell debris or
membranes, mitochondria, or EVs (Malkin et al., 2022). While
exosomes, and apoptotic bodies could be considered as EVs, we
arbitrarily differentiated here four types of vesicles: large EVs, small
EVs, exosomes, and apoptotic bodies. They may be differentiated based
upon their biogenesis, release pathways, content, and function (Doyle and
Wang, 2019), and may show signiﬁcant differences in size. Microvesicles,
exosomes and apoptotic bodies typically range from 100 nm up to
1 μm, <200 nm and >1 µm in diameter, respectively (Doyle and
Wang,
2019).
Differential
centrifugations
allow
their
isolation:
apoptotic bodies at a g-force of approximately 2,000 g; microvesicles
at
10,000–30,000 g;
and
exosomes
by
ultracentrifugation
at
100,000–200,000 g. We may assume that EVs could contain either
extracellular mitochondria (exMT) or fragmented mtDNA genome.
Using sequencing analysis, a previous report demonstrated the
presence of only intact full mitochondrial genomes in the plasma
cirDNA fraction (Newell et al., 2018), conﬁrming our previous
observation (Al Amir Dache et al., 2020). They speculate that
mtDNA
could
be
protected
from
degradation
by
circulating
nucleases due to either EVs encapsulation or the circular nature of
mtDNA potentially delaying its degradation (Newell et al., 2018). This
study does not account for mtDNA platelet origin, however, as they used
an SPP equivalent process. Based upon our observation that the
proportion of cir-mtDNA of size below 1,000 bp is very weak (Roch
et al., 2021), we infer that fragmented mtDNA between 1,000 bp and
16,000 bp, the approximate mitochondria full length genome, is barely
associated with EVs (<0.5%). In contrast, our data based on the PPw/
oPA revealed that 1.7% of the cir-mtDNA is associated with exosomes,
and 18.4% mainly associated with small EVs. Thus, when taking together
fragmentomics and plasma fractionation data, we infer that a fraction, at
least, of EVs contains mitochondrial full length circular DNA or
mitochondria
particles
that
could
be
internally
or
externally
associated with EVs. Thus, we do not preclude the possibility that
mitochondria particle free mtDNA may exist in blood circulation in
association with EVs, as reported previously (Malkin et al., 2022).
However, its amount corresponds to a minor fraction of the total cir-
mtDNA. In previous work (Al Amir Dache et al., 2020), our
transmission electronic microscopy examinations showed no evidence
of exMT encapsulated in or associated with bilayer phospholipidic
vesicles or membranes. Moreover, our study combining LP-WGS
and Q-PCR analysis showed that fragmented mtDNA of size below
1,000 bp exist in extremely small quantities (<1%, (Roch et al., 2021)).
Consequently, our data associated with others (Chiu et al., 2003; Newell
et al., 2018; Al Amir Dache et al., 2020) show that mtDNA detected in
plasma correspond quasi-exclusively to cir-exMT.
By combining speciﬁc DNA quantiﬁcation of cirDNA extracts
deriving from plasma preparations avoiding platelet activation
submitted
to
differential
centrifugation
and/or
physical
examination, our work reveals profound differences between cir-
mtDNA and cir-nDNA in terms of size distribution, structure and
mechanism of release. Thus, our data suggest that cir-nDNA is
associated with ~8.6% of large structures (apoptotic bodies, large
EVs, cell debris. . .), ~27.7% in chromatin and small EVs and ~63.7%
in exosomes, protein complexes and oligo- or mono-nucleosomes
(Table 1). This was concordant with a previous report (Neuberger
et al., 2021). In contrast, cir-mtDNA appeared preponderantly
associated with extracellular mitochondria either free or in large
EVs fraction (~75.7%), while being associated with small EVs
(~18.4%), and with exosomes or protein complexes (~5.9%)
(Table 1).
While the plasma prepared without platelet activation contained
much less cir-mtDNA (67-fold less), exMT nonetheless still
represents the preponderant fraction of the total detected cir-
mtDNA amount, compared to mtDNA containing EVs (Table 1).
The paucity of the cir-mtDNA encapsulating microparticles/
exosomes (Table 1) clearly conﬁrms the need for speciﬁc
isolation methods for their examination.
We believe that certain controversies in previous literature arose
from improper conclusions based on a confusion between cir-
mtDNA and cir-nDNA, and the belief that at least part of their
release derive from the same mechanisms. Consequently, we
propose that future studies should systematically include a

measurement of both entities, to circumscribe their respective
physiological impact and diagnostic power. By comparison with
cir-nDNA, the structural features of cir-mtDNA appear more
complex and diverse. This is principally due to the release of
exMT in interstitial milieu or blood circulation from various cell
types, and due to the lack of stabilizing mitochondrial components
that
would
enable
protection
from
extracellular
nuclease
degradation. Our work suggests the preponderance of cir-nDNA
in mononucleosomes and of cir-mtDNA in exMT, highlighting their
profound differences as regards their circulating structural forms.
While the pre-analytics currently used for cir-nDNA appear
satisfactory (Meddeb et al., 2019a), our data highlight the need
for speciﬁc pre-analytics for cir-mtDNA. In addition, cir-nDNA and
especially cir-mtDNA are both associated with different structures
that might have signiﬁcant differences in their respective diagnostic
potentials. It is therefore necessary to better extend our knowledge of
cirDNA structures of origin, and to standardize the preparation of
biological material, in order to fully determine and optimize the
promise of cirDNA in clinical and routine settings.
