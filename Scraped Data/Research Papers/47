Abstract: This study proposed using enamel surface texture and thickness for the objective detection
and monitoring of erosive tooth wear (ETW), comparing them to the standard subjective Basic Erosive
Wear Evaluation (BEWE). Thirty-two subjects (n = 597 teeth) were enrolled in this longitudinal
observational clinical study. Enamel thickness (by cross-polarization optical coherence tomography,
CP-OCT) and 3D dental microwear parameters, i.e., area-scale fractal complexity (Asfc), anisotropy
(Str), and roughness (Sa) (by white-light scanning confocal proﬁlometry), were obtained from buccal
surfaces. Buccal, occlusal, and lingual surfaces were scored for BEWE and the maximum score per
tooth (BEWEMax) was determined at baseline and 12 months (M12). Data outcome relationships
were evaluated (alpha = 0.05). Enamel thickness decreased (p < 0.001), BEWE scores, Sa, and Str
increased (p < 0.001), while Asfc did not change at M12. Baseline BEWEBuccal correlated strongly
with BEWEMax (r = 0.86, p < 0.001) and moderately with BEWELingual (r = 0.42, p < 0.001), but not
with enamel thickness (r = 0.03, p = 0.43). Change (∆) in surface texture outcomes correlated poorly
but signiﬁcantly with ∆BEWEBuccal (r = −0.15–0.16, p < 0.001) and did not correlate with ∆enamel
thickness (r = 0.02–0.09, p > 0.06). Teeth with BEWE progression revealed a greater increase in ∆Sa
and ∆Str. These ﬁndings suggest that enamel surface roughness can potentially determine ETW
severity, and CP-OCT may be relevant for clinically monitoring enamel thickness.

1. Introduction
Erosive tooth wear (ETW) is a dental condition that results in loss of tooth structure
as a consequence of chemo-mechanical wear processes [1]. Acids that are present in

the oral cavity from intrinsic (gastric) and/or extrinsic (dietary) sources [2] can soften
exposed enamel and dentin surfaces and make them vulnerable to wear from the abrasive
forces of mastication and toothbrushing. Given the irreversible nature of ETW, tooth form,
esthetics, and function can be compromised [3]. ETW has a high prevalence worldwide [4]
and it affects approximately 46% of teenagers [5] and 80% of adults [6] in the United
States, as reported by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Despite these alarming numbers, speciﬁc diagnostic rules and evidence-based management
guidelines are yet to be established. Currently, clinical assessment and monitoring of ETW
are performed by visual examination using subjective indices [7]. This traditional approach
limits the detection of ETW lesions to mostly advanced stages, wherein considerable
destruction of the tooth has already occurred, resulting in pain and irreversible changes
in dental form, function, and esthetics. In these circumstances, the required restorative
treatments are complex and costly [8]. There is a clear need for objective methods to
detect, diagnose, and monitor ETW early, allowing the implementation of personalized
and evidence-based management plans focused speciﬁcally on preventive measures.
This exploratory analysis involved subjects previously diagnosed with hyposalivation.
Saliva plays a crucial role in the development of ETW, and the lack thereof puts patients
at higher risk for ETW development or progression [9,10]. Our ﬁrst hypothesis in this
investigation was that ETW lesions could be detected and differentiated by using scale-
sensitive, tridimensional dental surface texture analysis of point clouds generated by
white-light scanning confocal proﬁlometry (WSCP). Some integrated metrics of dental
microwear analysis have proven to be useful for similar dental applications, including
surface fractal complexity (or change in apparent roughness with the scale of observation)
and anisotropy (or directionality of the wear pattern) [11]. Our previous in vitro and in situ
data have shown the ability of these outcomes to identify and differentiate between the
main dental wear mechanisms of ETW lesions with a good degree of certainty [12,13]. Our
second hypothesis was that cross-polarization optical coherence tomography (CP-OCT)
could provide objective clinical measures of ETW progression, based on the longitudinal
monitoring of dental enamel thickness. CP-OCT allows for safe, non-destructive, and
repetitive measurements of enamel thickness [14]. It also allows for the study of the tissues’
polarization properties and provides higher-resolution images and better visualization of
the enamel structure and dentin–enamel junction [15,16]. Our previous in vitro and in situ
studies have demonstrated its potential as a clinical tool to monitor ETW [17,18].
This exploratory study aimed to compare the objective outcomes of enamel surface
texture using WSCP and enamel thickness with CP-OCT to a standard subjective visual
assessment (Basic Erosive Wear Evaluation—BEWE) and explore their potential to be
used clinically for the detection and monitoring of naturally developed ETW lesions in a
high-risk population.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design
This study consisted of a single-site longitudinal observational clinical study, con-
ducted at the Oral Health Research Institute of the Indiana University School of Dentistry
(IUSD). Twenty-nine subjects previously diagnosed with dry mouth at The Center for Oral
Diagnosis and Treatment, IUSD, or any other IUSD clinic, and three control (no dry mouth)
subjects were enrolled to participate in the study. The study was carried out for about
20 months employing a ‘rolling’ subject recruitment that lasted for six months. Each
recruited subject was then assessed periodically up to 12 months after their baseline visit.
A trained and calibrated examiner performed the clinical assessment using the BEWE
index to classify the surfaces of all incisors, canines, premolars, and ﬁrst molars according
to the degree of severity of the ETW lesion (score 0: no erosion; 1: loss of enamel surface
texture; 2: enamel loss of <50% of surface area; 3: enamel loss of >50%) and a self-completed
questionnaire (diet and behavioral habits) was used to identify related risk factors. Subjects
at high risk for ETW development were selected for the study based on these criteria.
Diagnostics 2023, 13, 2568
3 of 12
Further evaluation of the subjects’ teeth by trained examiners was performed using the test
objective outcomes of surface texture and enamel thickness. Outcomes were assessed at
baseline and after 3 (M3), 6 (M6), 9 (M9), and 12 (M12) months.
2.2. Study Participants
The clinical study protocol followed the Declaration of Helsinki and was reviewed and
approved by the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Institutional Review
Board (protocol no. 1910664803). Subject recruitment and screening occurred between July
2020 and February 2021. Potential subjects previously diagnosed with dry mouth at The
Center for Oral Diagnosis and Treatment (CODT, IUSD) were invited to participate in the
study. The control subjects (no diagnosis of hyposalivation) were recruited from the IUSD
dental clinics. These subjects were prescreened to meet age and health requirements using
an IRB-approved phone script.
Prior to screening, subjects were asked to sign a written informed consent form. To
be included in the study, subjects had to be 18–85 years old and generally healthy; have a
minimum of eight BEWE-scorable teeth with at least one ETW lesion (BEWE ≥ 1), except for
control subjects; have indicated dietary acid exposure in the questionnaire; and have been
previously diagnosed with dry mouth, except for controls. Control subjects needed to have
a normal salivary ﬂow rate of ≥0.8 mL/min stimulated and ≥0.2 mL/min unstimulated
saliva and teeth without clinical signs of advanced ETW. Subjects were excluded if they
were visually assessed by the study dentist to clinically have any untreated cavitated caries
lesions or moderate to severe periodontal disease. Subjects who presented with caries
lesions at screening were only allowed to continue in the study if they had their caries
lesions appropriately treated before the baseline visit.
The sample size calculation indicated the need to recruit 60 subjects with a higher risk
for ETW (dry mouth) and 8 controls (normal salivary ﬂow). We assumed 8 teeth per subject,
with baseline BEWE scores in high-risk subjects as follows: 10% of teeth with BEWE 3,
20% with BEWE 2, 30% with BEWE 1, and 50% with BEWE 0. The 95% lower conﬁdence
bound (LCB) for overall model accuracy to classify teeth by baseline BEWE score extends
3% from the estimated accuracy; within each BEWE score, the LCB extends up to 10%. The
expectation was that at least 10% of teeth would show ETW progression, so the LCB for
accuracy of the model predicting ETW progression extends up to 10% from the estimated
accuracy.
2.3. Clinical Study Procedures
Study completion entailed subject participation during each of the six study visits:
screening, baseline, M3, M6, M9, and M12. Study participants were asked for informed
consent and their medical history as well as the completion of a self-administered diet
and behavioral questionnaire. Oral soft and hard tissue examinations were conducted
and clinical assessment using the BEWE index was performed by a trained/calibrated
examiner to determine which subjects qualiﬁed for the study. Qualiﬁed subjects had
alginate impressions (Jeltrate Plus, Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE, USA) taken for both
dental arches that were used for the fabrication of CP-OCT tray guides (described below)
and modiﬁed custom trays. Unstimulated and stimulated saliva ﬂow rates were measured
during the initial visit for the control group subjects. Qualiﬁed subjects returned after
1 week (±5 days) for the continuation of the baseline assessments. Salivary ﬂow rates were
then determined for the dry-mouth subjects during the subsequent visit after discontinuing
their saliva-stimulating medications 24 h prior. The subjects’ teeth were brushed using a
prepasted toothbrush (ReadyBrush, ReadyBrush, Boca Raton, FL, USA), rinsed, and dried
to remove the bioﬁlm or pellicle. Dental impressions were taken for both dental arches
of all the subjects using polyvinylsiloxane impression material (President Jet Regular and
Light Body, Coltene/Whaledent AG, Altstätten, Switzerland) for enamel surface texture
analysis. Three-dimensional CP-OCT images were then taken from the window of the
CP-OCT imaging tray guide for the measurements. Each of the assessment methods for
Diagnostics 2023, 13, 2568
4 of 12
ETW (BEWE, diet and behavioral questionnaire, CP-OCT enamel thickness, and surface
texture) was conducted during the succeeding visits at M3, M6, M9, and M12.
2.4. BEWE Scoring
ETW severity was scored and recorded according to the BEWE index [19]. A previously
trained examiner scored the buccal, occlusal (for posterior teeth), and lingual surfaces of
all incisors, canines, premolars, and ﬁrst molars according to the degree of severity of the
ETW lesion. Scoring was performed at baseline, M3, M6, M9, and M12.
2.5. Surface Texture Analysis
White-light scanning confocal proﬁlometry (Neox, Sensofar LLC, Newington, CT,
USA) was used to analyze the buccal surface of the impressions. The central area of the
middle third (mesiodistally and inciso/occluso-cervically) of the buccal surface was chosen
for analysis. The planimetric work envelope for each tooth sample was 242 × 181 µm2 with
a lateral point spacing of 0.17 µm in both x and y directions, a vertical step of 0.2 µm, and a
published resolution of <2 nm, measured in three locations, as previously reported [12].
Trained and calibrated examiners performed measurements on the central area of the buccal
surfaces of specimens collected at baseline and M12. Point clouds for each surface were
assessed by dental microwear texture analysis. Area-scale fractal complexity (Asfc) [20]
and ISO 25178 standards for texture aspect ratio (Str) and arithmetical mean height (Sa)
were calculated to characterize scale-sensitive complexity, anisotropy, and roughness of
each surface, respectively. Analyses were conducted using MountainsMap 8 (Digital Surf,
Besançon, France). These variables have been shown to consistently reveal aspects of the
surface texture of value for distinguishing dental wear types [12,21,22].
2.6. Enamel Thickness Analysis
CP-OCT imaging tray guides (Figure 1a) were custom-made to ﬁt the subjects’ maxil-
lary and mandibular dental arches using soft ethylene vinyl acetate sheets (125 mm round,
1 mm thick, Keystone Industries, Gibbstown, NJ, USA). The sheets were vacuum-formed to
the casts of each dental arch using a pressure molding machine (Biostar® SCHEU-DENTAL
GmbH, Iserlohn, Germany) and trimmed to extend half a tooth away from the most poste-
rior tooth included in the study and about 2 mm away from the gingival margin to maintain
good adaptation. Round window holes 2 mm in diameter were created on the middle
third (mesiodistally and inciso/occluso-cervically) of the buccal surfaces. A thin layer of
red nail varnish was applied onto the walls of the CP-OCT tray guide windows for easier
localization while positioned in the subject’s oral cavity. The same CP-OCT imaging tray
guides with round windows were used for each subject over the different study visits
(while observing infection control measures) to facilitate CP-OCT probe repositioning and
imaging of the same area on the buccal surfaces of the tooth over time to be used for
longitudinal enamel thickness analysis.
Three-dimensional enamel scans were acquired using a portable dental CP-OCT
system with a handheld probe (Santec Inner Vision IVS-300-S-L-C; Santec Corp, Ko-
maki, Japan). The device used a swept source laser light with a center wavelength of
1310 ± 30 nm and a high scan rate of 30 kHz with a maximum lateral probe scanning
area of 5 × 5 mm and a working distance of 1 mm. Axial imaging in the air was >5.6 mm
with a 3 mm depth of focus while axial and lateral resolutions in the air were ≤12 µm and
30 µm, respectively.
Before scanning, the buccal surfaces of the maxillary teeth were gently air-dried for
~10 s and isolated using cotton rolls as needed. The CP-OCT imaging tray guide was then
ﬁtted on top of the teeth and 3D CP-OCT scanning was carried out. During scanning, the
probe was held horizontally perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth being scanned
and positioned directly on top of the CP-OCT tray guide with the borders of the CP-OCT
tray guide window contained within the scanning area. Three-dimensional tomograms
were obtained from the buccal surfaces of each of the included maxillary teeth using a
Diagnostics 2023, 13, 2568
5 of 12
dedicated imaging and analysis software (Inner Vision IVS-300 ver5.3.2, Santec Corp.,
Komaki, Japan) where the refractive index was set at 1.6 for enamel. Once the maxillary
arch was scanned, the maxillary CP-OCT imaging tray guide was removed, and the same
methods were applied to the mandibular arch. Central B-scans (2D images) in the Y-
direction were then selected from each 3D scan and saved for enamel thickness analyses.
Enamel thickness measurements (from DEJ to the surface of the specimen) on the 2D images
were performed using Santec Inner Vision IVS-300 software (Santec Corp., Komaki, Japan).
The measurement position was identiﬁed at the center of the enamel width at the base of
the CP-OCT tray guide window with the aid of a screen ruler (A Ruler for Windows v3.3,
https://www.arulerforwindows.com accessed on 8 July 2022). The distance (mm) between
the depths of the highest light intensity peaks at the enamel surface and DEJ areas was then
calculated from the A-scan. CP-OCT scanning and enamel thickness measurements were
performed at baseline, M3, M6, M9, and M12. A representative B-scan of a maxillary molar
is shown in Figure 1c.

2.7. Statistical Analyses
Data collected at baseline and M12 for all parameters were used for the analyses. Data
for M3, M6, and M9 were excluded as surface texture parameters of Asfc (complexity), Str
(anisotropy), and Sa (roughness) could not be obtained.
Spearman correlation coefﬁcients were used to evaluate the associations among mea-
surements. Using the longitudinal follow-up assessments, linear mixed-effects models
evaluated changes in surface texture and enamel thickness (monitor ETW). These models
Diagnostics 2023, 13, 2568
6 of 12
included random effects to correlate data within a tooth over time, as well as allow different
variances at each time point and correlate multiple teeth within a subject. Teeth with
changes in BEWE scores were compared to those without such changes during follow-up
for differences in changes in surface texture and enamel thickness parameters using linear
mixed-effects models. A two-sided 5% signiﬁcance level was used for all tests.
3. Results
Twenty-nine subjects with a history of diagnosed hyposalivation and three control
subjects were enrolled in the study. One dry-mouth subject dropped out after the baseline
visit. A maximum number of 597 teeth that were scoreable for BEWE on any of the surfaces
at baseline were included. Among them, 584 teeth were used for surface texture analyses of
their buccal surfaces, and 531 teeth were included for the enamel thickness measurements
with CP-OCT. Teeth that were malposed or posteriorly located with the buccal mucosa not
allowing proper CP-OCT probe positioning were excluded. Out of the 29 subjects who had
a history of hyposalivation, 9 and 18 had normal unstimulated and stimulated saliva ﬂow
rates, respectively.
BEWE scores of the different surfaces (BEWEBuccal, BEWEOcclusal, BEWELingual) at
baseline and M12 of dry-mouth subjects are shown in Table 1. BEWE for all surfaces was
greater at M12 compared to baseline (p < 0.001). For the same longitudinal comparison,
enamel thickness decreased, Asfc showed no change, and Sa and Str parameters increased.
Results for the different parameters for control subjects are shown in Table S1. Statistical
analyses within the control group, as well as the comparison of the control and dry-mouth
subjects, were not performed due to the small number of control subjects recruited.

The direct comparison between tested parameters (Table 2) revealed that BEWEOcclusal
correlated poorly with enamel thickness as measured on the buccal surface of posterior teeth.
BEWEBuccal, on the other hand, did not correlate with enamel thickness measurements.
BEWEBuccal and BEWELingual correlated moderately, while BEWEBuccal correlated strongly
with the BEWEMax. Comparisons of the longitudinal changes indicated that ∆Asfc and
∆Str correlated moderately, while ∆Asfc and ∆Sa, as well as ∆Sa and ∆Str, exhibited weak
correlation (Table 3). Both ∆BEWEBuccal and ∆BEWELingual correlated moderately with
∆BEWEMax. A similar correlation was observed between ∆BEWEOcclusal (posterior teeth)
and ∆BEWEMax. Only data at baseline and M12 were compared and analyzed.
Additional analyses comparing teeth with and without ETW progression—based on
BEWE examination—revealed no signiﬁcant differences in ∆Asfc and ∆enamel thickness
over time. However, teeth with ETW progression (BEWE increase) showed greater changes
in ∆Sa and ∆Str over time compared to teeth without ETW progression (Table 4).

4. Discussion
Our previous in vitro [12,18] and in situ studies [13,17] have demonstrated the poten-
tial of enamel thickness (by CP-OCT) and the dental microwear texture parameters Asfc,
Str, and Sa (by WSCP) to detect and monitor ETW lesion progression over time. However,
in vitro and in situ studies are limited as they do not fully replicate clinical conditions.
In the present exploratory clinical study, these objective outcomes were compared to the
BEWE index, a subjective but widely used clinical index for ETW. The study population
consisted of patients previously diagnosed with hyposalivation, as they were considered at
higher risk for ETW, and their clinical ﬁndings were to be compared to those of subjects
who were never diagnosed nor had symptoms of hyposalivation (control). Unfortunately,
our planned recruitment and part of the laboratory analyses (dental microwear) were
negatively impacted by the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Even after
extending the recruitment phase from 3 to 6 months, it was not feasible to meet our total
target subject numbers (n = 68). A decision was made to stop enrollment, considering that
we had reached the number of teeth needed, as determined by our a priori sample size
calculation (n = 544). This was possible as we had initially set the minimum number of
scoreable teeth per subject at eight, but most subjects had a signiﬁcantly higher number of
teeth that were scoreable with BEWE. However, it is important to note that the lower num-
ber of enrolled subjects may have limited the individual subject variation representation in
our data. Nevertheless, the varied nature of ETW per tooth surface within the same subject
supported the shift to using the total number of teeth instead of the number of subjects as
the basis for the sample size. In addition to the aforementioned limitation brought about by
the smaller number of subjects, the initially planned comparison between hyposalivation
and control participants (at n = 3), wherein ETW progression was less expected, was no
longer applicable and is thus a limitation of this study. Tooth-based comparisons between
teeth with and without ETW progression within the hyposalivation group were performed
instead to see the trends and associations among the different ETW parameters (Table 4).
In the current study, all surfaces of each tooth included were scored for BEWE, and
the BEWEBuccal scores were compared to those of the other parameters. Progression of
ETW over time was observed in the hyposalivation population, as shown by the signiﬁcant
increase in BEWE scores from baseline to M12 for all surfaces (p < 0.001). Nonetheless, the
mean increase in the BEWE score was less than 1 and smaller than what we anticipated for
high-risk subjects. In hindsight, a longer study duration could have been advantageous to
better discern between subjects at high and low risk for ETW. Although recruited subjects
had been previously diagnosed with hyposalivation, and were therefore at higher risk for
ETW [9,10], 9 showed normal unstimulated salivary ﬂow, while 18 out of the 29 subjects
had normal stimulated ﬂow rates during testing, despite temporarily discontinuing their
saliva-stimulating medications at least 24 h prior to the measurements. This might indicate
that for these subjects, dry mouth may not have been a major risk factor for ETW. Further

differentiation of the subjects based on their salivary ﬂow rates was not performed since
the related inclusion criterion was only a history of hyposalivation. Moreover, salivary ﬂow
rates could have varied during the length of the study due to the adoption of individual
measures to control the clinical symptoms or changes in the severity of the condition [23].
Future studies ensuring a larger number of subjects and periodical measurement of actual
salivary ﬂow rates may provide better insights into the differences in effects of an earlier
hyposalivation diagnosis and speciﬁc salivary ﬂow rates on ETW progression. In terms
of surface comparison, change in BEWE was greater for the occlusal and lingual surfaces
than for the buccal surface, which means that ETW progression was more evident on
both occlusal and lingual surfaces than the buccal. However, BEWE on all three surfaces
correlated moderately with BEWEMax (Table 2). This supports the use of buccal surfaces
for comparison with the other test parameters in this study.
The presence of ETW progression was also supported by the decrease in enamel
thickness from baseline to M12 as measured by CP-OCT. This corroborates CP-OCT’s
potential to monitor changes in enamel thickness both in vitro and in situ within the same
tooth over time [17,18]. These prior studies [17,18] were carried out in ideal conditions,
with enamel specimens of standardized dimensions and ﬂat enamel surfaces allowing
proper working distance and probe angulation during imaging. Despite the encouraging
results observed in the current study, there were many challenges. Our measurements were
limited to the buccal surfaces only as the wide and ﬂat probe head conﬁguration made
the access of lingual surfaces challenging. Also, clinical CP-OCT imaging was limited by
different surrounding anatomical structures, such as the oral soft tissues. As mentioned
earlier, teeth that are malposed or with oral soft tissues precluding proper CP-OCT probe
positioning were excluded, resulting in relatively fewer teeth examined for the enamel
thickness parameter in the study. The natural curvature of teeth as well as the involvement
of the whole tooth contributed to greater difﬁculty in probe positioning. Hence, the use
of a CP-OCT tray guide with pre-established windows was essential in ensuring more
accurate repositioning and imaging of the same area of each tooth during every visit. The
scanning window of the CP-OCT probe was held as close as possible and parallel to the
buccal surface of the CP-OCT tray guide during scanning. Nevertheless, it was inevitable to
have some degree of variation during imaging. In such cases, there were slight differences
in the angulation of the surface being scanned. This also could have had an effect on the
variability and the ease of obtaining enamel thickness measurements at the center of the
enamel width captured within the CP-OCT tray window from the enamel surface to the
DEJ. For teeth in which some angulation variation was unavoidable, particularly in the
molars and malposed teeth, uneven light attenuation was more evident with the unequal
working distance from the enamel surface. A greater distance meant higher attenuation
and a lower contrast of enamel from the underlying structures, which made the analysis of
the central B-scans more difﬁcult. Considering these limitations, it would be desirable if
OCT systems for clinical use were further developed with a better probe head conﬁguration
and better light intensity to offset the attenuation effect with greater distances. Despite the
imaging limitations, a 29 ± 72 µm mean change in enamel thickness, which was relatively
small but signiﬁcant, was detected over time, conﬁrming the suitability of using CP-OCT to
monitor ETW longitudinally. The detection of only a minimal change in enamel thickness
was consistent with the relatively small change in BEWE scores.
Both BEWE and enamel thickness changed signiﬁcantly over time, suggesting that
both parameters could independently detect the clinical progression of ETW. However, in
terms of correlation, neither enamel thickness nor change in enamel thickness correlated
with BEWE or with a change in BEWE scores. There were also no signiﬁcant differences
in the changes in enamel thickness when comparing teeth that showed and did not show
changes in BEWE (Table 4). This might be because a much larger area of the tooth was
considered for the BEWE scoring while CP-OCT measured only a comparatively smaller
area for enamel thickness measurements. Furthermore, the two parameters measured two
different aspects of ETW severity on the enamel. BEWE scoring is performed depending
Diagnostics 2023, 13, 2568

on the surface area involved, whereas enamel thickness measurements reﬂect surface loss
as a function of depth into the enamel relative to the original surface. These results sug-
gest that it would be beneﬁcial to assess ETW severity not just with BEWE but also with
the enamel thickness assessment. Future studies should focus on which of the two mea-
sures of ETW severity correlates better with the onset of clinical symptoms resulting from
ETW progression.
Among the 3D surface texture outcomes, only Sa (roughness) signiﬁcantly correlated
with BEWEBuccal both at baseline and at M12 (Table 2). BEWEBuccal scores were lower at
baseline than at M12 (Table 1), which means ETW was less severe at baseline than the
latter. Enamel surface roughness (Sa) was also lower at baseline compared to M12 (Table 1),
corroborating the results of a previous in situ study that found higher surface roughness
in more severe ETW lesions [13]. Several limitations of this exploratory clinical study,
however, precluded further differentiation of the degree of surface roughness according to
BEWE scores. This could be a focus of future investigations to see if certain thresholds for
Sa values could correspond with ETW severity according to BEWE. Both dental microwear
texture parameters Sa and Str (anisotropy) increased over time from baseline to M12. The
increase in roughness was consistent with the previous study [13], while the Str trend was
different as it did not previously change signiﬁcantly. Asfc did not show any signiﬁcant
change in this study, contrary to our previous in situ study [13], where it signiﬁcantly
increased in the severe ETW group. ∆Asfc, ∆Sa, and ∆Str all had a statistically signiﬁcant
but weak correlation with ∆BEWEBuccal (Table 3), while none of the changes in all three
surface texture parameters correlated with the change in enamel thickness. Teeth with an
increase in BEWE had signiﬁcantly greater ∆Sa and ∆Str than teeth that did not show BEWE
progression. This was expected as both BEWE and surface texture parameters measure
changes on the enamel surface, in contrast to enamel thickness measurements, which
relate more to cumulative surface loss. Of the three microwear texture parameters, only
roughness (Sa) consistently increased with ETW progression over time in the current and
previous in situ study [13]. These results might support the use of the surface roughness (Sa)
parameter as another objective measure of ETW progression. Surface texture assessment
was originally planned to be conducted at baseline, M3, M6, M9, and M12. However, due
to the limitations mentioned earlier, the baseline and M12 measurements were prioritized,
with the intermediate time points dropped from this study.
5. Conclusions
Despite the several limitations of this exploratory study to objectively diagnose and
monitor ETW clinically, the potential of surface roughness (Sa) as an objective outcome
measure to identify ETW lesion severity and progression, comparable with the BEWE
index, was conﬁrmed. Moreover, longitudinal monitoring of enamel thickness using
CP-OCT may be clinically relevant in addition to ETW severity determination by BEWE
and or dental microwear parameters, accepting both tested hypotheses. Future studies
resulting in a greater degree of ETW natural progression would be beneﬁcial to further
conﬁrm our ﬁndings that surface roughness and enamel thickness are potentially suitable
and appropriate objective measures for the clinical assessment and monitoring of erosive
tooth wear.
