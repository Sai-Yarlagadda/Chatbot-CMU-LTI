Abstract 
Background Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a common pathogen that often causes diarrhea in piglets. Since bacteria are 
becoming more and more resistant to antibiotics, phages have become a promising alternative therapy. However, 
the therapy of oral phage often fails to achieve the desired effect. A novel phage named A221 was isolated by using E. 
coli GXXW-1103 as host strain, characterized by electron microscopy, genomic sequencing and analyzed by measur-
ing lysis ability in vitro.
Results Phage A221 was identified as a member of Ackermannviridae, Aglimvirinae, Agtrevirus with 153297 bp 
genome and effectively inhibited bacterial growth in vitro for 16 h. This study was conducted to evaluate the thera-
peutic effect of oral microencapsulated phage A221 on E. coli GXXW-1103 infections in weaned piglets. The protec-
tive effect of phage was evaluated by body weight analysis, bacterial load and histopathological changes. The results 
showed that with the treatment of phage A221, the body weight of piglets increased, the percentage of Enterobacte-
riaceae in duodenum decreased to 0.64%, the lesions in cecum and duodenum were alleviated, and the bacterial load 
in the jejunal lymph nodes, cecum and spleen were also significantly different with infected group (P < 0.001).
Conclusions The results showed that phage A221 significantly increased the daily weight gain of piglets, reduced 
the bacterial load of tissues and the intestinal lesions, achieved the same therapeutic effect as antibiotic Florfenicol. 
Taken together, oral microencapsulated phage A221 has a good therapeutic effect on bacterial diarrhea of weaned 
piglets, which provides guidance for the clinical application of phage therapy in the future.

Background
E. coli is the most prevalent Gram-negative bacterial 
pathogen, according to studies, it can cause a wide 
range of clinical illnesses [1]. It is one of the most 
important causes of post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in 
piglets. Diarrheagenic strains of E. coli can be divided 
into at least six different categories with correspond-
ing distinct pathogenic mechanisms [2]. The entero-
toxigenic E. coli with F4 and F18 are the two main 
pathogens associated with PWD in piglets [3]. Anti-
biotics are the primary antibacterial agents because of

their broad spectrum and high efficiency. However, an 
increasing number of antibiotic resistance genes has 
been identified in E. coli isolates during the last dec-
ades [4]. In recent years, antibiotic abuse had caused 
health emergency situations and had a huge socioeco-
nomic impact [5]. In addition, the use of broad-spec-
trum antibiotics may cause dysregulation of the gut 
microbiota, which in turn increases the risk of other 
bacterial infections [6]. Against the background of this 
era, phage therapy is being investigated as an alterna-
tive therapeutic method for bacterial infections which 
are multidrug resistance [7].
Phages are the viruses which can infect and replicate 
within bacteria, and they could be found anywhere, 
including the water, soil, and air [8]. Garcia, P et  al. 
showed that widely distributed phages can serve as 
effective biocontrol agents for controlling foodborne 
pathogens [9]. In fact, there have been multiple studies 
demonstrating that phages can be used in live animals. 
El-Gohary, F.A et  al. concluded that augmentation of 
the environment with phage is an effective method 
to prevent colibacillosis in broiler chickens by moni-
toring the body weight and mortality of broilers [10]. 
In a study conducted in 2019, Richards et  al. used a 
phage cocktail containing two virulent Campylobac-
ter phages (CP20 and CP30) to treat broiler chick-
ens colonized with C. jejuni HPC5. They found that 
phages could effectively reduce Campylobacter counts 
in cecum contents without affecting the microbiota 
structure [11].
The applied dose and preparation that can enable 
phage to obtain effective antibacterial effect have pre-
viously been explored. In a study by Rozema et  al., 
four rectal doses of phage were shown to be less effec-
tive against E. coli O157:H7 than oral administration 
[12]. However, the main problem with oral applica-
tion of phage is the acidity and proteolytic activity 
in the stomach [13]. In this experiment, we used the 
sodium alginate to microencapsulated phage A221. 
Microencapsulation provides a new route for the oral 
utilization of phage, which can protect them from 
the gastric environment of the stomach. This helps to 
ensure that high concentrations of phages reach the 
actual sites of infection when administered orally [14], 
greatly improving the availability of phages in clinical 
medicine.
In this study, we isolated and characterized a phage 
named A221, microencapsulated it with sodium algi-
nate, and used it for the oral treatment of piglets. This 
study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of oral 
microencapsulated phage on weaned piglets which was 
infected with E. coli, and provide help for the future 
clinical application of phage.
Results
Isolation and biological characteristics analysis of phage 
A221
Phage A221 was isolated from pig farm sewage by using 
E. coli GXXW-1103 as host strain. The morphology of 
phage A221 on double-layer agar plates was presented 
clear, small plaques in size of 0.2 –0.5  mm in diame-
ter (Fig. 1A). The TEM image showed that phage A221 
had a capsid diameter of 90 ± 2 nm and a tail length of 
103 ± 2 nm (Fig. 1B).
Phage A221 exhibited stable activity between pH 
5.0–9.0 and was inactivated when acid or base levels 
continued to rise (Fig.  1C). According to the one-step 
growth curve, the incubation period and burst period of 
phage A221 was about 10 min and 30 min, respectively 
(Fig. 1D). The burst size of phage A221 was determined 
to be 100 ± 2 plaque-forming units (PFU)/cell.
To evaluate the lysis efficacy of phage A221 in  vitro, 
the growth curve of the host strain E. coli GXXW-1103 
was determined in MH broth. The OD450nm of E. coli 
GXXW-1103 with 1000 MOI phage was maintained 
below 0.4 during 0 h to 13 h, while the  OD450nm of bacte-
ria without phage continuously increased from 0.4 to 1.6. 
The result indicated that phage A221 had sufficient lysis 
efficacy in vitro (Fig. 1E).
We determined the host spectrum of phage A221 by 
using twenty bacterial strains, including fourteen Escher-
ichia coli strains and six Salmonella strains. As shown in 
Table  1, phage A221 has infectivity on E. coli GXXW-
1103, FJEC19-2 and SCEC-28. The results showed that 
phage A221 was a virulent phage with lysis ability against 
E. coli strains, and the host spectrum was not extensive.
Genome analysis of phage A221
The 
length 
of 
the 
whole 
genome 
of 
phage 
A221(ON862890.1) is 153,297 bp, with a GC content of 
49.11%. In the A221 genome, 192 open reading frames 
(ORFs) were predicted (Fig. 2). No antibiotic resistance 
and virulence genes were detected in the whole genome 
of phage A221.
DNA polymerase protein sequences were used in 
a phylogenetic analysis, which revealed that phage 
A221 belonged to the same branch with Salmo-
nella phage SKML-39 (JX181829.1), Gp43 Shigella 
phage phiSboM-AG3 (FJ373894.1), Salmonella phage 
P46FS4 (MT078988.1) and Enterobacter virus phiEM4 
(LC373201.1) (Fig. 3). Our data showed that these phages 
belonged to a same clade and the phage A221 might be a 
member of that family Ackermannviridae, Aglimvirinae, 
Agtrevirus.
For further similarity analysis, phage A221 was com-
pared whole-genome with Escherichia phage vB_EcoM-
ZQ1 (MW650886.1), Salmonella phage P46FS4 (NC:

049509.1) and Shigella phage phiSboM-AG3 (NC: 
013693.1). The results showed that the four phages had 
high similarity in different modules (Fig. 4).
Effect of microencapsulation on phage concentration
The effects of the microencapsulation methods on phage 
viability were tested. Nontreated (naked) phage produced 
titers averaging 1.76 ×  109 PFU/ml. After dissolved in 
MBS for 5 min, the titre of the released phages reached 
1.39 ×  109 PFU/ml, representing a release rate of 78.98%.
Oral administration of microencapsulated phage A221 
reduced E. coli infection in weaned piglets
(i) Body weight and average daily weight gain
The body weight of weaned piglets was measured to 
observe the therapeutic effect of phage A221 on piglets. 
The results showed that piglets in the infected group con-
tinued to lose body weight (from 5.6  kg to 4.5  kg) and 
all piglets died within 9 days, while the body weight of 
piglets in the A221 group, the FFC group and the non-
infected group increased in 13 days, from 5.5 kg to 7.6 kg, 
5.6 kg to 7.8 kg and 5.7 kg to 8.4 kg, respectively (Fig. 5A). 
For  further  evaluating  the growth performance of pig-
lets, we recorded the average daily weight gain of piglets 
in each group. The average daily gain of piglets in the 
A221 group was 0.160 kg, which was significantly higher 
(P < 0.001) than that in the infected group (-0.05 kg), no 
significant difference (P > 0.05) compared with FFC group 
(0.168  kg) and Non-infected group (0.2  kg) (Fig.  5B). 
These data indicated that oral treatment with microen-
capsulated phage A221 alleviated the effects of diarrhea 
caused by E. coli GXXW-1103 and restored weight gain 
in piglets.
 (ii) Bacterial loads of tissues and relative abundance of 
microbiota
The bacterial load in diseased animal tissues is crucial 
for studying the disease development, so we measured 
the bacterial load of some tissues of piglets in different 
groups. The results showed that under the treatment of 
oral microencapsulated phage A221, the bacterial load 
in jejunal lymph nodes (Fig.  6A), cecum (Fig.  6B) and 
spleen decreased (Fig. 6C) significantly (P < 0.001) com-
pared with the infected group, and there was no obvi-
ous difference (P > 0.05) compared with the FFC group. 
Compared with the non-infected group, the bacterial 
loads in the cecum (Fig. 6B) and spleen (Fig. 6C) of the 
A221 group were not significantly different from the 
negative group (P > 0.05), except for the jejunal lymph 
nodes (P < 0.01). Similarly, the proportion of Enterobacte-
riaceae in the intestinal flora of the group A221 was sig-
nificantly lower (P < 0.001) than that of the infected group 
(Fig. 6D). Furthermore, by comparing the proportions of 
other bacteria in the duodenum, we found that the pro-
portion of two beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillusaceae

and Oscillospiraceae) in the A221 group was signifi-
cantly higher (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001) than their propor-
tions in the infected group (Fig.  6E, F). These results 
showed, under the treatment of phage A221, the relative 
abundance of beneficial bacteria in the intestinal flora of 
piglets was not significantly affected and the number of 
pathogenic bacteria was significantly reduced.
 (iii) Histopathological changes
Pathological sections of the cecum and duodenum 
were observed to assess the health of the piglets in each 
group. In the non-infected group, there were no intestinal 
lesions observed (Figs. 7A, E, I, M and Fig. 8A, E, I, M). 
In the infected group, caecal lymph nodes were enlarged, 
intestinal glands were denatured, and only vacuoles were 
left (Fig. 7B, F, J, N); the intestinal villi of the duodenum 
were atrophic and degraded, with unclear tissue struc-
ture and a lot of bleeding spots in the basal layer (Fig. 8B, 
F, J, N). In both treatment groups (A221 group and FFC

and received saline treatment (B + F + J + N), and non-infected piglets received only saline treatment (A + E + L + M). The histopathological changes 
of piglets on the phage A221 treatment (C + G + K + O) and the FFC treatment (D + H + L + P). Scale bar 150 μm in A-D, I-L and Scale bar 75 μm

group), intestinal lesions were significantly improved: the 
size of the lymph nodes in the caecum was similar to the 
size of the cecum lymph nodes in the non-infected group, 
the intestinal glands had no obvious lesions (Fig. 7C, D, 
G, H, K, L, O, P); the intestinal villi of duodenum were 
intact, with clear tissue structure and a few bleedings 
points (Fig. 8C, D, G, H, K, L, O, P). These results indicate 
that oral administration of the microencapsulated phage 
A221, like oral administration of antibiotic FFC, can 
reduce the microscopic intestinal lesions in piglets with 
E. coli GXXW-1103.
Discussion
Weaning factors may affect the immune functions [15] 
and the intestinal microflora [16] of the piglets negatively. 
Although the background of post-weaning diarrhea 
(PWD) should be considered multifactorial, it is often 
associated with E. coli. PWD caused by E. coli is a signifi-
cant cause of economic losses in the pig industry, primar-
ily due to increased mortality and decreased productivity 
[17]. Piglets with diarrhea often have poor appetite, so 
when fed antibiotics with mixed feed, the dose of anti-
biotic will be increased to avoid insufficient dose. This

and received saline treatment (B + F + J + N), and non-infected piglets received only saline treatment (A + E + I + M). The histopathological changes 
of piglets on the phage A221 treatment (C + G + K + O) and the FFC treatment (D + H + L + P)

measure has the potential to lead to the abuse of antibi-
otics and increase bacterial resistance. Unlike antibiotics, 
small doses of phages can exert curative effects, because 
it can use host bacteria to replicate themselves in the ani-
mal body.
The evolution of bacterial resistance to phages is also 
under constant investigation. Bull et al. [18] found that 
phage inhibited bacterial growth in liquid medium for 
2-16  h, but the bacterial content slowly increased after 
too long because some bacteria would develop phage 
resistance. The study by Lourenço, Marta, et  al. [19] 
research showed that the heterogeneous biogeography 
of microbes contributes to the long-term coexistence 
of phages with phage-susceptible bacteria. Neverthe-
less, there are still more studies that can demonstrate the 
effectiveness of phage therapy.
In this study, the pathogenic bacteria E. coli GXXW-
1103 which carried Colistin F18 and Enterotoxin Stb, 
was isolated from the feces of weaned piglets with severe 
diarrhea in a pig farm. Colistin F18 adsorbs on the sur-
face of small intestinal epithelial cells, settles, multiplies 
and then produces enterotoxin, which stimulates the 
small intestinal epithelial cells to produce a large amount 
of fluid into the intestinal lumen, causing diarrhea in pig-
lets. Enterotoxin Stb binds to the corresponding recep-
tor, synthesizes cAMP, activates G-regulatory proteins, 
leads to calcium inward flow, and protein kinase C is acti-
vated. Phosphorylated ground protein kinase C causes 
chloride ions and water to enter the intestinal lumen, 
leading to diarrhea. The phage A221 was isolated from 
sewage by using E. coli GXXW-1103 as host bacteria. 
Although the phage A221 cannot lyse many bacteria, it 
is the only phage isolated in our laboratory that can lyse 
E. coli GXXW-1103 currently. And it does not carry any 
virulence factor and has sufficient antimicrobial action 
in vitro.
We tried to treat diarrhea in weaned piglets by using 
oral phage. However, gastric acid, digestive enzymes, and 
bile salts (BSs) are highly susceptible to destroying phage, 
thereby depriving them of their antibacterial activity 
[20]. The biological characteristics of phage A221 also 
confirmed its rapid inactivation under gastric acid con-
ditions, so we used micro—capsulate technology with 
sodium alginate. Microencapsulation technology is a 
new technology that has developed and matured showing 
wide application potential. Extending the storage time 
of active substances and improving their stability can be 
achieved by using microencapsulation technology [21]. 
Sodium alginate was normal material used by microen-
capsulation with the properties of processible, biocom-
patible, biodegradable and nontoxic for body. Ma et  al. 
[22] investigated in  vitro the effect of simulated gastric 
fluid, bile and intestinal fluid of free phages and phages 
encapsulated with chitosan-alginate-CaCl2 system, and 
showed that the encapsulation technique allows most of 
the phages to remain biologically active in the simulated 
intestinal environment. Colom et al. [23] compared the 
retention in the chicken caecum in vivo of orally admin-
istered sodium alginate/CaCO3-coated phages and free 
phages. The results showed that the retention rates of 
encapsulated phage were higher than those of unencap-
sulated phage after 2 h, 48 h and 72 h, and the differences 
were significant (P < 0.05, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respec-
tively). Both of these studies demonstrated that microen-
capsulation significantly improved the survival rate of the 
phages in the gastrointestinal tract compared with free 
phages. In this experiment, to validate the efficacy of oral 
administration of microencapsulated phage A221, we 
established an oral FFC treatment group as a reference 
for evaluation.
The daily gain can reflect the growth performance of 
piglets. In this study, under the treatment of oral micro-
encapsulated phage A221, the average daily gain of pig-
lets was significantly higher than that of the infected 
group (P < 0.001), and the weight of piglets showed an 
increasing trend. A similar study found that weight gain 
and feed conversion ratios were significantly better in 
the Clostridium perfringens-challenged chickens treated 
with multivalent phage cocktail INT-401 than in the 
Clostridium perfringens-challenged, phage-untreated 
control birds [24]. These results indicated that phage 
could reduce the loss of nutrients caused by pathogenic 
bacteria and restore the absorption and transformation 
of nutrients. At the same time, Wall et  al. showed that 
using the phage cocktail can reduce the concentration of 
Salmonella on cecum (95%; p < 0.05) [25]. In the present 
experiment, our results agree with previous study, phage 
A221 effectively reduced the bacterial load in the jeju-
nal lymph node, cecum and spleen of piglets (P < 0.001), 
reaching the same therapeutic level as antibiotic FFC.
The abundance and diversity of intestinal microbiota 
were closely related to growth performance and post-
weaning diarrhea of piglets [26]. It has been reported 
that antibiotic treatment can shift the population struc-
ture of the microbiota and alter bacterial physiology, such 
as reduction of the amount and diversity of microbes, 
losses in the function of metabolism and the modula-
tion of the immune system [27]. Conversely, phage can 
be used to precisely control harmful bacteria and avoid 
adverse effects like broad-spectrum antibiotic on benefi-
cial bacteria [28]. In this experiment, compared with the 
infected group, phage accurately reduced the number of 
Enterobacteriaceae in duodenum; compared with FFC 
group, the advantages of phage specificity and targeting 
were not well demonstrated. The idea that phages could 
help rebuild a healthier gut microbiome after treating gut

diseases compared to antibiotics needs to be explored 
with more experiments in the future.
The intestinal barrier is the key structure to protect 
against parenteral bacterial infection, an intact intestinal 
barrier is essential in maintaining health [29]. To investi-
gate the pathological changes in the intestines of piglets 
across different groups, cecum and duodenum tissues 
were sliced and Hematoxylin–Eosin (H&E) stained. The 
results showed that E. coli GXXW-1103 caused damage 
to the gut villi and basal layer of cecum and duodenum 
tissues compared with the non-infected group, while the 
A221 group and the FFC groups did not exhibit signifi-
cant intestinal tissue damage. This is similar to a previous 
study in an enteric murine model, which results showed 
that phage cocktail targeting E. coli O157:H7 has com-
parable efficacy compared with Enrofloxacin [30]. Our 
results indicate that oral administration of microencap-
sulated phage A221attenuates the damage to intestinal 
integrity by bacterial.
Conclusion
In summary, oral administration of microencapsulated 
phage A221 was effective in treating diarrhea caused 
by E. coli GXXW-1103 in weaned piglets. In addition, 
this treatment can not only achieve the same efficacy as 
antibiotic FFC, but also effectively avoid affecting other 
microorganisms in the intestinal flora of piglets due to 
its targeting of pathogenic bacteria. Combined with 
the fact that there is no known toxicity, phage therapy 
against E. coli infection in piglets shows great potential. 
In the future, we intend to explore how to make piglets 
ingest phage by drinking water, also, although we did not 
find any harmful effects of phage therapy on the health 
of piglets in this experiment, we will pay more attention 
to characterize any possible immune response of pigs to 
phages in the future research, as has been reported in 
other animals.
Material and methods
Bacteria strains, phage, antibiotics and animal
E. coli GXXW-1103, was used for the challenge experi-
ments. This strain was isolated from diarrhea-piglet 
sources at the farm in Guangxi on 03.11.2020. Take an 
appropriate amount of fresh bacterial solution, extract 
the DNA of GXXW-1103 by using the bacterial DNA 
extraction kit. Referring to the method of Sanches et al. 
[31]. Amplification of 8 virulence factors such as K88, 
K99, Stx1, Stx2, F18, Stb, LT and 987P, primer informa-
tion is given in Table S1. Amplification was performed 
in a 20 μL reaction mixture containing 10 μL of 2 × green 
tap PCR MasterMix, 1 ng of prepared template DNA, 1 
μL of 10 μM/L forward primer, 1 μL of 10 μM/L reverse 
primer and 6 μL of  ddH2O. The amplification program 
was set as follows: pre-denaturation at 94℃ for 2  min; 
denaturation at 94℃ for 1 min, annealing temperature for 
40 s (set the gradient annealing temperature of 50–62), 
extension at 72℃ for 30 s (30 × of the above cycle); final 
extension at 72℃ for 7 min and then stored at 4℃. The 
PCR products were detected by 1.2% agarose gel elec-
trophoresis, the results showed GXXW-1103 carried in 
Colistin F18 and Enterotoxin Stb (Fig. S1). This bacte-
rium was kept at − 80°C in 30% v/v glycerol, and saved in 
clinical veterinary laboratory of Guangxi University.
A phage named A221 was isolated from sewage at a pig 
farm in Nanning, China, on 14.5.2021. E. coli GXXW-
1103 was used for phage propagation and plaque count-
ing. Fifty milliliter sewage was centrifuged at 5000 × for 
10 min to remove debris pellet and this was repeated 3 
times. 3 ml of 1 ×  108 CFU/ml E. coli GXXW-1103 was 
mixed with 20  ml of the supernatant after centrifuga-
tion and incubated at 180 × g (37℃) for 18 h. In order to 
remove bacteria and leave phage, the resulting mixture 
was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and filtered with 
a 0.22 μm filter. Phage were detected by the conventional 
double-layered agar method and chosen a single phage 
plaque for further purification and amplification. The 
steps for phage purification were repeated three times 
before all plaques displayed the same morphology. The 
fltrate which we can utilize to determine plaque mor-
phology and plaqueforming units (PFUs) by the double-
layered agar method. Diluted it in SM buffer (5.8  g of 
NaCl, 2.0  g of MgSO4·7H2O, 50  mL of Tris–HCl [pH 
7.4], 5.0  ml of 2% gelatin). After being mixed with soft 
agar (LB broth,30 g and agar, 0.6% per liter) containing 
100 μL of E. coli GXXW-1103 pour the fltrate onto the 
LB agar plates. The soft-agar overlaid plates were incu-
bated at 37  °C for 12  h to count phage plaques which 
were estimated as a PFU.
The phage isolated and purified was named A221. For 
additional research, purified phages were kept in 20% 
glycerol at -80℃. Before administration, phage A221 was 
microencapsulated using a previously published pro-
tocol [14]. The preparation of phage microcapsules in 
this study was divided into two steps. The method has 
been modified as follows. First, accurately weigh 2.2 g of 
sodium alginate dissolved in 100 ml, 50 mM Tris–HCL 
(pH 7.5) solution, then add the appropriate amount of 
phage A221 suspension, stirring and mixing, the final 
concentration of phage is about  108 PFU/ml. The sodium 
alginate solution containing phage was dropped into cal-
cium chloride solution to form calcium alginate micro-
spheres, and then put into 0.4% (w/v) chitosan solution 
(pH 5.0) for encapsulation reaction (20 min at room tem-
perature). The microcapsules were collected, washed and 
soaked with deionized water, stored at 4 °C.The soluble 
powder of FFC was procured from Qilu Animal Health 
Page 11 of 14
Mao et al. BMC Veterinary Research          (2023) 19:165 
 
Products Co., Ltd. and dissolved by using sterile water. 
Freshly prepared with sterile water, filtered with the pore 
size of 0.22 μm before use.
Purchased the experimental animals from Nanning 
Fulu Farming Co., Ltd. 21-day-old piglets (n = 18, half 
female and half male, weighing 4.61–6.31 kg) were used 
in this study and were allowed to acclimatize for 1 day 
before commencement of experiments. These animals 
were fed a standard non-medicated ration for post- 
weaning pigs and had water ad libitum and maintained 
on a 12 h light/dark cycle.
Determination of host range of phage A221
Host range analysis of phage A221 was determined by the 
double-layer agar plate method [32]. In short,100 μL of 
overnight cultures of bacteria were taken and uniformly 
coated on LB medium plates (Tryptone 10  g/L; Yeast 
extract 5 g/L; NaCl 10 g/L). Then 5 μL of phage suspen-
sion  (109 PFU/ml) were apply dropwise to the surface of 
bacterial plate and saline was added dropwise as a con-
trol, incubated at 37 °C for 16–24 h. Clear and transpar-
ent lysis zone was produced as the judging standard. The 
test was repeated three times.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Used the transmission electron microscope to analyze the 
morphology of phage A221 [33]. 50 ml of the phage lysate 
(approximately  109 PFU/ml) was centrifuged (12,000 g in 
20 min), filtered (0.22 μm pore filter) and resuspended in 
0.1 mol/L ammonium acetate. The copper grid for TEM 
was immersed in phage A221 suspension for 10 min to 
deposit phage on the copper mesh, stained with 2% phos-
photungstic acid (PTA, 2% w/v) and dried. After this, the 
observed phage under a HITACHI HT-7700 transmis-
sion electron microscope (TEM, Hitachi High-Tech Co., 
Ltd, Tokyo, Japan).
Stability of phage A221 at different pH values and one‑step 
growth
The pH stability of phage ZH4 were evaluated using pre-
viously methods [34]. For pH stability testing, filtered 
high-titer phage A221 was mixed in a series of tubes 
containing SM buffer of different pH values (2.0–11.0, 
adjusted using NaOH or HCl), final concentration of 
phage was  109 PFU/ml, incubated for 2 h at 37 ◦C, and 
then titer by the double-layer agar plate method to deter-
mine the final concentration. The tests were repeated 
three times. One-step growth experiments were carried 
out by a modification of methods described elsewhere 
[35]. 100 μL of phage A221 (1 ×  107 PFU/ml) and GXXW-
1103 (1 ×  105 CFU/ml) were mixed with 3 ml LB broth 
and incubated at 37 °C warm bath for 15 min, centrifuged 
at 12,000  rpm for 1  min and discard the supernatant. 
Then, the precipitate was suspended in LB broth which 
had been pre-warmed to 37 ℃, followed by incubation 
at 37 ℃. 100 μL of samples were taken at 10 min inter-
vals (up to 120 min) and immediately diluted, and phage 
titers were then determined by the double-layered agar 
plate method. The calculation formula for burst size was: 
Burst size = phage titer at the end of lysis/number of host 
strains at the beginning of infection [36]. The tests were 
repeated three times.
Extraction of DNA and genome sequencing
Phage genomic DNA was extracted using a previ-
ously described method [36]. After the phage pellet was 
suspended in SM buffer, 20 μL 10% [w/v] SDS, 20 μL 
0.5 M EDTA, and 2.5 μL 20 ng/ml proteinase K (P1120, 
Solarbio, Beijing, China) were added and the mixture 
incubated at 65℃ for 1 h. An equal volume of phenol–
chloroform (1:1) was added to remove the proteinaceous 
material. The extraction was repeated twice, and the 
DNA was precipitated according to ethanol precipitation 
procedures. The pellet was dissolved in 30 μL of distilled 
water, and the isolated nucleic acids were separated using 
0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium 
bromide, and analyzed under ultraviolet (UV) light. After 
digestion, electrophoresis of the samples in 0.8% agarose 
containing ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml) was performed.
The construction of sequencing library and the control 
of sequencing data quality were performed by Personal-
bio (Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China). 
The tools of genome visualization chose the CGView 
Server and Easyfig_2.2.5_win. Comparative circular 
genome map of phage A221 genome was depicted by CG 
View Server [37].
In order to determine the similarity of A221 with other 
phages, the genomic sequence of A221 was used to per-
form the nucleotide BLAST program in NCBI. After that, 
similar phage genomes were downloaded from NCBI to 
determine the average nucleotide identity (ANI) using 
the Mummer alignment tool (ANIm). To further com-
pare the genome similarity, phage genomes similar to 
A221 were selected for global genome comparison. Lin-
ear comparison figure of multiple genomic loci was cre-
ated by Easy-fig_2.2.5_win based on BLAST [38].
The phylogenetic tree of the phage A221 was con-
structed based on DNA polymerase protein sequences by 
MEGA-7. After genome-wide blast, we selected homolo-
gous, different genera of the same family, and different 
families to construct a neighborhood evolutionary tree. 
The phylogenetic tree was generated in MEGA-7 using 
neighbor joining method with P distance values and 
bootstrap replicate of 1000 [39].

Effect of phage A221 on the growth of E. coli in vitro
The Infectivity of phage A221 was measured by bacte-
rial growth in broth. Briefly, 100 μl E. coli GXXW-1103 
 (106 CFU/ml) and 100 μL of phage suspension  (109 PFU/
ml,  107PFU/ml and  105PFU/ml, separately) were mixed in 
the 96-well plate. MOI of different groups were 1000, 10 
and 0.1. Separate Mueller–Hinton (MH) broth was used 
as negative control, and E. coli GXXW-1103 mixed MH 
broth was used as positive control. Then the mixtures 
were incubated with shaking at 180 rpm and 37℃. The 
ability of phage to inhibit the growth of strain was shown 
by measuring the  OD450nm of the mixture every hour for 
16 h at 37 ℃. This assay was performed in triplicate.
Determination of phage potency after microencapsulated
Prepared Microsphere-broken solution (MBS). Weighed 
14.7  g Trisodium citrate dihydrate (final concentration 
of 50  mM) and 16.8  g NaHCO3 (final concentration 
of 200 mM), dissolved in 1 L of SM buffer and filtered 
(0.22  μm pore filter). Take 1  g of microencapsulated 
phage, put into 9 ml of MBS, lysed at room temperature 
for 5 min. Detected the PFUs by the double-layered agar 
method in the cracking solution to calculate the potency 
of the phage encapsulated in microspheres. Repeat the 
test three times.
Animal experiments
Eighteen weaned piglets were divided into 4 groups: 3 
piglets for E. coli GXXW-1103 infected and with saline 
treatment (Infected); 6 piglets for E. coli GXXW-1103 
infected and with microencapsulated phage A221 treat-
ment (A221); 6 piglets for E. coli GXXW-1103 infected 
and with antibiotics Florfenicol (FFC) treatment (FFC); 
3 piglets without infection and with saline treatment 
(Non-infected). All piglets were orally infected with 3 ml 
of  106 CFU/ml E. coli GXXW-1103 per day during days 
2–5, except for non-infected group (all bacterial broths 
were freshly prepared the day before use, the OD of the 
bacterial broths was measured using a spectrophotom-
eter to standardize the concentration). During the next 
seven days, the piglets were orally treated with phage 
A221  (109 PFU/ml, 5 ml) once a day in the phage group 
(A221 group) and were orally treated with antibiotics 
FFC (0.14  g/kg) twice a day in antibiotics group (FFC 
group). After 7 days of treatment, the piglets were euth-
anized and necropsied. In order to give maximum wel-
fare to the experimental animals, we chose to anesthetize 
the experimental piglets with sodium pentobarbital at a 
dose of 100 mg/kg within 30 min and executed by sev-
ering the head. The tissues including spleen, caecum and 
jejunal lymph nodes were harvested for bacterial counts. 
The collected tissues were weighed and homogenized, 
diluted in a tenfold gradient, then evenly coated on EMB 
medium (Eosin-Methylene Blue medium) for incubation, 
and the number of E. coli was determined by taking the 
plate viable bacteria counting method, each dilution was 
coated three times. Parts of duodenum and caecum in 
every group were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and 
sent to Wuhan Servicebio Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, 
China) for histological analysis. In addition, duodenal 
contents from each piglet were collected in 1.5 ml sterile 
polypropylene tubes, immediately frozen in liquid nitro-
gen and then stored at -80°C until sent to Shanghai OE 
Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) for analysis of intes-
tinal flora, which focuses on the analysis of the relative 
abundance of different flora. All of the experiments were 
performed according to the guidelines of the regional 
Animal Ethics Committee and the rules for experimen-
tal animals of Guangxi University (GXU-2021–147 and 
GXU-2021–148).
