Abstract: Self-forming dynamic membrane (SFDM) formation is affected by a variety of operating
conditions. However, previous studies have only focused on individual inﬂuencing factors and a
systematic analysis of important factors is lacking. In this study, an aerobic self-forming dynamic
membrane bioreactor (SFDMBR) was developed for the treatment of domestic wastewater with the
critical factors that affect the effective formation of SFDM optimized, and the operational perfor-
mances under optimized formation conditions conﬁrmed. The results indicated that SFDM could
be formed within 5 min using 48 µm stainless-steel mesh as the supporting material at a sludge
concentration of 5–6 g/L and a gravity waterhead of 15 cm. And the SFDM formed could maintain
a stable ﬂux of 30–50 LMH, and the removals of COD, SCOD, and NH4+-N were 93.28%, 82.85%,
and 95.46%, respectively. Furthermore, the cake layer resistance (reversible fouling) contributed
to 95.93% of the total ﬁltration resistance, thus a simple physical cleaning can effectively restore
the ﬂux indicating a low-maintenance requirement. This study provides valuable insights into the
optimization and application of the SFDMBR process.

1. Introduction
Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) technology, combining the membrane separation with
biological treatment, is a cost-effective alternative for wastewater treatment [1,2]. Due to its
complete solid retention, superior efﬂuent quality, compact footprint, and selective control
over hydraulic retention time (HRT) and sludge retention time (SRT), the MBR technology
has been extensively used in the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater [3–5].
However, membrane fouling caused by the complex interactions between various foulants
and membrane materials reduces process efﬁciency, shortens membrane lifespan, and
increases operational costs [6,7].
The dynamic membrane bioreactor (DMBR) has garnered signiﬁcant interest re-
cently due to its ability to address the low ﬂux and easy fouling limitation related to
the MBR [8–10]. Dynamic membrane (DM) refers to the second membrane formed on
the supporting material when ﬁltering solution contains suspended particles [11]. The
primary difference between the supporting material used in the development of a DM and

a conventional membrane is membrane pore size, which ranges between 10 and 200 µm
and 0.1–1.0 µm in the DMBR and MBR. Higher ﬁltration ﬂux, ease of cleaning, and cost-
effectiveness make the DMBR increasingly competitive for wastewater and organic wastes
management with the assistance of various coarse-pore supporting materials [12]. Based on
the distinction in DM formation, DM can be classiﬁed as self-forming dynamic membranes
(SFDMs) or precoated dynamic membranes (PCDMs) [13]. PCDM is formed by pre-ﬁltering
a solution containing one or more colloidal components through the supporting mate-
rial [12,14,15]; SFDM is created when organic matter, colloids, and suspended solids in the
sludge mixture are naturally deposited on the surface of the supporting material during
the ﬁltration process. SFDM is more promising than PCDM for wastewater treatment since
PCDM requires additional pre-coating chemical and pre-coating process, which raises the
difﬁculties of practical application.
The development of a stable and resilient DM is a necessity for the removal of pollu-
tions from SFDMBR, as the well-formed cake layer is the only factor that inﬂuences this
process [16]. However, several variables, including pore size and supporting material,
sludge concentration, and driving force (waterhead in gravity-driven ﬁltration mode), play
an important role in the formation and steady operation of SFDM. Based on previous
studies, larger pore sizes of supporting material is known to lengthen the period that SFDM
production occurs (a process that results in low-quality efﬂuent), but smaller ones causes
serious membrane fouling [17,18]. Sabaghian et al. [19] reported that the formation of DM
took 120 min, 80 min, 40 min, and 5 min at sludge concentrations of 3 g/L, 5 g/L, 7 g/L,
and 9 g/L. And another study also reported that high concentration of MLSS contributed
to the rapid formation of DM [20]. One study showed that a gravity waterhead of 70 mm
promotes the rapid formation of SFDM and eliminates the enrichment of excess sludge on
the cake layer under high pressure [14]. Therefore, realizing rapid formation followed by a
stable operation of the SFDM by adjusting aforementioned parameters is crucial for the
development of SFDMBR. However, as known, the effects of a speciﬁc operating condition
on SFDM formation have been reported, but there is a lack of systematic analysis and
optimization of important factors to realize the rapid formation of SFDM and reduce the
membrane cleaning requirement.
Therefore, this study established a lab-scale gravity-driven SFDMBR to systematically
investigate the effects of supporting material, membrane pore size, sludge concentration,
and gravity waterhead on SFDM formation and stable operation. The study also discussed
the ﬁltration performance, pollutant removal, and properties of the SFDM under optimized
operational conditions. The results are expected to provide technical support for SFDMBR
wastewater treatment technology.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Wastewater, Sludge Inoculation and Supporting Materials
The SFDMBR was fed with the real domestic wastewater collected from the inlet
of a local wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Xi’an, China. The inﬂuent had a total
chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 526.73 ± 62.57 mg/L and soluble COD (SCOD) of
188.67 ± 9.75 mg/L, an ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) of 46.57 ± 2.95 mg/L, a total nitrogen
(TN) of 62.41 ± 3.07 mg/L, a total phosphorus (TP) 6.78 ± 0.65 mg/L, with the turbidity of
148 NTU on average during the operation period. The activated sludge for inoculation was
taken from the aerobic tank in the same WWTP adopting anaerobic-anoxic-oxic-MBR (AAO-
MBR) process. The mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) used in the batch experiments
were controlled at 3–4 g/L, 5–6 g/L, and 7–8 g/L, respectively, which were thickened by
gravity concentration and acclimated for two weeks before use. The supporting materials
used for SFDM formation were stainless steel mesh (pore size of 75, 48, and 25 µm),
polyester (pore size of 75 µm), screen silk (pore size of 75 µm), nylon mesh (pore size of
75 µm), and non-woven fabric (speciﬁc weight of 120 g/m2).

2.2. Experimental Setup and Operation Conditions
2.2.1. Reactor Setup and Operation
The lab-scale SFDMBR with a working volume of 9.8 L was established in the local
WWTP, with the schematic shown in Figure 1a. Two self-fabricated, ﬂat-sheet SFDM
modules were symmetrically submerged in the bioreactor, each having an effective ﬁltering
area of 0.02 m2. As shown in Figure 1b, the self-fabricated ﬂat-sheet SFDM module
was constructed with plexiglass for the frame, a grid-shaped, highly pressure-resistant
stainless-steel bracket for internal support, and corresponding membrane material wrapped
externally to create the appearance of a box with an interior cavity. The aeration system
was installed in the bottom of the bioreactor to provide shear force across the membrane
and dissolved oxygen (DO). Bottom aeration was regulated through gas ﬂowmeter to
provide DO requirements for microorganisms at 2–5 mg/L. The inﬂuent was pumped
into the bioreactor through a peristaltic pump (Longer BT-100, Baoding, China), and a
controller (JYB-714, Wenzhou, China) was connected to the inﬂuent pump to maintain a
relatively stable water level. Continuous efﬂuent was obtained under the gravity waterhead
differences between the water level and the outlet in bioreactor. The operating temperature
was maintained at 25 ± 1 ◦C

2.2. Experimental Setup and Operation Conditions 
2.2.1. Reactor Setup and Operation 
The lab-scale SFDMBR with a working volume of 9.8 L was established in the local 
WWTP, with the schematic shown in Figure 1a. Two self-fabricated, flat-sheet SFDM mod-
ules were symmetrically submerged in the bioreactor, each having an effective filtering 
area of 0.02 m2. As shown in Figure 1b, the self-fabricated flat-sheet SFDM module was 
constructed with plexiglass for the frame, a grid-shaped, highly pressure-resistant stain-
less-steel bracket for internal support, and corresponding membrane material wrapped 
externally to create the appearance of a box with an interior cavity. The aeration system 
was installed in the bottom of the bioreactor to provide shear force across the membrane 
and dissolved oxygen (DO). Bottom aeration was regulated through gas flowmeter to pro-
vide DO requirements for microorganisms at 2–5 mg/L. The influent was pumped into the 
bioreactor through a peristaltic pump (Longer BT-100, Baoding, China), and a controller 
(JYB-714, Wenzhou, China) was connected to the influent pump to maintain a relatively 
stable water level. Continuous effluent was obtained under the gravity waterhead differ-
ences between the water level and the outlet in bioreactor. The operating temperature was 
maintained at 25 ± 1 °C

ule. 
2.2.2. Batch Filtration Tests for Efficient SFDM Formation 
To maximize the SFDM formation conditions, a series of batch experiments based on 
single factor analysis and the control variable method (CVM) were developed. The four 
stages of the batch filtering experiments were membrane pore size optimization, sludge 
concentration optimization, gravity head optimization, and supporting material optimi-
zation. Firstly, as for the supporting materials, five distinct membrane materials (stainless 
steel mesh, polyester, silk sieve, nylon mesh, and non-woven fabric) were chosen. One 
membrane material was then ideally chosen based on the filtration performance, while 
other conditions are maintained as follows: a 75 μm membrane pore size, 3–4 g/L of sludge 
concentration, and a 10 cm gravity waterhead. Subsequently, the membrane pore sizes (75 
μm, 48 μm, and 25 μm) were altered based on the favored supporting material. Based on

2.2.2. Batch Filtration Tests for Efﬁcient SFDM Formation
To maximize the SFDM formation conditions, a series of batch experiments based
on single factor analysis and the control variable method (CVM) were developed. The
four stages of the batch ﬁltering experiments were membrane pore size optimization,
sludge concentration optimization, gravity head optimization, and supporting material
optimization. Firstly, as for the supporting materials, ﬁve distinct membrane materials
(stainless steel mesh, polyester, silk sieve, nylon mesh, and non-woven fabric) were chosen.
One membrane material was then ideally chosen based on the ﬁltration performance, while
other conditions are maintained as follows: a 75 µm membrane pore size, 3–4 g/L of
sludge concentration, and a 10 cm gravity waterhead. Subsequently, the membrane pore
sizes (75 µm, 48 µm, and 25 µm) were altered based on the favored supporting material.
Based on pollutants removal and ﬁltration performances, the ideal pore size was selected.
Afterwards, the sludge concentration was varied (3–4 g/L, 5–6 g/L, and 7–8 g/L) based
on the constant supporting material and membrane pore size, and the optimal sludge

concentration was determined based on the ﬁltration performance and pollutants removal.
Finally, to optimize the gravity waterhead, the process performance the SFDMBR was
compared under various gravity waterheads (10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm). For each batch
ﬁltration test, a fresh membrane module was used, and the ﬁltration time was set to 24 h to
guarantee the correctness of the results.
2.2.3. Continuous Operation of the SFDMBR
Following batch tests, the SFDMBR was operated for ﬁve continuous ﬁltration cycles
under optimal operating conditions. The ﬁltration cycle was set for 48 h, and at the end of
each cycle the mesh was physically cleaned by air back-ﬂushing (2 min with an air ﬂow rate
of 75 L/min) plus surface brushing (2 min) according to our previous work [21]. With the
exception of sampling for sludge characteristics study, no sludge was released, indicating
an inﬁnite SRT. To keep the DO concentration between 2 and 5 mg/L, the aeration intensity
was set to 2 L/min.
2.3. Analytical Methods
2.3.1. Water Sample Collection and Measurement
Water samples were collected at the end of each batch ﬁltration experiment and at
the end of each operational cycle (48 h). SCOD and NH4+-N was detected after samples
ﬁltrating through 0.45 µm ﬁlters. COD, SCOD, NH4+-N, TN, TP, MLSS, and mixed liquor
volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) were determined according to the standard methods [22].
The ﬁltration ﬂux (J, L/m2h, LMH) of the SFDM was calculated by measuring the permeate
volume (∆v, L) collected during a speciﬁed time interval (t, h) and a given membrane
area (A, 0.02 m2) (J = ∆V
A t). The turbidity of inﬂuent and efﬂuent was conducted with a
turbidity meter (TB 211 IR, Lovibond, German), DO was detected by using a DO meter
(JPBJ-608, Shanghai, China), and pH was measured using a portable pH meter (PHS-3C,
Shanghai, China).
2.3.2. SFDM Properties Analysis
The membrane module was carefully removed from the bioreactor, and then the SFDM
was collected for further analysis at the end of a long-term ﬁltration period according to
the previous studies [23]. In detail, the SFDM layer was scraped off by a plastic sheet
and transferred to a measuring cylinder containing pure water. The average thickness
was calculated according to the volume difference. In addition, the morphology and inor-
ganic elements of pre-treated SFDM were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope
(SEM, Quanta650FEG, FEI, USA) connected to an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX,
Quanta650FEG, FEI, USA).
Another SFDM module was used to determine the ﬁltration resistance distribution by
the following equation (Darcy’s Law) [16,24].
Rt = Rm + Rc + Rp = ∆P/µ
Rc = Rt − Rm − Rp
where Rt is the total resistance of the SFDM layer (m−1); Rm is the intrinsic resistance of
the stainless steel mesh (m−1), which was measured as the new membrane module in
pure water; Rc is the cake layer resistance (m−1), which can be obtained by subtracting
the ﬁltration resistance of Rm and Rp from Rt; Rp is the pore blocking resistance (m−1),
calculated by subtracting Rm from Rt after air back-ﬂushing plus surface brushing; ∆P is
the gravity waterhead induced hydrodynamic pressure; µ is the viscosity of the permeate
(Pa·s); and J is the ﬁltration ﬂux (m/s).

2.3.3. Statistical Analysis
The IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 software (international Business Machines Co., Armonk,
NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Speciﬁcally, the average values and stan-
dard deviations (±SD) were determined. Graphics and error bars were drawn using
Origin2021 software.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Optimization of SFDM Supporting Material
Selection of an appropriate supporting material enabling the formation of a DM is
a critical step for SFDMBR application. For the batch ﬁltration tests, stainless steel mesh,
nylon mesh, polyester, silk sieve (pore size of 75 µm), and 120 g/m2 non-woven fabric were
chosen as the supporting materials. Variation in ﬁltration ﬂux and efﬂuent turbidity using
different supporting materials were shown in Figure 2. Initial ﬁltration ﬂux of stainless-
steel mesh, nylon mesh, sieve silk, polyester, and non-woven fabrics was 585, 456, 498,
420, and 777 LMH. The ﬁltration ﬂow decreased to 192, 207, 195, 195, and 297 LMH after
ﬁve minutes later, respectively. The ﬁltration ﬂux of the ﬁve supporting materials was
attenuated to about 40% of the initial ﬂuxes in the ﬁrst 5 min, indicating the formation of
SFDM layer on the mesh surface and decrease in ﬁltration ﬂux along with the operation
time. Afterwards, the decreasing rates of ﬂux slowed down, as the stable ﬂux at the end of
operation for the ﬁve supporting materials was 33, 27, 33, 30, and 36 LMH, respectively.

five minutes later, respectively. The filtration flux of the five supporting materials was 
attenuated to about 40% of the initial fluxes in the first 5 min, indicating the formation of 
SFDM layer on the mesh surface and decrease in filtration flux along with the operation 
time. Afterwards, the decreasing rates of flux slowed down, as the stable flux at the end 
of operation for the five supporting materials was 33, 27, 33, 30, and 36 LMH, respectively.

circle corresponds to each horizontal coordinate in the 3D plot. 
The trend of effluent turbidity altered in agreement with the flux, as shown in Figure 
2b (fast drop to stabilization). The influent turbidity varied between 140 and 170 NTU; 
however, the effluent turbidity of the five membrane materials decreased dramatically 
after 5 min to 3.78, 4.76, 4.75, 3.89, and 4.08 NTU, respectively. According to the previous 
studies [20,21,23], it was reported that effluent turbidity below 5 NTU was defined as an 
indicator of SFDM formation, thus five supporting materials could form SFDM within 5 
min. The effluent turbidity after SFDM formation was relatively stable, and decreased

corresponds to each horizontal coordinate in the 3D plot.
The trend of efﬂuent turbidity altered in agreement with the ﬂux, as shown in Figure 2b
(fast drop to stabilization). The inﬂuent turbidity varied between 140 and 170 NTU;
however, the efﬂuent turbidity of the ﬁve membrane materials decreased dramatically
after 5 min to 3.78, 4.76, 4.75, 3.89, and 4.08 NTU, respectively. According to the previous
studies [20,21,23], it was reported that efﬂuent turbidity below 5 NTU was deﬁned as an
indicator of SFDM formation, thus ﬁve supporting materials could form SFDM within
5 min. The efﬂuent turbidity after SFDM formation was relatively stable, and decreased
slowly with the ﬁltration time. When the efﬂuent turbidity was reduced to less than 2 NTU,
Water 2023, 15, 3963

it represented the formation of stabilized SFDM [25]. Therefore, for stainless steel mesh,
nylon mesh, sieve silk, and polyester, 7 h was noted for efﬂuent turbidity declining below
2 NTU and longer time for non-woven fabric.
Stainless steel mesh, silk sieve, and non-woven fabric had greater stable ﬂux. However,
non-woven fabric took longer to generate stable SFDM and was more difﬁcult to clean.
Stainless steel mesh was chosen as the supporting material for effective SFDM construction
because it had a solid structure that could sustain the necessary pressure for an extended
period of time and could be reused after membrane cleaning.
3.2. Optimization of Membrane Pore Size
Large pore size supporting material might worsen the quality of the efﬂuent during
the startup phase or following membrane cleaning. Additionally, it took them a fair
amount of time to create an efﬁcient SFDM. However, membrane fouling requires frequent
membrane cleaning for the supporting material with smaller pore size. As a result, the
supporting material should have an appropriate pore size to balance SFDM formation and
membrane fouling.
As shown in Figure 3a,b, using stainless steel mesh with different pore size (75 µm,
48 µm, and 25 µm) as the supporting materials, the ﬁltration ﬂux, and efﬂuent turbidity
were measured to further explore the effect of pore size on SFDM formation. Initially, there
were 585, 515, and 450 LMH in the 75, 48, and 25 µm stainless steel mesh, respectively.
Afterwards, 25 µm stainless steel mesh tended to be blocked by sludge particles, causing
a faster decrease in the ﬁltration ﬂux. The beneﬁt of high ﬂux operation was lost for the
SFDMBR when the ﬁltration ﬂux of 25 µm stainless steel mesh dropped to 18 LMH at the
conclusion of operation; however, for 75 and 48 µm stainless steel mesh, the ﬁltration ﬂux
at the conclusion of a 24 h operation was 33 and 33 LMH, respectively. Thus, membrane
fouling was signiﬁcantly lower than 25 µm stainless steel mesh, which is consistent with
other ﬁndings [17,18]. It is noteworthy that the SFDM formation time could be shortened
for smaller pore size, as evidenced by the fact that 75 µm stainless steel mesh required
120 min to achieve efﬂuent turbidity lower than 2 NTU (deﬁned as an indicator of stable
SFDM formation), whereas 48 and 25 µm stainless steel mesh required 80 and 50 min,
respectively [14,26]. Following stable SFDM formation, no discernible variation in efﬂuent
turbidity was noted for varying pore sizes.
The COD and SCOD removal of stainless-steel mesh with different pore sizes (75 µm,
48 µm, and 25 µm) were shown in Figure 3c. For three membrane pore sizes of stainless-
steel mesh, the inﬂuent COD was 242.95, 303.7, and 288.35 mg/L, while the inﬂuent SCOD
was 149.8, 92.74, and 96.78 mg/L, in that order. Moreover, 51.98, 35.61, and 34.95 mg/L of
COD and 48.97, 35.09, and 33.75 mg/L of SCOD were found in the efﬂuent. The efﬂuent
COD from the 75 µm stainless steel mesh was signiﬁcantly greater than that of the other
meshes; however, Sahinkaya [10] and Meng [27] reported the efﬂuent COD was not affected
by pore size after SFDM formation. This might be explained by the fact that the SFDM
performed a poor job of retaining SCOD, and the high SCOD concentration in the inﬂuent
during the batch tests conducted with 75 µm stainless steel mesh. Thus, considering the
stable ﬂux, SFDM formation time, and COD removal, 48 µm was regarded as the most
suitable pore size for SFDM formation.

μm): (a) filtration flux; (b) effluent turbidity; (c) COD and SCOD removal. 
3.3. Optimization of MLSS Concentration 
The filtration flux in the SFDMBR at MLSS concentrations of 3–4 g/L, 5–6 g/L, and 7–
8 g/L was shown in Figure 4a. The initial flux of the SFDMBRs was 507, 303, and 204 LMH, 
respectively. Due to the rapid deposition of sludge particles on the stainless-steel mesh, 
the filtration flux rapidly decreased to 162, 147, and 132 LMH within 5 min. Afterwards, 
the decreasing rate of filtration flux slowed down along with the operation time, as the 
filtration flux dropped to 27, 24, and 15 LMH at end of operation. The filtration flux was 
significantly lower at 7–8 g/L MLSS concentration in comparison to those of 3–4 g/L and 
5–6 g/L MLSS concentration. As the MLSS concentration increased, more particles would 
be further deposited on the DM layer; as a result, membrane pore size was blocked caus-
ing the decrease in filtration flux [28,29]. As shown in Figure 4b, the initial turbidity of the 
SFDMBR was 21.5, 29.9, and 14.8 NTU, respectively. All of them could be reduced to less 
than 5 NTU in 5 min. However, the initial formation of the SFDM was not stable, the ef-
fluent turbidity was influenced by aeration in the SFDMBR. The effluent turbidity fluctu-
ated from 2.88 NTU to 4.53 NTU at 3–4 g/L MLSS concentration; however, there was no 
obvious fluctuation of effluent turbidity at higher MLSS concentration (5–6 g/L and 7–8 
g/L), showing that the formation of SFDM with higher sludge concentration was more

was required for SFDM formation at different MLSS concentrations (3–4 g/L, 5–6 g/L, and 
7–8 g/L). However, the stable effluent turbidity of the SFDMBR was not the lowest at the

3.3. Optimization of MLSS Concentration
The ﬁltration ﬂux in the SFDMBR at MLSS concentrations of 3–4 g/L, 5–6 g/L, and
7–8 g/L was shown in Figure 4a. The initial ﬂux of the SFDMBRs was 507, 303, and
204 LMH, respectively. Due to the rapid deposition of sludge particles on the stainless-
steel mesh, the ﬁltration ﬂux rapidly decreased to 162, 147, and 132 LMH within 5 min.
Afterwards, the decreasing rate of ﬁltration ﬂux slowed down along with the operation time,
as the ﬁltration ﬂux dropped to 27, 24, and 15 LMH at end of operation. The ﬁltration ﬂux
was signiﬁcantly lower at 7–8 g/L MLSS concentration in comparison to those of 3–4 g/L
and 5–6 g/L MLSS concentration. As the MLSS concentration increased, more particles
would be further deposited on the DM layer; as a result, membrane pore size was blocked
causing the decrease in ﬁltration ﬂux [28,29]. As shown in Figure 4b, the initial turbidity
of the SFDMBR was 21.5, 29.9, and 14.8 NTU, respectively. All of them could be reduced
to less than 5 NTU in 5 min. However, the initial formation of the SFDM was not stable,
the efﬂuent turbidity was inﬂuenced by aeration in the SFDMBR. The efﬂuent turbidity
ﬂuctuated from 2.88 NTU to 4.53 NTU at 3–4 g/L MLSS concentration; however, there was
no obvious ﬂuctuation of efﬂuent turbidity at higher MLSS concentration (5–6 g/L and
7–8 g/L), showing that the formation of SFDM with higher sludge concentration was more
stable, and the ability to resist hydrodynamic disturbance. A total of 150, 30 and 20 min
was required for SFDM formation at different MLSS concentrations (3–4 g/L, 5–6 g/L,
and 7–8 g/L). However, the stable efﬂuent turbidity of the SFDMBR was not the lowest

and 7–8 g/L): (a) filtration flux; (b) effluent turbidity; (c) COD and SCOD removal. 
As shown in Figure 4c, influent COD fluctuated between 320 and 550 mg/L, and the 
SCOD was in the range of 100–170 mg/L. At the end of operation, effluent COD at three 
different sludge concentrations was 72.61 (3–4 g/L), 52.37 (5–6 g/L), and 45.31 mg/L (7–8 
g/L); effluent SCOD was 72.01, 48.44, and 43.35 mg/L, respectively. The corresponding 
COD removal was 77.71%, 89.61%, and 91.75%, and the SCOD removal was 55.89%, 
55.88%, and 65.17%, respectively. On the one hand, as the MLSS concentration increased, 
more COD could be degraded by abundant microorganisms. On the other hand, the 
SFDM layer formed under high MLSS concentration was more denser, so more COD was 
retained and degraded, which was in agreement with previous studies reported that 
sludge concentration below 5 g/L resulted in inadequate biodegradation [30,31]. 
In summary, the MLSS of 5–6 g/L concentration was more preferable to promote ef-
ficient SFDM formation because of the shorter duration for SFDM formation, the reduced 
propensity for pore blockage, as well as the stable and robust in dynamic membrane struc-
ture.

3.4. Optimization of Gravity Waterhead
As seen in Figure 5a, the ﬁltration ﬂux of SFDM in various gravity waterheads,
including 10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm was examined. With the gravity waterhead increasing
from 10 cm to 30 cm, the initial ﬂux increased from 303 LMH to 660 LMH, indicating that
hydrodynamics had a major role in determining the initial ﬂux prior to SFDM formation.
The highest ﬂux decreased was observed at 30 cm waterhead, as the ﬁltration ﬂux at the
30 cm gravity waterhead decreased to 147 LMH after 5 min; however, which decreased
to 162 LMH at 20 cm gravity waterhead. At the end of the 24 h operation, the ﬁltration
ﬂux under the three gravity waterhead dropped to 18, 21 and 15 LMH, respectively, so it
was obvious that there was no direct correlation between the gravity waterhead and the
stable ﬂux after the formation of SFDM. This might be due to the strong compaction effect
of the greater waterhead on the SFDM, resulting in an increase in the DM thickness and
pore-clogging propensity, and a decrease in the membrane porosity [32,33].

3.4. Optimization of Gravity Waterhead 
As seen in Figure 5a, the filtration flux of SFDM in various gravity waterheads, in-
cluding 10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm was examined. With the gravity waterhead increasing 
from 10 cm to 30 cm, the initial flux increased from 303 LMH to 660 LMH, indicating that 
hydrodynamics had a major role in determining the initial flux prior to SFDM formation. 
The highest flux decreased was observed at 30 cm waterhead, as the filtration flux at the

162 LMH at 20 cm gravity waterhead. At the end of the 24 h operation, the filtration flux 
under the three gravity waterhead dropped to 18, 21 and 15 LMH, respectively, so it was 
obvious that there was no direct correlation between the gravity waterhead and the stable 
flux after the formation of SFDM. This might be due to the strong compaction effect of the 
greater waterhead on the SFDM, resulting in an increase in the DM thickness and pore-
clogging propensity, and a decrease in the membrane porosity [32,33].

As shown in Figure 5b, initial efﬂuent turbidity was 29.4, 31.0, and 29.9 NTU at 10,
20 and 30 cm gravity waterhead, respectively. A total of 10, 5, and 3 min was required for
efﬂuent turbidity decreasing below 5 NTU, respectively, suggesting that SFDM formation
was accelerated under higher gravity waterhead. In addition, the efﬂuent turbidity under
high gravity waterhead lose was signiﬁcantly decreased at the initial stage (the initial
efﬂuent turbidity under 30 cm waterhead is lower than those of 20 and 10 cm) due to the
compaction and thickening of the DM. The COD and SCOD removal at different gravity
waterhead were shown in Figure 5c. The COD removal under three gravity waterhead
was 87.08%, 88.31%, and 90.82%, and the SCOD removal was 56.50%, 66.96%, and 69.77%,
respectively. The removal efﬁciency of SCOD at 20 cm and 30 cm gravity waterhead was
signiﬁcantly higher than that at 10 cm, which might be due to the fact that the more stable
the SFDM structure formed under the higher waterhead [34,35].
Based on the ﬁltration performance and COD removal, it can be concluded that the
gravity waterhead for efﬁcient SFDM formation was between 10 and 20 cm, thus gravity
waterhead of 10, 15, and 20 cm were selected and operated for 3 d to further determine
the optimum gravity waterhead. As shown in Figure 6, consistent with the results of the
above tests, the ﬁltration ﬂux was positively related to the gravity waterhead in the initial
stage. But after the SFDM formation, the ﬁltration ﬂux at the end of the 3 d operation
decreased to 24 LMH at 15 cm gravity waterhead, and the ﬁltration ﬂux was 15 LMH and
12 LMH at 20 cm and 10 cm gravity waterhead, indicating that the SFDM layer was severely
consolidated at greater waterhead causing the decrease in the porosity and ﬁltration ﬂux.
The efﬂuent turbidity during the initial SFDM formation stage was lowest at 20 cm gravity
waterhead; however, the efﬂuent turbidity during the stabilization stage was lowest at
15 cm gravity waterhead. This might because that the rate of SFDM formation increased
during the initial stage at high waterhead, and therefore the turbidity decreased at a
faster rate; however, after stabilization of the SFDM formation, too many particles escaped
through the DM into the efﬂuent under 20 cm waterhead. The inﬂuent COD at 10, 15, and
20 cm gravity waterhead was 481.11, 574.71, and 536.73 mg/L, and the efﬂuent COD was
41.96, 40.33, and 36.67 mg/L, and the COD removal rate was 91.26%, 92.97%, and 93.17%
on average. To sum up, 15 cm was ﬁnally selected as the optimal gravity waterhead for
SFDM formation under the operational conditions in this work.

3.5.1. Filtration Performance
The ﬁltration ﬂux and efﬂuent turbidity of during ﬁve consecutive operation cycles
of the SFDMBR under optimized condition (48 µm stainless steel mesh, 5–6 g/L MLSS
concentration and 15 cm gravity waterhead) were shown in Figure 7. The constant pressure
ﬁltration mode driven by an average gravity waterhead of 15 cm resulted in a gradual
decrease in the ﬁltration ﬂux. The initial ﬂux varied between 401 and 428 LMH during ﬁve
consecutive ﬁltration cycles. Then, after 5 min the ﬁltration ﬂux was quickly reduced to
148–192 LMH, consistent with previous study showing that the ﬁltration ﬂux halved during
SFDM formation stage [23]. The ﬁnal stabilized ﬂux could be maintained at 30–50 LMH,
which was higher than the reported results of 4.2–16 LMH [36]. For most ﬁltration cycles,
it was noted that the ﬂux recovery after physical cleaning was nearly 100%, indicating a
combined physical cleaning (air backwashing plus surface brushing) could be effective in
membrane cleaning for SFDM regeneration [37].

SFDM could be formed with 5 min under the optimized condition and the formed SFDM
was stable in structure evidenced by stabilized ﬂux and efﬂuent turbidity.

In this study, the average concentrations of common pollutants (including COD, 
SCOD, NH4+-N, TN, and TP) in the influent and effluent as well as removal rates during 
continuous SFDMBR operation period were shown in Figure 8 (similar SFDMBR perfor-
mance listed in Table S2). The results showed that the influent COD was 526.73 mg/L, and 
the effluent COD was 35.65 mg/L, and the removal efficiency of COD was as high as 
93.28% on average. The retention effect of the efficiently formed SFDM and biodegrada-
tion both contributed to organics removal. Yang et al. [36] reported that the COD removal 
rate was 88%, but the removal rate of SCOD was only 68% in SFDMBR system. However, 
the COD removal in this investigation was as high as 82.58%, which might be because the 
more stable SFDM structure created under optimal conditions enhanced SCOD retention. 
The NH4+-N removal rate was as high as 95.46% due to the efficient nitrification process 
under the complete aerobic condition, whereas the removal rate of TN was only 21.83%,

3.5.3. Properties of the Dynamic Membrane 
Photographs of membrane modules, and SEM images and EDX analysis of pristine 
mesh and SFDM layer under optimized conditions were shown in Figure 9a. The yellow-
brown sludge layer on the surface of the supporting material of the membrane module at 
the end of one operation cycle could be visualized, indicating the effective formation of 
SFDM. The thickness of this cake layer was determined to be 1.5 mm, so it could effectively 
retain the particulate matter and provide sufficient biodegradation of entrapped pollu-
tants. The SEM images showed that the pristine membrane was distributed with even and 
clear micropores. Sludge particles and microbial cells could be observed in the SFDM [13]. 
Moreover, the morphology of the SFDM was rough and porous, thus the SFDM formed 
under the optimized conditions could maintain a high and stable flux. 
The inorganic elements of pristine mesh and SFDM were revealed by EDX analysis. 
The following elemental composition was detected in the SFDM, and the relative weight 
percentages of the elementals were presented as follows: 47.11% C, 10.07% N, 17.48 O, 
0.37% Mg, 0.18% Na, 0.22% Al, 1.15% Si, 5.59% P, 3.03% S, 1.51% Cl, 0.92% K, 3.78% Ca, 
3.32% Cr, and 6.28% Fe. The relative content of the elements of C, N, and O was close to 
the molecular formula of microbial cells (C5H7O2N) and the molecular formula of proteins 
(C16H24O5N4) according to a previous study [13]. This might indicate that the SFDM layer 
consists mainly of microorganisms and microbial metabolites. According to the previous 
work, although the contents of some metal elements (e.g., Mg, Al, Fe and Ca) accounted 
for a relatively small percentage, they could bridge the biopolymers and deposited mi-
crobes enhancing the formation of cake layer [39,40]. Further analysis of SFDM composi-
tion using FTIR analysis was carried out to reveal the main functional groups of the or-
ganic matter in the SFDM (Figure 9b). The peaks at 2974 cm−1 and 2979 cm−1 corresponded 
to C-H stretching. The peaks at 1660 cm−1, 1546 cm−1, 1388 cm−1, and 1231 cm−1 corre-
sponded to amide Ⅰ, amide Ⅱ, and amide Ⅲ, respectively [41]. And the peak at 1066 cm−1 
corresponded to the C-O stretching of PS or PS-like substances [42]. The stretching of these 
peaks further indicates that the main organic components in the SFDM layer are PN and 
PS.

Figure 9. (a) SEM images and EDX analysis; pristine mesh and SFDM; (b) FTIR spectrum of SFDM. 
The filtration resistance distribution of SFDM was further analyzed, as shown in Ta-
ble 1. The total filtration resistance (Rt) of SFDM was calculated to be 1.72 × 1011 m−1 at the 
end of filtration cycle, and this value was one to three orders of magnitude lower than 
those commonly observed in conventional MBRs (1012–1014 m−1) [43]. The intrinsic re-
sistance (Rm) of the stainless-steel mesh (pore size of 48 μm) was 4.5 × 109 m−1, which ac-
counted for 1.33% of the total filtration resistance. Furthermore, the cake layer resistance 
(Rc) was 1.65 × 1011 m−1, accounting for 95.93% of the total resistance, with pore blocking 
resistance (Rp) of 0.47 × 1010 m−1 which was far less than the cake layer resistance. It meant 
that cake layer resistance was the major filtration resistance and membrane flux could be 
effectively restored only by simple physical cleaning due to the reversible nature of cake 
layer, and the pore resistance contributing much to filtration resistance in the MBRs could 
be effectively avoided in the SFDMBRs. It is worth noting that the SFDMBR showing 
lower filtration resistance and higher permeability is easy to clean compared with the 
MBR, but the membrane fouling cannot be avoided after a long-term operation. Thus,

tration of 5–6 g/L and a gravity waterhead of 15 cm. Porous SFDM with a thickness of
1.5 mm formed under optimized conditions, allowing for efﬁcient ﬁltration performance
and pollutants removal at a high steady-state ﬁltration ﬂux (30–50 LMH). Additionally,
near 100% cake layer resistance indicated that the ﬂux can be efﬁciently restored via simple
physical cleaning methods. These results provided a helpful reference for the development
and application of the low-cost SFDMBR process with limited maintenance requirement.
Towards large-scale applications of the SFDMBR, artiﬁcial intelligence (such as machine
learning methods) might be used to further analyze the SFDM ﬁltration process and to
optimize the SFDM formation conditions and fouling mitigation strategies.
