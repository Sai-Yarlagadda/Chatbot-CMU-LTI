P53 protein is the product of P53 gene, which is a well acknowledged tumor
suppressor gene. The function of P53 and the relevant mechanisms of anti-
neoplasm have raised the interest of researchers since many years ago. It is
demonstrated that P53 is a basic cell cycle regulator and a strong inhibitor for
versatile cancers in humans. However, most research focuses on other organs
and systems instead of the central nervous system (CNS). In fact, in recent years,
more and more studies have been suggesting that P53 plays a signiﬁcant role in
multiple CNS tumors and other diseases and disorders such as cerebral stroke
and neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we mainly reviewed the P53’s
relationship with CNS tumors, cerebral stroke and neurodegenerative diseases,
together with the relevant mechanisms, aiming to summarize the research
achievements and providing new insight to the future study on diseases in CNS.

1 Introduction
The P53 gene, with the full name of Tp53 gene, is a well acknowledged tumor
suppressor gene and thus thoroughly and repeatedly studied in numerous cancer types all
over the human body and even in other diverse mammals. Its protein product, with the
molecular weight of 53 kDa, therefore got its name. The expression and structure of P53 is
relatively constant and conservative in mammals and other organisms. For the past
decades, researchers have proven that it is an important cell cycle checker and a
cornerstone to impact almost all cancers in humans. This study reviewed the current
knowledge we have acquired from P53 and its relationship with CNS diseases including
gliomas, cerebral stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the relevant
mechanisms involving the regulation of apoptosis, ferroptosis and inﬂammation were
reviewed and discussed.
Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant and aggressive brain tumors in
humans. The treatment for it, unfortunately, no progress can be seen till recent years.
Whether it is surgical resection or combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, there
has been no signiﬁcant improvement in the prognosis of high grade or recurrent gliomas.
It is well known that P53 can regulate apoptosis, thus theoretically it is able to inhibit the

proliferation of gliomas (Hernández Borrero and El-Deiry,
2021). Though less reported, we believe that P53 may have
the potential to play a role in the treatment of gliomas.
Cerebral stroke is clinically divided into two types: ischemic
stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. The former has the highest
incidence, and is due to the brain blood insufﬁciency or cut-
off, resulting in brain tissue damage and massive neuronal
deaths. Although hemorrhagic stroke has lower incidence
compared to the ischemic one, it is with higher mortality and
severer clinical outcome (Zhang et al., 2022). In stroke, reducing
the death of neurons is a treatment plan that can improve the
prognosis of patients (Zhang et al., 2022). By regulating the
expression of P53 to increase the survival of neuronal cells, it
might be used as a molecular-targeted treatment after stroke.
Neurodegenerative diseases are a cluster of diseases involving
CNS and can be characterized by sensorimotor function
impairment,
memory
loss
and
dementia,
among
which
Alzheimer’s
disease
(AD),
Parkinson’s
disease
(PD),
Huntington’s disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) are most common in clinical practice. The shared
pathological changes in such diseases are atrophy of cerebral
lobes, loss of neurons and synapses and accumulation of
abnormal proteins in neurons or brain parenchyma such as
amyloid
beta
(Aβ),
tau
protein
and
Lewy
bodies.
Neurodegenerative
diseases
are
now
considered
to
be
incurable and the mechanisms behind are still unknown.
However, via countless research, it is revealed that apoptosis,
ferroptosis and neuroinﬂammation may play a fundamental role
in them.
2 P53 structure
2.1 Wild-type P53 structure
The P53 protein structure includes ﬁve main parts: the
reverse activation domain, the proline-rich domain, the DNA
binding domain, the tetramer domain and the regulatory domain
(Harris, 1996a).
The protein P53 has been proven to have transcription
activation function that may be located at the amino terminal
residues 1–42 (Lin et al., 1994). The reverse activation domain
may be related to the tumor inhibitory function of P53, because
the mutated P53 protein of many tumor patients have lost both
transcription activation activity and tumor suppressor activity
(Raycroft et al., 1990). This domain also can mediate the
interaction between P53 and some basic transcription factors,
like TATA-binding protein (TBP) (Liu et al., 1993).
The proline-rich domain has proved to have little to do with
transcriptional activation, but the absence of this domain has
weakened the ability of P53 to inhibit the growth of tumor cells
in vitro (Walker and Levine, 1996). P53 proline-rich domain
plays a key role in inhibiting signal transmission downstream of
P53 protein and can be associated with signaling pathways
transduction. Research shows that the domain participates in
growth suppression cell signal transmission (Walker and Levine,
1996).
The
P53
protein
is
a
tetrameric
transcription
factor.
Oligomerization
appears
to
be
essential
for
the
tumor
suppressing activity of P53 because oligomerization-deﬁcient
P53 mutants cannot suppress the growth of carcinoma cell lines
(Jeffrey et al., 1995; Kato et al., 2003). The DNA binding domain
(DBD) is key point of P53 for functioning. Experiments show
in vitro that it is composed of the basis of two decamers
RRRCWWGYYY (n) RRRCWWGYYY (R = purine, C =
cytosine, W = adenine or thymine, G = guanine, Y =
pyrimidine, and n means 0–13 bases) (Jordan et al., 2008;
Hernández Borrero and El-Deiry, 2021). Through this domain,
P53 acts as a transcription factor in a sequence-speciﬁc way by
identifying the P53 reaction element (el-Deiry et al., 1992). Another
area is the regulatory domain (RD), which can combine with PUMA
and MDM2 to produce corresponding changes (Figure 1).
2.2 Common structure mutation of P53
In P53 mutants, missense mutations are one of the most
common mutation types, which are divided into DNA contact
mutants and structural mutants. The ﬁrst type of mutant, such
as the P53-R273H mutant, can be replaced with residues in
direct contact with DNA (Hainaut and Pfeifer, 2016). This
kind of mutant may not shake the structure of P53. However,
it may destruct the heat-stability. The mutant is characterized
by the core unfolding area compared to the wild type. Another
type of mutation is amino acid substitution that can destroy
the core folding area, such as the P53-R175H mutation, which
will lead to changes in the structure of P53. In humans, the
replacement of codons 175 and 273 is one of the most
common
mutations
(Bykov
et
al.,
2018).
In
previous
experiments, it has suggested that the mutations of R175H
and R273H subverted the ability to bind zinc ions, and the
function of P53 can be restored after treatment with zinc ion
metallochaperones (Garuﬁ et al., 2013). The mutated P53 will
combine with wild P53 to make it inactive and no longer have
tumor inhibitory function (Hernández Borrero and El-Deiry,
2021) (Figure 1).
3 Regulation of P53
As is known, the common post-translation modiﬁcations
(PTM) include: phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitinization,
methylation,
demethylation
and
glycosylation
(Hernández
Borrero and El-Deiry, 2021). These modiﬁcations play an
important role in stabilizing and activiting P53 (Brooks and
Gu, 2003).

3.1 Phosphorylation
Phospholation is a modiﬁcation of the P53 protein after
translation, which can be phosphorylated on multiple amino
acids in the N-terminal transcriptional activation area of the
protein
(Nakamizo
et
al.,
2008).
Post-translational
modiﬁcation of P53 through phosphorylation is considered
to be an important mechanism to regulate the stability and
function of P53. Moreover, the phosphorylation of P53 plays
an important role in regulating activities such as DNA binding
(Ashcroft et al., 1999). Most importantly, the phosphorylation
of P53 plays an important role in regulating its activity. For

example, it can actively regulate the transcriptional activity of
many transcription factors, including c-jun, CREB and NF-
IL6/LAP, and regulate the stability of other proteins such as
c-jun and NF-κB. Several serine residues of P53 protein in
amino and carboxyl end regions are phosphorylated by some
cytokinases
(Unger
et
al.,
1999).
Phosphorylation
and
acetylation of P53 can interrupt negative regulatory factors
(Chao et al., 2006).
The experimental results show that the simulated structural
phosphorylation
P53
constructor
(Ad-P53-18D20D)
at
Thr18 and Ser20 can induce G1 stagnation of normal cell
strains after exogenous non-phosphorylation P53 (Ad-P53)
administration, indicating that the phosphorylation of P53 at
Thr18 and Ser20 is enough to induce P53-mediated glioma cell
apoptosis (Nakamizo et al., 2008). Experiments have also shown
that Ser18 and 23 phosphorylation is required for P53-dependent
apoptosis and tumor suppression in mice (Chao et al., 2006).
Therefore,
the
regulation
of
phosphorylation
after
P53 translation may offer a potential treatment strategy in the
treatment of tumors.
3.2 Ubiquitinization
Ubiquitin is a polypeptide composed of 72 amino acids. It
can modify the translated proteins, and the most common
function of ubiquitin modiﬁcation is to target the degradation
of substrate protein through the proteasome. The covalent
connection process of ubiquitin is called ubiquitinization
(Pickart, 2001). MDM2 is a ubiquitin ligase and exhibits
the negative regulating effect on P53 (Watson and Irwin,
2006). Both MDM2 and MDMX can negatively regulate the
transcription activity and stability of P53. MDM2 is the target
of P53 transcription. As a ubiquitin ligase, P53 is ubiquitinized
by MDMX, which is a kind of PTM that damages the function
of P53 (Joerger and Fersht, 2016; Kwon et al., 2017).
Therefore,
blocking
the
interaction
between
P53
and
MDM2 can stabilize it, leading to the cessation of the cell
cycle and preventing the further development of the tumor. It
also provides strategies for molecular treatment of tumors
(Vassilev et al., 2004). MDM2 is functioning in three
pathways, as the negative regulator of P53. The ﬁrst is to
combine
P53
with
its
activation
area
to
inhibit
its
transcription ability (Linke et al., 2008). The second is to
participate in the nuclear output of P53. Third, it promotes the
degradation of P53 as a ubiquitin ligase (Michael and Oren,
2003). Some scholars used small-molecule inhibitor to
suppress the MDM2-P53 complex and proved that in
mouse, P53 could be activated and tumor growth be
suppressed
(Vassilev
et
al.,
2004;
Zhao
et
al.,
2015).
Experiments show that MDM2 antagonists promote cell
growth inhibition and apoptosis, which brings potential
value to the treatment of tumors (Tortora et al., 2000).
3.3 Acetylation
Acetylation can modify the lysine (K) residue at C-terminal
of P53, which is an important modiﬁcation site after the
transcription of P53. The C-terminal regulation domain of six
lysine residues of P53 (K370 K372 K373 K381 K382 K386) can be
targeted by MDM2. Acetylated modiﬁcation can cause the
transcription activity of P53 to be activated and increase its
stability. CBP/p300 (p300 is the auxiliary activator required for
P53-dependent
Waf1/Cip1
transcription
activation)
is
a
transcriptional co-activator protein, which can interact with
P53 to regulate the early cell cycle and trigger apoptosis of
genetically intoxicated cells. So as to prevent the further
development of the tumor (Lee et al., 1998; Grossman et al.,
2003). After DNA damage, P53 can also be protected from
degradation through the acetylation targeting on carboxyl
terminal. This acetylation is conducive to cell survival because
it promotes the expression of cell cycle stagnation target genes
controlled by P53, such as the cell cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A, also known as P21) (Knights et al.,
2006; Kruse and Gu, 2008). Moreover, there are K120 and
K164 in the binding domain of P53 DNA, which are the most
common mutation regions of P53 in solid malignant tumors. For
example, in glioblastoma, K164 has a mutation, indicating that
acetylation of P53 plays a signiﬁcant role in tumor inhibition
(Zhang et al., 2015; He et al., 2017).
4 Regulation target of P53
4.1 PUMA and P53
P53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) was
identiﬁed as a transcription target for P53 (Nakano and
Vousden, 2001). It is highly conservative between humans and
mice. The genetic structure of PUMA in mice and humans is also
similar (Han et al., 2001). This protein belongs to the BH3-Only
subgroup of Bcl-2 protein family. The BH3 domain of PUMA is
necessary for its interaction with Bcl2-like proteins (Naik et al.,
2007). The BH3 domain of PUMA forms a bikinetic alpha-helical
structure, which binds directly to the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family
(Day et al., 2008). The C-terminal part of PUMA contains a
hydrophobic domain to guide its mitochondrial location.
BH3 domain and mitochondrial localization are essential for
PUMA’s ability to induce apoptosis or inhibit cell survival (Yu
and Zhang, 2008). PUMA is usually expressed at a low level, but
once stressed, its expression will be immediately induced (Yu
et al., 2001). Bioinformatic analysis revealed the gene promoters,
exons and introns of PUMA. In the transcription factors of
PUMA, P53 plays a signiﬁcant role, and its function is explored
most thoroughtly for now.
PUMA is a member of the Bcl-2 family that only relies on
BH3 (BH3). It is an important mediator of P53-dependent and

Bax and/or Bak. It directly binds and antagonizes all known
members of the Bcl2 family who are anti-apoptotic, thus
inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation.
Therefore, PUMA can be activated to inhibit tumor growth by
restoring the apoptosis of cancer cells (Yu and Zhang, 2008). In
this process, the promoter of PUMA binds to P53 to promote the
modiﬁcation of core histones. For example, as is mentioned
above about the post-translational acetylation, P53 acetylates
the core histones, leading to the opening and transcriptional
activation of the chromatin structure. After P53 activates PUMA,
it initiates cell apoptosis, thus preventing tumor cells from
growing (Kim et al., 2019). To sum up, after DNA damage
occurs, nuclear P53 will immediately induce PUMA production,
thus protmoting apoptosis.
Zhang et al. reported in their study that the role of miR-221/
222 in the regulation of apoptosis was conﬁrmed. MiR-221/
222 gene knockout (KO) can cause mitochondrial membrane
potential changes and caspase-mediated apoptosis. In addition,
they also proved that the apoptotic protein PUMA is negatively
regulated by miR-221/222 (Zhang et al., 2010). In glioblastoma,
experiments show that miR-221/222 regulates the mitochondrial
pathway by directly targeting PUMA to induce cell survival
(Zhang et al., 2010).
4.2 P21 and P53
Similar to PUMA, CDKN1A (P21) is also one of the downstream
factors regulated by P53. It is one of the important target genes for
P53 to induce cell cycle stagnation. Cdkn1a gene encodes P21W
AF1 protein. AF1 protein is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that
can directly interact and inhibit the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
complex, causing cell cycle stagnation (el-Deiry et al., 1993; Harper
et al., 1993). Through the action of CDK, P21 inhibits the
phosphorylation of Rb, and then Rb binds to E2F to prevent the
transcription required for the progression of the cell cycle. P21 can
interact with multiple CDK complexes expressed in the cell cycle,
resultingin the cell cycle stagnation in different phases. Speciﬁcally, the
interaction
between
P21
and
Cyclin
E/CDK2
and
Cyclin
D/CDK4 promotes the binding of Rb to E2F, leading to the cease
in G1 phase (Nakanishi et al., 1999; Stewart et al., 1999). On the other
hand, the binding of P21 to Cyclin B/CDK1 leads to G2/M cell cycle
stagnation (Dash and El-Deiry, 2005). Therefore, as a downstream
factor of P53, P21 can also participate in the regulation of the cell cycle.
5 P53 and gliomas
Tumors arising from glial cells (gliomas) make up the most
common group of primary brain tumors (Friedmann-Morvinski
et al., 2012). Despite the use of multiple therapies in combination
regarding surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, the
survival of patients with high grade or recurrent gliomas
remains
poor;
the
median
survival
of
patients
with
glioblastoma is less than a year (Phillips et al., 2006; Ma et al.,
2021). In the latest WHO glioma classiﬁcation, adult-type diffuse
gliomas
are
divided
into
the
following
categories:
1)
Astrocytoma,
IDH-mutant;
2)
Oligodendroglioma,
IDH-
mutant, and 1p/19q-codeleted; 3) Glioblastoma, IDH-wild
type (Louis et al., 2021). To improve therapeutic approaches
for patients with gliomas and to understand glioma biology
better, current research has focused on molecular and genetic
alterations associated with the development and progression of
gliomas (Ma et al., 2021).
The P53 gene, which resides on chromosome 17p13.1 and
encodes the P53 protein, is the most frequent target for mutations
in human cancers, with more than half of all tumors exhibiting a
mutation at this locus (Vogelstein et al., 2000; Freed-Pastor and
Prives, 2012). Loss of P53 transcriptional activity, mutations in
P53 gene or inhibition on P53 signaling, are major contributing
factors to malignant transformation (Jain and Barton, 2018).
P53 participates in many cellular functions including cell cycle
control, DNA repair, cell differentiation, genomic plasticity, and
programmed cell death (Hollstein et al., 1991; Harris, 1996b).
The prime function of wild type P53 is the ability to promote the
stagnation of the cell cycle and apoptosis (Kastenhuber and
Lowe, 2017). Therefore, the activation of P53 can prevent and
eliminate DNA-damaged cells to prevent the accumulation of
oncogene mutations to ward off cancer (Livingstone et al., 1992).
P53 also functions to modulate the downstream signaling
pathway or modify the translated protein to regulate the
apoptosis of tumor cells and cell cycle (Brady et al., 2011).
The glioma is the most common primary brain tumors in
neurosurgery, especially glioblastoma (GBM) which is with the
highest grade. It usually has a fully structured P53 gene.
Therefore, the proliferation of GBM and resistance to treatment
may be related to the loss of P53 function (Lou et al., 2020). In the
experiment, cyclic RNA CDR1as is widely expressed in the brain of
mammals, which can decrease with the increase of glioma grade and
can predict the total survival period of patients with glioma.
Moreover, CDR1as can bind to and stabilize P53 by preventing
ubiquitination. CDR1as interacts directly with the P53 DBD domain
necessary for MDM2 binding, thus undermining the formation of
the P53/MDM2 complex (Lou et al., 2020), preventing MDM2 from
negatively regulating P53. The study also proved that the enhanced
expression of CDR1as signiﬁcantly inhibits cell proliferation, while
the down-regulation of CDR1as promotes cloning (Lou et al., 2020).
Not only cyclic RNA CDR1as can inhibit cell proliferation by
changing the relationship between MDM2 and P53. In one
experiment, miRNA-129 inhibits glioma cell growth by targeting
CDK4, CDK6, and MDM2. The experimental results show that
over-expression of miR-129 can
reduce
the
expression of
CDK4 genes in HEK293 cells by 58.9% and CDK6 by 35.7%.
Frontiers in Genetics
frontiersin.org
05
Lei et al.
10.3389/fgene.2022.1051395
The expression of MDM2 has also been reduced by 49%. Therefore,
we can say that miR-129 signiﬁcantly targets and inhibits the
expression of CDK4, CDK6 and MDM2. Additionally, miR-129
also inhibits cell proliferation by affecting MDM2 (Moradimotlagh
et al., 2020).
In another experiment, it was also conﬁrmed that miR-29a can
raise the level of P53 and induce apoptosis dependent on
P53 function (Park et al., 2009). Chen et al. reported that miR-
29a negatively regulates the expression of MDM2 by directly
targeting MDM2 in glioma cells (Chen et al., 2021). As a
negative regulator of the P53 gene, over-expression of miR-29
can precisely inhibit MDM2. That is to say, it can enhance the
stable expression of P53, thus facilitating apoptosis and cell cycle
stagnation in tumor cells (Moradimotlagh et al., 2020). The various
MDM2 inhibitors mentioned above have shown inhibitory effects
on MDM2 and P53, laying the foundation for future treatment of
glioma and improvement of its prognosis. For example, the
MDM2 inhibitor RG7112, the ﬁrst one to be admitted to clinical
trials, although not yet extensively carried out, it provides a certain
basis for molecular targeted treatment of gliomas (Figure 2).
6 P53 and cerebral stroke
6.1 P53 and ischemic stroke
Ischemic stroke is the main cause of morbidity and death,
and the result depends on the extent on the number of neuronal
deaths. Cerebral ischemia and hypoxia activate P53 to provide
targets for the treatment of stroke (Arumugam et al., 2018).
Many studies have shown that P53 is an apoptosis-promoting
factor, which expresses an increase in cell apoptotic injury after
cerebral ischemia. In addition, in different stroke models, the loss
of P53 or the application of P53 inhibitors may potentially reduce
the volume of cerebral infarction (Hong et al., 2010). Not only
that, more and more experiments have shown that P53 is related
to the death of neurons in animal experimental models of
cerebral ischemia or hypoxia (Banasiak and Haddad, 1998;
Leker et al., 2004; Endo et al., 2006; Yonekura et al., 2006;
Damisah et al., 2020). P53-mediated apoptosis is a common
cell death mechanism that can be triggered by oxidative stress or
DNA damage (Amundson et al., 1998). It is activated in the
cerebral ischemia area and promotes the apoptosis of neurons.
The lack of P53 or the application of its inhibitors can
signiﬁcantly reduce brain damage. P53-mediated apoptosis of
nerve cells occurs through a variety of molecular mechanisms,
such as Notch signaling pathway (Hong et al., 2010; Arumugam
et al., 2018). Notch1 is a membrane receptor that regulates the
proliferation, differentiation and transition of cells in a series of
tissues (Lathia et al., 2008). In the developing brain, Notch signals
participate in the preservation of nerve precursor cells in an
unduplicated state, partly by inhibiting neurogenesis. Notch
signals also affect synaptic plasticity and learning memory in
the adult brain (Alberi et al., 2013; Sargin et al., 2013). As shown
in a study, active Notch inhibits the growth of B-cell, interrupts
the cell cycle, and induces apoptosis (Morimura et al., 2000). An

active form of Notch1 can raise the level of nuclear P53 to
promote the transcription of apoptosis genes (Yang et al., 2004).
Notch1 signaling pathways and four important interaction
pathways (NF-κB, P53, HIF-1α and PIN1) are aggregated on a
conservative
DNA-related
nucleopolyprotein
complex
that
control the expression of genes that determine the fate of
neurons. In mice experiments, mice with Notch inhibitors
showed
reduced
damage
to
brain
cells
and
improved
functional results. Therefore, inhibiting Notch may prevent
P53-mediated apoptosis and improve the activity of neurons
(Arumugam et al., 2018).
Similarly, in the model of simulating cerebral ischemia,
mouse focal cerebral ischemia, global cerebral ischemia (GCI)
and transient frontal-temporal ischemia, it is found that the
mRNA and protein of P53 in the ischemic area are elevated
(van Lookeren Campagne and Gill, 1998; Watanabe et al.,
1999; Hong et al., 2010). Research also shows that not only
does the expression of P53 increase in ischemic areas, but also
in astrocytes and neuron cells (Banasiak and Haddad, 1998).
In ischemic stroke, the damage of cerebral endothelial cells is
caused by ischemia. In order to prove the role of activated
protein C (APC) in stroke, a hypoxic cerebral endothelial cell
(CEC) injury model is constructed (Cheng et al., 2003). APC is
a systemic anticoagulant and anti-inﬂammatory factor which
can reduce organ damage. Experiments show that APC
directly
prevents
the
apoptosis
of
hypoxic
human
endothelial cells by suppressing P53 at transcriptional level,
normalizing the Bax/Bcl2 ratio that promotes apoptosis and
reducing the Caspase-3 signal transduction (Cheng et al.,
2003).
P53 can also regulate ischemic stroke through the P53/
PRAS40/mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway is involved in
a
variety
of
physiological
processes,
including
cell
metabolism, growth, differentiation, development and cell
survival (Liu and Sabatini, 2020). In addition, it is also
involved in the protection of cerebral ischemia (Xie et al.,
2018). In previous studies, it has been proven that the
activation of mTOR can reduce stroke-related neurons
(Xie et al., 2014). In the P53/PRAS40/mTOR pathway, one
of the important components of the mTOR complex is the
proline-rich
Akt
and
substrate
PRAS40,
which
is
at
downstream
of
Akt,
and
the
phosphorylated
PRAS40
(pPRAS40) can activate the mTOR pathway (Kovacina
et al., 2003; Wiza et al., 2014). Previous studies have
reported
the
negative
feedback
relationship
between
P53 and PRAS40, indicating that P53 can be inhibited by
its downstream factor PRAS40. Therefore, it can connect
P53 with PRAS40 and mTOR and play an important role
in ischemic stroke (Xiong et al., 2014). The brain damage of
mice with gene PRAS40 knockout is more serious than
normal mice after ischemic stroke. The over-expression of
pPRAS40
can
reduce
brain
ischemia/reperfusion
(I/R)
damage and autophagy by activating mTOR. Not only that,
studies have suggested that there is a negative feedback
relationship between P53 and PRAS40, and P53 can be
inhibited by its downstream factor PRAS40 (Havel et al.,
2015; Zhao et al., 2021). In three groups of mice experiments:
P53 KO mice (P53−/−), heterozygous (P53+/−) mice, and WT
mice (P53+/+), the results showed that both P53 KO and
heterozygous groups had an improved neurological function
and reduced area of cerebral infarction, and P53 KO group
showed a better protective effect (Havel et al., 2015). This
study indicates that I/R damage to neurons in vivo and
in vitro can be reduced by inhibiting the P53/PRAS40/
mTOR pathway (Figure 3).
6.2 P53 and hemorrhagic stroke
P53
can
regulate
hemorrhagic
stroke
by
indirectly
regulating
ferroptosis.
Ferroptosis
is
a
non-apoptotic
programed cell death which has been discovered in recent
years (Zhang et al., 2021). Being different from apoptosis,
ferroptosis is triggered by iron overload intracellularly, and
characterized by speciﬁc pathological changes such as unique
mitochondrial
shrinking
under
transmission
electronic
microscope (TEM) (Alim et al., 2019). It has been noted
that
P53
has
a
strong
relationship
with
ferroptosis
especially in cerebral stroke (Jiang et al., 2015).
In ferroptosis, the three most important components are
lipids, iron and ROS. Metabolic disorder of one of the three may
lead to ferroptosis. P53 participates in the metabolic regulation of
the three, therefore we have good rationale to infer that P53 can
regulate ferroptosis (Liu and Gu, 2021).
Ferroptosis can be driven by fatal lipid peroxidation,
which
may
be
caused
by
cell
metabolism
and
redox
imbalances (Jiang et al., 2021). In 1950s, studies showed
that
cysteine
deﬁciency
may
cause
cell
death,
and
endogenously synthesized cysteine may resist cell death
(Coltorti et al., 1956; Eagle et al., 1961). Cysteine is a speed
limiting factor in synthesis of glutathione (GSH), which can
pass through neutral amino acid transporter or oxidized by
cysteine/glutamate reverse transporter (a transmembrane
protein
complex
containing
SLC7A11
and
SLC3A2 subunits, known as system xc−) (Bannai and
Kitamura,
1980;
Sato
et
al.,
1999)
to
absorbed
in
environment or synthesized using the sulfurization pathway
of methionine and glucose (Meister, 1995). GSH is a cofactor
of many enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase (GPX4)
and glutathione-S-transferase (Meister, 1995).
It has been reported that GSH and GPX4 can protect cells
from various oxidative stress (Liu and Gu, 2021). GPX4 is a
selenium protein that can reduce oxidized lipids. In the
experiment from Conrad et al., the mouse model that
knocked out the gene Gpx4 showed that the deletion of the
Gpx4 gene would lead to the death of non-apoptotic cells

realted to lipid peroxidation in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts
(Seiler
et
al.,
2008).
Therefore,
inhibiting
the
lipid
peroxidation of cells can reduce ferroptosis.
A study in 2015 demonstrated that P53 can promote
ferroptosis by inhibiting the ability of cysteine to enter
target cells (Jiang et al., 2015). In terms of mechanism,
P53 can prevent cysteine from further generating GSH by
inhibiting the transcription of subunit SLC7A11 of the
cysteine/glutamate reverse transporter core. GSH is an
antioxidant
utilized
by
GPX4
to
inhibit
ferroptosis.
Therefore, the inhibition of SLC7A11 by P53 can reduce
intracellular GSH levels and promote cell ferroptosis (Yang
et al., 2014).
It is well know that after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH),
one of the mechanisms causing brain cell death is via
ferroptosis
(Karuppagounder
et
al.,
2016).
Once
ICH
occurs, an increase in lipid peroxidation can be observed in
neuronal cells (Karuppagounder et al., 2018). In mice
experiments, the level of GPX4 in neurons is selectively
manipulated to verify whether improving GPX4 has a
protective effect on neurons after ICH. The results show
that in the ﬁrst 2 weeks of ICH, increased expression of
GPX4 can reduce apoptosis, and have a protective effect on
neurons (Alim et al., 2019).
To sum up, P53 may indirectly regulate the prognosis of
intracranial hemorrhage by indirectly regulating ferroptosis,
which also provides a certain basis for the treatment of
hemorrhagic stroke (Figure 4).
7 P53 and neurodegenerative
diseases
7.1 P53 and Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related
neurodegenerative disease (Olivier et al., 2010). Its clinical
characteristics are progressive memory disorders, personality and
behavioral changes (Qi et al., 2019). Its pathology is characterized by
three main histological lesions, the senile plaques, the neuroﬁbrillary
tangles and atrophy of cerebral cortex. While senile plaques are
extracellular deposits mainly due to the aggregation of a set of various
hydrophobic peptides under the term of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides
(Checler and Alves da Costa, 2014). Aβ protein may cause
neurotoxicity via inﬂammatory responses, especially small and
soluble Aβ oligomers. The main pathological characteristics of AD
are diffuse atrophy of the cerebral cortex and massive synaptic loss
and excessive phosphorylated tau protein aggregates in cells (Qi et al.,
2019),
which
is
considered
to
be
associated
with
many
neurodegenerative diseases, and changes in tau protein are
believed to be the result of downstream Aβ protein toxicity in the
amylosis hypothesis (Dickson et al., 2013).
Due to the lack of timely access to anatomical tissue and various
technical limitations, the death of nerve cells from apoptosis has
always been controversial, but there is also some evidence that cell
death in the brain of AD patients occurs to some extent through
apoptosis (Kusiak et al., 1996). Some observations show that the
decomposition and metabolism derived from β-Amyloid precursor
FIGURE 4
Inhibition of P53 on ferroptosis after hemorrhagic stroke and this may provide new insight in the treatment of cerebral stroke in the future.

protein (β-APP) can indeed trigger apoptosis in cell and animal
models (Matsui et al., 2006). β-APP-derived fragments can also
adjust P53. In order to identify P53 as a marker of AD, the
experiment compared the impact of AD on the brain and the
P53-like immune response in the control group. Through
measurement, it was found that the expression of P53 was
signiﬁcantly enhanced, not only in glial cells, but also in many
neuronal cells. This shows that P53 may lead to cell death in the AD
brain (Ohyagi et al., 2005). Parallel increase in P53 and cell death can
be observed in AD-affected brains to suggest that P53 plays a role in
cell cycle stagnation, DNA repair and apoptosis (Bourdon et al.,
2003; Aylon and Oren, 2011). Therefore, enhancing the expression
of P53 may be the cause of an increase in cell death observed in the
AD brain. P53 can also control the expression of proteins involved in
AD pathology, indirectly affecting the course of the disease, rather
than the classical target proteins.
P53 is also an important regulator for the expression of
miRNAs. Some miRNAs, especially miRNAs from the miR-
34 family, have been identiﬁed as direct transcription targets
for P53. The expression of P53 horizontally induces the
expression of miR-34 after transcription by binding to the
DROSHA complex (Rokavec et al., 2014). In particular, miR-
34a has the highest expression in the brain. As was reported,
miR-34a could regulate the differentiation of neurons and
the growth of axons. In the brain tissue of AD patients, it was
found that its expression was up-regulated. John R. Dickson’s
study found that changes in the expression of miR-34a can
regulate the expression of tau in the pathogenesis of AD. The
possible mechanism is that when the protein of tau
aggregates, the up-regulation of miR-34a may be used as a
compensation mechanism to reduce the expression of tua.
This maight offer the opportunity to improve the prognosis
of AD patients (Dickson et al., 2013). The miR-34a also
regulates the expression of several synaptic proteins in
cortical
neurons
(Jazvinšćak
Jembrek
et
al.,
2018).
Oxidative stress is one of the conditions under which AD
occurs. Under the condition of oxidative stress, P53 will react
(Jazvinšćak Jembrek et al., 2018). Generally speaking, in mild
oxidative damage, P53 can antioxidate to promote cell
survival, while in severe oxidative stress, P53 can promote
oxidative activity and lead to cell death (Jazvinšćak Jembrek
et al., 2018). In human AD, the increase in the expression of
P53 is directly proportional to the accumulation of Aβ
protein in cells. Oxidative stress is closely related to
mitochondrial
dysfunction,
and
P53
can
protect
mitochondrial function by promoting the production of
new mitochondria (Jazvinšćak Jembrek et al., 2018).
7.2 P53 and Parkinson’s disease
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a motor-related disease
characterized by the loss of dopamine energy neurons in
the dense part of the grey matter (Pariyar et al., 2017).
Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are the
main
pathological
motivations
of
PD.
Slow
motion,
stiffness,
tremor
and
abnormal
posture
are
clinical
manifestations (Talebi et al., 2021). The treatment of PD
is drug therapy and surgical operation, mainly for symptoms.
In autopsy studies, the expression of P53 and its target gene
Bax in the tissues of PD patients increased (Qi et al., 2016).
Recent
literature
shows
that
P53
is
involved
in
the
occurrence
of
familial
PD
through
Parkin-mediated
transcription
regulation.
Experiments
show
that
the
toxicity of α-synaptic nucleoprotein associated with P53 is
shown in the PD model in vitro and in vivo (Duplan et al.,
2016). P53 is also involved in the regulation of DJ-1, Park7’s
mRNA and protein expression. P53 is a feasible missing link
between hereditary and sporadic PD (Venderova and Park,
2012).
Parkin is a ubiquitin E3 ligase, a transcription inhibitor of
P53. Exogenous Parkin gene deletion leads to increased
P53 gene expression (da Costa et al., 2009). Phorbol-12-
myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1 (PMAIP1/NOXA)
balances the P53-dependent apoptosis associated
with
mitochondrial injures (Talebi et al., 2021). P53 can bind
to Bcl2 to induce apoptosis by releasing Bcl2-associated
protein X/Bcl2 homologous antagonist (Bax/Bak) from
MPTP (Mattson and Magnus, 2006). The over-expression
of P53 weakens the calcium ion transfer of mitochondria and
provocates mitochondrial disturbance (Moon and Paek,
2015). Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by
excessive expression of P53 is an important factor in PD
progression. Moreover, the interaction of P53/Bclxl destroys
the mitochondrial membrane potential and participates in
the pathogenesis of PD.
8 Discussion and perspective
As a classic oncogene, P53 has guiding signiﬁcance in
tumor treatment and CNS diseases. In molecular biology, it
provides a theoretical basis for treatment. For example, in
glioblastoma,
surgical
operation
plus
radiotherapy
and
chemotherapy
do
not signiﬁcantly improve the 5-year
survival rate; the regulation of tumor cell death by P53 can
be used as a potential strategy to improve the outcome of
glioblastoma. Research on P53 has not been interrupted, and it
has also been found that more and more molecules are
regulated or controlled by P53, and vice versa. This has laid
a solid foundation for the future development of drugs and
molecular targeted treatment. However, there are relatively
few studies of P53 in cerebral ischemic and hemorrhage
stroke, particularly hemorrhagic stroke. After hemorrhagic
stroke, how to reduce the apoptosis of neurons and glial cells
through the regulation of P53 is an important subject in the

future. Regulation of the expression of P53 to treat cerebral
hemorrhagic stroke may become a potential hotspot.
