Abstract: In order to explore the secondary bond anchorage performance between prestressed
tendons and concrete after the fracture of steel strands in post-tensioned, prestressed concrete (PPC)
beams, a total of seven post-tensioned, prestressed concrete specimens with a size of 3 × 7φ15.2 mm
were constructed ﬁrstly, and the steel strands at the anchorage end were subjected to corrosion
fracture. Then, the pull-out test of the specimens was conducted to explore the secondary anchorage
bond mechanism of the residual stress of prestressed tendons experiencing local fracture. Moreover,
the inﬂuences of factors such as the embedded length, release-tensioning speed, concrete strength, and
stirrup conﬁguration on anchorage bond performance were analyzed. Finally, the test results were
further veriﬁed via ﬁnite element analysis. The results show that the failure of pull-out specimens
under different parameters can be divided into two types: bond anchorage failure induced by the
entire pull-out of steel strands and material failure triggered by the rupture of steel strands. The bond
anchorage failure mechanism between steel strands and the concrete was revealed by combining
the failure characteristics and pull-out load–slippage relation curves. The bond strength between
prestressed steel strands and concrete can be enhanced by increasing the embedded length of steel
strands, elevating the concrete strength grade, and enlarging the diameter of stirrups so that the
specimens are turned from bond anchorage failure into material failure.

1. Introduction
The concept of stress transfer and anchorage, which derives from pre-tensioned
specimens, refers to the process of stress increases in prestressed tendons at the beam
end from zero to the effective stress and ultimate stress [1]. The pre-tensioned specimens
complete the prestress transfer and anchorage through the bonding between prestressed
tendons and concrete, and the successful bonding between them is the basis for the normal
service of pre-tensioned members. Therefore, it is necessary to study bond anchorage
performance between steel strands and the concrete of pre-tensioned concrete members.
The relevant research results can also provide a scientiﬁc basis for the safety assessment
and maintenance decision-making processes of bridges in the future [2–4].
It is generally believed that the bonding force between steel strands and concrete
is composed of adhesion, mechanical interlock, and friction [5]. The bond anchorage
performance of steel strands is similar to that of plain steel bars in the early loading stage,
i.e., the bonding force is mainly provided by adhesion. In the later loading stage, mechanical
interlock plays a dominant role since the twisting process is adopted for steel strands, and
slippage is accompanied by the rotation along the twisting direction [6–8]. The bond

performance between steel strands and concrete is correlated with concrete strength, the
thickness of the concrete cover, the stirrup ratio, and the shape of prestressed tendons [9–11].
In some studies, bond stress–slippage models have been proposed through experimentation
and theoretical analysis. As a result, the nonuniform distribution characteristics of bond
stress along the embedded length have been determined [12,13]. With an increase in
concrete compressive strength, the average bond stress increases while the anchorage
length decreases [14,15]. Because stirrups can conﬁne the development of splitting cracks,
the slip amount is greater when anchorage fails. In other words, with an increase in the
stirrup ratio, both the bond strength and ultimate slip amount increase. To avoid the failure
of the structure due to anchorage failure, many national codes have given calculation
formulas for the anchorage length of ﬂexural specimens [1,16,17]. However, the existing
research results show that the calculation of the anchorage length given in the codes is
partially conservative and safe [9,18,19].
For bonded post-tensioned, prestressed concrete (PPC) members, the prestress is
transferred through the anchorage in the prestress application stage, and the anchorage
bonding is completed through the bonding between prestressed tendons and concrete in the
working stage [20]. Due to construction defects, however, PPC specimens may experience
insufﬁcient grouting, so that the structure develops from fully bonded prestressed concrete
to partially bonded prestressed concrete or even unbonded prestressed concrete. The
structure can still work normally without any bond failure thanks to the end anchorage.
In practical construction, due to construction defects such as the untimely closure of the
anchorage end or cavities in the concrete at the anchor sealing position, corrosion occurs in
the end anchorage zone with the extension of the service time, which leads to anchorage
failure [21–23]. It is considered that, after the anchorage failure of the PC specimens,
which is similar to pre-tensioned specimens, the residual prestress can be transferred and
anchored for the second time through the bond with concrete [24,25]. Its mechanism is
similar to that of pre-tensioned tendons but there are also differences. On the one hand, the
prestressed tendons of post-tensioned specimens are mostly placed in the specimens in the
form of multiple steel strands and the prestressed tendons interact with each other [26]; on
the other hand, the corrosion process of prestressed tendons is slow, which is different from
the rapid release-tensioning of pre-tensioned tendons. Rapid release-tensioning increases
the initial damage of concrete and reduces the bond stiffness, which affects the secondary
anchorage bond performance of the residual stress.
The secondary transfer and anchorage of residual stress after the stress fracture of
prestressed tendons have been preliminarily studied [25]. In this study, the ﬂexural perfor-
mance of the specimens after the local fracture of a single steel strand was explored. The
results show that the ﬂexural bearing capacity of the specimens experiencing end anchorage
failure only declined by 7.2% [24]. The calculation method for the bonding length of a single
steel strand after end fracture was obtained by setting ribbed pre-embedded pipelines.
However, corrugated pipes are usually used in practical projects, which is obviously not
consistent with a real-world situation [25]. At present, the bond performance of tendons
and concrete after the anchorage failure at the end of post-tensioned specimens has not
been systematically investigated.
Therefore, bond performance between the steel strands and concrete after the end
anchorage failure of the 3 × 7φ15.2 mm post-tensioned, prestressed concrete specimens is
studied, and the bond mechanism and bond failure mode are discussed through pull-out
tests and simulation analysis. Then, the key parameters inﬂuencing bond performance
are captured. Finally, a ﬁnite element modeling method is proposed, and its rationality is
veriﬁed based on experimental results.
2. Test Introduction
2.1. Specimen Design
In this experiment, a total of seven post-tensioned PC specimens were designed and
manufactured, numbered S1–S7 in turn. Considering that the web width at the end of a
Materials 2023, 16, 7441

small box girder is usually about 300 mm, the specimen width was also set to this value
in this experiment. The specimen height was determined by considering both the height–
width ratio and experimental economy. The cross-sectional dimensions of all pull-out
specimens were identical, being 300 mm × 500 mm. In addition, for the actual prestressed
concrete box girder, the concrete strength grades are usually C40 and C50, and the concrete
strength grade of some structures also reaches C60. As a result, the effect of these three
strength levels on the test results is also considered. Similarly, three commonly used
stirrup diameters of 8, 10, and 12 mm are used for the comparative analysis. Moreover, the
anchorage length of prestressed tendons that were estimated according to the speciﬁcation
of GB50010-2020 [16] should be less than 1300 mm, and only two types of specimens with
lengths of 1000 mm and 1250 mm are designed here. See Table 1 for the detailed dimensions
of the specimens.

A corrugated pipe with a diameter of 60 mm was reserved in the center of each speci-
men, seven-wire, twisted-steel strands (3 × 7φ15.2 mm) were designed in the corrugated
pipe, and eight Φ12 mm HRB400 deformed steel bars were longitudinally arranged outside
the corrugated pipe; stirrups were arranged around the longitudinal reinforcement at a
spacing of 100 mm. In order to study the inﬂuences of specimen length, concrete strength,
and stirrup ratio on the stress transfer and anchorage performance of fractured prestressed
tendons, two bond length values (1000 and 1250 mm), three concrete strength grades
(C40, C50, and C60), and three stirrup conﬁgurations (Φ8@100 mm, Φ10@100 mm, and
Φ12@100 mm) were designed for the test specimens. The stirrups were HPB300 plain steel
bars. The reinforcement layout of each specimen is displayed in Figure 1.
The tension control stress of steel strands is 1395 MPa, and the measured yield strength
is 1810 MPa. The material properties of steel strands and ordinary steel bars are listed
in Table 2. The concrete was composed of 42.5# ordinary Portland cement, natural river
sand, graded aggregate, and laboratory tap water mixed together. The tap water in the
laboratory was used as mixing water. Commercial cement mortar with the same grade
as concrete was used as grout. Standard cubic blocks were cast using the same batch
of concrete and maintained together with the test specimens. The average compressive
strength of the concrete of the C50, C40, and C60 specimens at 28 d was 53.5, 42.6, and
63.3 MPa, respectively.

sensor, and, meanwhile, the elongation of the steel strands was recorded using a dial in-
dicator. At 48 h after tensioning, the reading of the pressure sensor was obtained, and the 
eﬀective prestress applied by the member was measured, as seen in Table 3.

2.3. Stress Release of Anchorage Parts at the End of Prestressed Tendons
After grouting and maintaining for 28 d, the anchorage zone at the ends of S1–S5 was
locally corroded, and the corrosion mode was indoor electrochemical rapid corrosion. In
this experiment, a local corrosion tank with a length of 20 cm was designed and ﬁxed in the
end area of concrete specimens using structural adhesive, and the tank was ﬁlled with 5%
NaCl solution and installed with stainless-steel plates. During corrosion, the anode wire of
the constant DC power source was turned on and connected to the steel strand, and the
cathode wire of the power source was connected to the stainless-steel plate placed in the
corrosion tank. At the same time, a current loop could be formed by pouring NaCl solution
into the tank. Under the action of current, the anodic steel strand was corroded, as shown
in Figure 2. During the test, only the corrosion at the end of the steel strand was considered.
To avoid the inﬂuence of corrosion on ordinary steel bars, anti-corrosion treatment was
performed by smearing epoxy resin when binding the ordinary reinforcement cage. The
whole test was carried out in an environment with a temperature of 20 ◦C and humidity of

When specimen S3 was tensioned and anchored, a metal block was inserted between 
the anchor cup at one end and the specimen. After 48 h from completing the tensioning, 
the metal block was removed to achieve direct release tensioning.

2.4. Pull-Out Test Design of Steel Strands and the Test Devices
To discuss the secondary anchorage test, the pull-out test was implemented on the
uncorroded side after the corrosion fracture of the steel strands on one side of the member.
For this purpose, connectors, pull rods, and anchorage devices were specially designed,
as displayed in Figure 4. According to the rules of the concrete and steel strand grip test
provided in the Testing Code of Concrete for Port and Waterway Engineering (JTS/T 236-
2019) [27], the pull-out test device was self-designed. After completion, the test specimens
were tensioned using a hydraulic jack with a range of 100 t, and the pull-out force was
recorded with a pressure sensor.

Figure 4. Pull-out test device. 
The steel strands were pre-tensioned before the formal pull-out test to eliminate the 
nonelastic deformation between test devices, and the pre-tensioning force was set to 5 kN. 
After pre-tensioning, the readings of the anchorage dynamometer and dial indicator were 
reset at the loading end, and the formal loading procedure was started. The load was con-
trolled as per the load staging: initially, a 5 kN load was applied at each stage and 15 kN 
was applied at each stage after reaching 15 kN. Meanwhile, various test phenomena such 
as the displacement at the loading end and drawing end of the members, the readings of 
the anchorage dynamometer and suspension-type strain gauge, crack development, and 
the test sound under various loads were recorded. The pull-out test would be stopped 
immediately under any of the following circumstances during the test process: (1) the steel 
strand was pulled out or experienced fracture failure; (2) the slip amount at the loading 
end exceeded 30 mm, the load could not be continuously increased or the increment was 
very small, and the bond–slip failed. 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1. Failure Mode 
In this test, typical failure modes were observed in two categories: the ﬁrst involved 
the steel strands, which were pulled out as a whole, resulting in bond–slip failure. How-
ever, it diﬀered slightly from the individual strand slip process, in which three steel 
strands along with the concrete between them were entirely pulled out. The second cate-
gory involved the fracture of steel strands resulting in material failure, as depicted in Fig-
ure 5. Specimens S1, S3, and S4 experienced bond slip failure, while specimens S5 to S7 
exhibited material failure, as indicated in Table 4.

3.2. Crack Distribution
Different test specimens exhibit varying crack distributions, which can be classiﬁed
into three types based on the pattern of cracks. For the ﬁrst type, splitting cracks occurred
in specimens S1, S3, and S4. As the pull-out load continued to increase, a new crack along
the direction of the steel strands started appearing at the tensioning end. When the load
further increased to about 50% of the ultimate load, the initial tensile crack width started
increasing from the pull-out end to the free end, and several secondary splitting cracks
along the length direction appeared beside the splitting cracks; moreover, the free end
started slipping. As the load increased near the ultimate load, the main and secondary
splitting cracks both ran through the whole specimen, accompanied by a very loud splitting
sound. Subsequently, the steel strands were pulled out when the load reached the ultimate
value, as shown in Figure 6.

3.2. Crack Distribution 
Diﬀerent test specimens exhibit varying crack distributions, which can be classiﬁed 
into three types based on the pattern of cracks. For the ﬁrst type, splitting cracks occurred 
in specimens S1, S3, and S4. As the pull-out load continued to increase, a new crack along 
the direction of the steel strands started appearing at the tensioning end. When the load 
further increased to about 50% of the ultimate load, the initial tensile crack width started 
increasing from the pull-out end to the free end, and several secondary splitting cracks 
along the length direction appeared beside the splitting cracks; moreover, the free end 
started slipping. As the load increased near the ultimate load, the main and secondary 
splitting cracks both ran through the whole specimen, accompanied by a very loud split-
ting sound. Subsequently, the steel strands were pulled out when the load reached the 
ultimate value, as shown in Figure 6.

(b) shape of the main splitting crack at the corrosion end.
For the second type, longitudinal initial cracks appeared after the initial tensioning of
S5 was completed. During the test, the width of the initial tensile cracks increased subtly
with the increase in the pull-out load; moreover, the pull-out force reached about 60% of
the ultimate pull-out force, several longitudinal cracks were added (but only one splitting
crack appeared when the ultimate load was reached), and all cracks did not completely run
through the whole specimen. As shown in Figure 7, the load reached the limiting value,
and a loud sound was heard; moreover, the steel strands were ruptured, leading to material
failure that was accompanied by the rotation of the jack, which might be associated with
the twists that formed in the steel strands.
The third type of cracks occurred in S6 and S7. No secondary splitting cracks were
found in such specimens during the whole test process. Compared with type II specimens,
there were more longitudinal cracks; however, the length was smaller. A loud sound was
heard when the load reached the limiting value: the steel strands were ruptured, and
material failure occurred, as shown in Figure 8.

with the increase in the pull-out load; moreover, the pull-out force reached about 60% of 
the ultimate pull-out force, several longitudinal cracks were added (but only one splitting

run through the whole specimen. As shown in Figure 7, the load reached the limiting 
value, and a loud sound was heard; moreover, the steel strands were ruptured, leading to 
material failure that was accompanied by the rotation of the jack, which might be associ-
ated with the twists that formed in the steel strands.

terial failure occurred, as shown in Figure 8.

3.3. Load Bond–Slip Curves 
The load bond–slip curves between the loading end and the free end of specimens 
S1–S7 under the pull-out force are exhibited in Figure 9. For the same specimen, the load-
ing end slipped earlier than the free end, and the growth rate and limiting value of the 
slip amount were both greater than those at the free end. This was because, during the 
stress transfer of the pull-out force inside the specimen, stress loss would occur, and the 
pull-out force borne at the free end was much smaller than that at the pull-out end. 
It could be known from the load bond–slip curves on the loading side that the sec-
ondary anchorage failure process of the steel strands could be divided into three stages. 
The ﬁrst was the linear stage: when the tensile force was less than about 30% of the ulti-
mate pull-out load, the slip amount at the loading end was basically linear with the pull-
out load, and the sliding friction between steel strands and concrete played a major role; 
the second was the yield stage: when the pull-out load continued to increase to about 90% 
of the ultimate pull-out load, the slip growth of the pull-out end was obviously acceler-
ated, and the radial component of the mechanical bite force between the steel strands and

material failure that was accompanied by the rotation of the jack, which might be associ-
ated with the twists that formed in the steel strands.

The load bond–slip curves between the loading end and the free end of specimens 
S1–S7 under the pull-out force are exhibited in Figure 9. For the same specimen, the load-
ing end slipped earlier than the free end, and the growth rate and limiting value of the 
slip amount were both greater than those at the free end. This was because, during the

The load bond–slip curves between the loading end and the free end of specimens
S1–S7 under the pull-out force are exhibited in Figure 9. For the same specimen, the loading
end slipped earlier than the free end, and the growth rate and limiting value of the slip
amount were both greater than those at the free end. This was because, during the stress
transfer of the pull-out force inside the specimen, stress loss would occur, and the pull-out
force borne at the free end was much smaller than that at the pull-out end.

the grouting body continued to increase with the increase in the slip amount. Meanwhile, 
the bonding force between the steel strand and the concrete was gradually destroyed, the 
free end began slipping, and the stress of the steel strands gradually increased, entering 
the yield stage; the third stage was the failure stage: the pull-out force increased slightly, 
and the slip value increased rapidly. The steel strands were in the post-yield stage, the 
pull-out force suddenly decreased and then increased again, and the pull-out force ﬂuc-
tuated in a certain range until the steel strands were ﬁnally broken. Relative to the type II 
specimens in which steel strands were broken, for the type I specimens experiencing the 
pull-out failure of steel strands, the ultimate slip value at the pull-out end exceeded 30 
mm upon failure, and the specimens failed to provide enough secondary anchorage 
strength.

3.4. Inﬂuencing Factors 
In order to study the inﬂuence of diﬀerent parameters on the bond anchorage perfor-
mance of specimens, Figure 10 shows the load slip curves at the loading end under the 
inﬂuence of diﬀerent specimen lengths, prestress release methods, concrete strength, and 
stirrup diameters. Figure 10a shows the pull-out test results of specimens with diﬀerent 
concrete strengths. Comparing the data in Figure 10 and Table 4, the ultimate pull-out 
force of specimen S1 was 747 kN, which was 10.3% lower than that of specimen S4 and 
5.8% higher than that of S5. Under the ultimate load, the relative displacement between 
the pull-out end and the free end was 16.1 mm for S1 and 16.5 mm for S4, which was 2.5% 
higher than that for S1. The relative displacement for S5 was 10.5 mm, which was 34.8% 
less than that for S1. It could be seen that concrete strength had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on 
the pull-out performance of the specimens. The higher the concrete strength, the greater 
the ultimate pull-out force. Moreover, compared with the slippage and pull-out as a 
whole, the slip value at the loading end upon the tensile failure of the steel strands was 
signiﬁcantly reduced, and the specimen stiﬀness was strengthened by high concrete ten-
sile strength. This was because, the higher the concrete strength, the more obvious the 
radial squeezing eﬀect on steel strands, increasing the circumferential tensile stress and 
delaying the appearance of both microcracks and splitting cracks in the specimen. There-
fore, both the bond strength and stiﬀness of specimens signiﬁcantly increased with the 
increase in concrete strength, and S1 and S4 developed from the ﬁrst type of failure mode 
into the second type and experienced suﬃcient secondary anchorage. 
Figure 10b shows the pull-out test results of specimens with diﬀerent lengths. Com-
pared with specimen S1, the length of S2 only increased by 250 mm. Comparing the data 
in Figure 10b and Table 4, the ultimate pull-out load of S2 increased by 5.8% compared 
with that of S1. The maximum slip amount of S2 was only 48.1% of that of S1. This is

It could be known from the load bond–slip curves on the loading side that the sec-
ondary anchorage failure process of the steel strands could be divided into three stages.
The ﬁrst was the linear stage: when the tensile force was less than about 30% of the ultimate
pull-out load, the slip amount at the loading end was basically linear with the pull-out
load, and the sliding friction between steel strands and concrete played a major role; the
second was the yield stage: when the pull-out load continued to increase to about 90% of
the ultimate pull-out load, the slip growth of the pull-out end was obviously accelerated,
and the radial component of the mechanical bite force between the steel strands and the
grouting body continued to increase with the increase in the slip amount. Meanwhile, the
bonding force between the steel strand and the concrete was gradually destroyed, the free
end began slipping, and the stress of the steel strands gradually increased, entering the
yield stage; the third stage was the failure stage: the pull-out force increased slightly, and
the slip value increased rapidly. The steel strands were in the post-yield stage, the pull-out
force suddenly decreased and then increased again, and the pull-out force ﬂuctuated in a
certain range until the steel strands were ﬁnally broken. Relative to the type II specimens in
which steel strands were broken, for the type I specimens experiencing the pull-out failure
of steel strands, the ultimate slip value at the pull-out end exceeded 30 mm upon failure,
and the specimens failed to provide enough secondary anchorage strength.
3.4. Inﬂuencing Factors
In order to study the inﬂuence of different parameters on the bond anchorage perfor-
mance of specimens, Figure 10 shows the load slip curves at the loading end under the
inﬂuence of different specimen lengths, prestress release methods, concrete strength, and
stirrup diameters. Figure 10a shows the pull-out test results of specimens with different
concrete strengths. Comparing the data in Figure 10 and Table 4, the ultimate pull-out
force of specimen S1 was 747 kN, which was 10.3% lower than that of specimen S4 and
5.8% higher than that of S5. Under the ultimate load, the relative displacement between
the pull-out end and the free end was 16.1 mm for S1 and 16.5 mm for S4, which was 2.5%
higher than that for S1. The relative displacement for S5 was 10.5 mm, which was 34.8%
Materials 2023, 16, 7441

less than that for S1. It could be seen that concrete strength had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
the pull-out performance of the specimens. The higher the concrete strength, the greater the
ultimate pull-out force. Moreover, compared with the slippage and pull-out as a whole, the
slip value at the loading end upon the tensile failure of the steel strands was signiﬁcantly
reduced, and the specimen stiffness was strengthened by high concrete tensile strength.
This was because, the higher the concrete strength, the more obvious the radial squeezing
effect on steel strands, increasing the circumferential tensile stress and delaying the appear-
ance of both microcracks and splitting cracks in the specimen. Therefore, both the bond
strength and stiffness of specimens signiﬁcantly increased with the increase in concrete
strength, and S1 and S4 developed from the ﬁrst type of failure mode into the second type
and experienced sufﬁcient secondary anchorage.

4. Numerical Simulation Analysis 
4.1. Modeling 
To further explore the secondary anchorage performance of residual prestress after 
the end anchorage failure of the post-tensioned, prestressed members, the ﬁnite element 
calculation model of damaged concrete specimens was established using Abaqus (version 
of Abaqus CAE2016). The structure was established by using a discrete model, and the 
reduced integral hexahedral element (C3D8R) was used to simulate concrete. The size of 
the concrete unit is 20 mm × 18.75 mm × 20 mm. 
In the modeling process, a constitutive concrete damage plasticity (CDP) model was 
adopted. Regarding the model parameter of the CDP model, the measured value of the 
cubic compressive strength of the concrete was used. The tensile strength, elastic modulus, 
and other parameters of concrete were calculated according to speciﬁcation GB50010-2020 
[16]. The values of other CDP model parameters are shown in Table 5. Additionally, both 
ordinary steel bars and prestressed steel bars were simulated using truss elements (T3D2), 
and a constitutive relation model of double-broken-line, equal-strength hardening was 
selected [28]. A total of 28,522 nodes and 25,723 elements were set in the model, and the

concrete strength on pull-out performance; (b) different specimen lengths; (c) different release-
tensioning speeds and modes; (d) different stirrup conﬁgurations.
Figure 10b shows the pull-out test results of specimens with different lengths. Com-
pared with specimen S1, the length of S2 only increased by 250 mm. Comparing the data
in Figure 10b and Table 4, the ultimate pull-out load of S2 increased by 5.8% compared
with that of S1. The maximum slip amount of S2 was only 48.1% of that of S1. This
is because, when the embedded length of the specimen was greater than the secondary
anchorage length, the effective bond length could be increased by increasing the specimen
length, the actual bond strength was smaller than the ultimate bond strength, and the
overlapping between the length inﬂuenced by the pull-out force and the transfer length of
residual prestress at the corrosion end was delayed, the development of splitting cracks
was also delayed, and, thus, specimen stiffness grew evidently. The ultimate bond force
provided by the specimen was directly proportional to the embedded length of steel strands.
Hence, when the embedded length of the steel strands was greater than the secondary
Materials 2023, 16, 7441
11 of 16
anchorage length, the failure mode in the pull-out test was transformed from the ﬁrst
type—slippage failure as a whole—into the second type—material failure induced by the
rupture of steel strands.
Figure 10c shows the test results of different release-tensioning methods. Both S1 and
S3 experienced pull-out slippage failure as a whole. Compared with S1, the ultimate pull-
out load of S3 was reduced by 10.3%, and both specimens were subjected to the slippage
failure of steel strands as a whole. In the initial loading stage, almost no differences were
found between S1 and S3. As the load increased, the stiffness of S3 gradually declined
because the specimen needed a greater secondary transfer length due to sudden release
tensioning, which led to a reduction in the effective bond length. Under the pull-out
force, the pull-out bond length of the specimen overlapped with the secondary transfer
length earlier; moreover, the concrete splitting cracks also developed earlier, and both the
structural stiffness and ultimate bond strength decreased.
Figure 10d shows the pull-out test results of specimens with different stirrup conﬁgu-
rations. As more stirrups were conﬁgured, both S6 and S7 experienced the tensile failure of
steel strands, indicating that the increase in the stirrup ratio facilitated sufﬁcient secondary
anchorage. Comparing the data in Figure 10d and Table 4 shows that, compared with S1,
the ultimate pull-out force of S6 increased by 3.3% while that of S7 grew by 9.5%. The
pull-out performance of the specimens was signiﬁcantly affected by concrete strength: the
higher the concrete strength, the greater the ultimate pull-out force. In comparison with S1,
S7 possessed a longer platform after the yielding of steel strands. This was because, with
the increase in the diameter of the stirrups, the horizontal restraining effect provided by
the stirrups was enhanced, which could effectively restrain and delay the development
of splitting cracks, prevent the splitting failure of specimens, increase the structural bond
strength, and enhance structural ductility. Comparing the load–slip curves of S1, S6, and S7,
however, the difference among the three specimens in the slope of the load–slip curves was
not evident in the initial loading stage, and the structural stiffness could not be signiﬁcantly
increased by increasing the stirrups. This was because the stirrup stress was relatively
small in this case; moreover, the average stress of concrete within the wrapping scope of
stirrups was small, and the horizontal restraining effect of stirrups was also weak, thus
exerting a limited effect when increasing the structural initial stiffness.

the end anchorage failure of the post-tensioned, prestressed members, the ﬁnite element

the overall structural model is displayed in Figure 11.

To consider the bond slip between the steel strand and concrete, two diﬀerent nodes 
are set at the same positions as the steel strand and concrete, which are connected using 
nonlinear spring elements (SPRING2), and the bond–slip constitutive model in [29] is 
transformed into a spring constitutive model. In addition, the anchor pad is connected 
using the tie-in interaction module, and the connection between ordinary steel bars and 
concrete is embedded. To be consistent with the constraints in the actual working condi-
tions, three boundary conditions, DX, DY, and DZ, are added to the constrained concrete 
element in the actual working conditions. By activating and passivating the boundary 
conditions, the constraint changes in the prestressed tension stage, corrosion stage, and 
drawing stage are simulated. 
The external loads that need to be applied during the simulation process mainly in-
clude prestress and tensile force. The prestressing force is applied using the cooling 
method, while the pull-out load is applied to steel strand nodes through the direct loading 
method. The external loads that need to be applied during the simulation process mainly 
include prestress and tensile force. The prestressing force is applied using the cooling 
method, while the pull-out load is applied to the steel strand nodes through the direct 
loading method. 
The static and general analysis steps were adopted as follows: In step 1, all structural 
elements were inactivated. In step 2, the concrete elements, anchor plates, steel strands, 
reinforcement cages, and boundary conditions beyond the grouting part were activated. 
In step 3, prestress was applied through the cooling method. In step 4, grouting elements 
were activated. In step 5, the steel strand elements and anchor plates at the fracture part 
were inactivated. In step 6, the anchor blocks on the pull-out load side were inactivated, 
and the pull-out load was applied to the steel strand nodes. 
4.2. Veriﬁcation of Calculation Results 
Because static and general analysis steps were adopted, only S1–S2 and S3–S7 were 
subjected to the ﬁnite element method. The calculated and measured values of the ulti-

Figure 11. Overall structural model: (a) step 4 model; (b) step 6 model.
To consider the bond slip between the steel strand and concrete, two different nodes
are set at the same positions as the steel strand and concrete, which are connected using
nonlinear spring elements (SPRING2), and the bond–slip constitutive model in [29] is
transformed into a spring constitutive model. In addition, the anchor pad is connected
using the tie-in interaction module, and the connection between ordinary steel bars and
concrete is embedded. To be consistent with the constraints in the actual working conditions,
three boundary conditions, DX, DY, and DZ, are added to the constrained concrete element
in the actual working conditions. By activating and passivating the boundary conditions,
the constraint changes in the prestressed tension stage, corrosion stage, and drawing stage
are simulated.
The external loads that need to be applied during the simulation process mainly
include prestress and tensile force. The prestressing force is applied using the cooling
method, while the pull-out load is applied to steel strand nodes through the direct loading
method. The external loads that need to be applied during the simulation process mainly
include prestress and tensile force. The prestressing force is applied using the cooling
method, while the pull-out load is applied to the steel strand nodes through the direct
loading method.
The static and general analysis steps were adopted as follows: In step 1, all structural
elements were inactivated. In step 2, the concrete elements, anchor plates, steel strands,
reinforcement cages, and boundary conditions beyond the grouting part were activated.
In step 3, prestress was applied through the cooling method. In step 4, grouting elements
were activated. In step 5, the steel strand elements and anchor plates at the fracture part
were inactivated. In step 6, the anchor blocks on the pull-out load side were inactivated,
and the pull-out load was applied to the steel strand nodes.
4.2. Veriﬁcation of Calculation Results
Because static and general analysis steps were adopted, only S1–S2 and S3–S7 were
subjected to the ﬁnite element method. The calculated and measured values of the ultimate
pull-out load for the specimens are listed in Table 6. It could be seen that the relative error
between the test value and the numerically calculated value of the ultimate pull-out load

calculated values relatively coincided with the test values.

See Figure 12 for the test value and numerically calculated value of the loading–end
slip value of different specimens under different pull-out loads. It could be observed
that the test value of the loading–end slip amount under different loads was relatively
consistent with the calculated value, further verifying the effectiveness of the calculation
model. Figure 12b needs to be adjusted to the following ﬁgure.

In order to compare the damage status of concrete under the same level of the pull-out
load and the secondary anchorage status of residual prestress in the specimens, the inﬂuence
of the embedded length of steel strands, concrete strength, and stirrup conﬁguration on
the secondary anchorage of residual prestress was analyzed theoretically. Referring to
the ultimate bearing capacity of each specimen, the pull-out load was 730 kN, and the
concrete damage and cracking induced by tensioning and the stress state of concrete in
each specimen are shown in Figure 13. It can be seen from Figure 13 that, when the stress of
the steel strands reached 1730 MPa, splitting cracks appeared in all specimens, and one to
four secondary splitting cracks were produced. Therein, the main splitting cracks already
ran through the whole S4 specimen. The increasing embedded length of the steel strands
could postpone the generation of the main splitting cracks; however, the effect was not
evident in the free-end secondary splitting cracks. Increasing the concrete strength and
the stirrup ratio could effectively constrain the generation of splitting cracks and enhance
the splitting stress and ultimate bond strength of specimens, which coincided with the test
results and further veriﬁed the effectiveness of the calculation model.

5. Conclusions 
(1) After the end anchorage failure of post-tensioned, prestressed specimens, the 
secondary anchorage bond performance of residual prestress is affected by factors 
such as the embedded length of steel strands, release-tensioning speed, concrete 
strength, and stirrup ratio. The increase in the embedded length of steel strands and 
the strength grade of concrete is beneficial for improving the bonding performance 
of the specimens; 
(2) The pull-out process of prestressed specimens can be divided into three stages: the 
linear stage, yield stage, and failure stage. After the maximum pull-out force is 
reached, the specimen experiences bond failure or fracture failure in the prestressed 
steel strands; 
(3) In this study, the construction condition considered is the corrosion fracture of end 
steel strands as a whole, which can be accompanied by corrosion damage along the 
full length of steel strands; however, this factor is not taken into account; 
(4)
The specimen sizes are evidently smaller than those in actual engineering structures

5. Conclusions
(1)
After the end anchorage failure of post-tensioned, prestressed specimens, the sec-
ondary anchorage bond performance of residual prestress is affected by factors such
as the embedded length of steel strands, release-tensioning speed, concrete strength,
and stirrup ratio. The increase in the embedded length of steel strands and the
strength grade of concrete is beneﬁcial for improving the bonding performance of
the specimens;
(2)
The pull-out process of prestressed specimens can be divided into three stages: the
linear stage, yield stage, and failure stage. After the maximum pull-out force is

reached, the specimen experiences bond failure or fracture failure in the prestressed
steel strands;
(3)
In this study, the construction condition considered is the corrosion fracture of end
steel strands as a whole, which can be accompanied by corrosion damage along the
full length of steel strands; however, this factor is not taken into account;
(4)
The specimen sizes are evidently smaller than those in actual engineering structures,
and the number of specimens is small. In addition, the secondary anchorage bond
performance of residual stress after the end corrosion fracture of steel strands in
practical engineering remains to be further investigated.
