INTRODUCTION 
The union of body, senses, mind and soul is called 
Ayu (life)1. A human being is a tripod having three 
pillars, Satva (mind), Atma (soul) and Sharira (body) 
2. Here, Satva is a connecting link between Atma and 
Sharira, which is otherwise called Manas. It has an 
immense influence on the health and ill health of the 
individual. ‘Prasanna’ Manah is a sign of healthy 
life3.  
In our classics, Chikitsa is classified into two parts 
based on resources (Vyapashraya Bheden): 1. Daiv-
vyapashray Chikitsa 2. Yuktivyapashrya Chikitsa. 
Daivvyapashray Chikitsa refers to Mantra, Ausadhi, 
Mani, Mangala, Bali, Upahara, Home, Niyam, 
Prayashchita, Upvasa, Swastyayanapatha, Pranipata, 
Gamana etc. Yuktivyapashrya Chikitsa refers to 
Samsodhana (Vamanadi) and Upshamana (Pachana-
di)4. In another context Acharya Charak explained 
Trividham Ausdham as; 1. Daivvyapashray Chikitsa, 
2. Yuktivyapashrya Chikitsa and 3. Satvavajaya 
Chikitsa. Their Satvavajaya Chikitsa further ex-
plained, "Aiming to control the mind or is a method 
of restraining the mind from unwholesome objects5.” 
The same thing is also well supported by Acharya 
Vagbhata6. Satvavajaya Chikitsa is that typical 
Ayurvedic approach that prevents the impaired Dhi, 
Dhriti and Smriti and brings them back to a normal 
state. Hence, it plays a significant role in maintain-
ing a harmonious state between these three factors, 
ultimately leading to a happy and healthy state of the 
individual. In our classics, Swasthya (Health) is de-
fined as an equilibrated state of Dosha (physiologi-
cal unit of body), Dhatus (anatomical unit of body), 
Mala (waste products), Agni (digestive fire), Shari-
rika Karma (normal physiological actions) and 
pleasure of Atma, Indriya and Mana7.  
 
General Causes of Manas Roga 
In general, Mansika Roga are caused by- 
1- Asatmendriyartha Samyoga-  
Asatmendriyartha Samyoga, means improper contact 
between Indriya and Artha like Atiyoga, Heenayoga 
and Mithyayoga8. 
2- Pragyapradha- 
There it is told that derangement in Dhi, Dhriti and 
Smriti will lead to the inauspicious deeds resulting 
into aggravation of Sharirika and Mansika Doshas9. 
Further it is told that those who are not following 
courtesy and good conduct, insulting to Guru, Devta 
and knowing doing Ahit Artha Sevana and indul-

gence into causes of Unmada, walking inappropriate 
time (like midnight, Durdina), Aadesh (like Samshan, 
Chaitya, Chatwara Sthana etc.), friendship with mean 
deed persons and not following the Sadvritta (good 
conduct) and the person who are having Irshya, Ab-
himana, Bhaya, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada, 
Bhrama, Nindita Karma. Summarizing all other Kar-
mas which are done by encapsulating Mana and Atma 
by Raja and Moha. These are collectively falls under 
Pragyapradhas10. 
Specific Causes of Manas Roga 
“Mansah Punah Ishtashyalabhat Labhat Cha An-
ishtsya Upjayte.” 
Getting the undesirable things and not getting the de-
sirable things will leads to the Mansika Roga11. It in-
cludes love failures, losing temperament etc. 
 Losing your temper 
 Love Failure etc. 
 
 
 
Satvavajaya Chikitsa 
Aims of Satvavajaya Chikitsa12 
1- To help individual to discriminate between 
thoughts and action. 
2- To help individual to discriminate between objec-
tive and imagined dangerous and to respond selec-
tively to each. 
3- To divert mind and make the person to involve 
with commitment in other or next activity. 
4- To initiate Bhakti or regard or strengthened his 
believes in Istadaivam. 
5- To take out phobic nucleus by making awareness 
of subject knowledge and true facts.  
Satvavajaya Chikitsa is defined as which is aimed to 
control mind or it’s a method of restraining mind 
from unwholesome objects.  
“Satvavajayah Punah Ahitebhyo Arthebhyo Mano 
Nigrah.13” 
“Satvavajayah Punarahitanmanonigrah.14” 
(Ahita- Something is unwholesome to the other 
means each Indriya has its own object that only it can 
perceive i.e., Gandha is the object of Ghranendriya.) 
Satva, which is considered as ubhayendriya has been 
referred to as having at least five Arthas. Therefore, it 
can be inferred that Artha can be either Indriyartha or 
Manoartha. 
Asatmendriyartha Samyoga is one of the principle 
causes of diseases. So, avoidance of Atiyoga, Hee-
nayoga and Mithyayoga of Chintya, Vicharya, Oo-
hya, Dhyeya, and Sankalpa should serve to cure the 
Manas Roga (psychological disorders). 
Manonigraha means control of mind. Self-control of 
mind is one of the most difficult of the tasks and war-
rants a perfect combination of desire determination 
and dedication. 
“Abhyasen Tu Kauntey Vairagyen Cha Gri-
hayate”15. Lord Krishna told that simply the mind 
can’t be separated from the objects, but the mortifica-
tion can be achieved by the regular practice. Accord-
ing to Acharya Vrinda- 
“Karat Karat Abhyas Ke Jadmati Hot Sujan, Ra-
sari Avat-Jata Te Sil Par Padat Nisana”  means 
Practice turns a fool into a wise as the running rope 
makes its mark on a stone tablet. Satvavajaya re-
quires physicians’ interference with patients’ mind. 
The other types of Manonigraha, which are physi-
cian’s interference with patients mind control. While 
describing the principles of treatment Charaka pre-

scribes the following methods of treatment of mental 
diseases16.  
1. Gyanam  
2. Vigyanam  
3. Dhairya  
4. Smriti  
5. Samadhi 
 
 In other reference, Charaka prescribes the following 
treatment for the mental diseases which resemble the 
above lines of treatment17. 
1. Trivarga Anveshana - Contemplation of the three 
objectives of life. 
2. Tadvidyaseva - Service of those who are well 
versed in the treatment of mental diseases. 
3. Atmajnana- Self- realization. 
4. Kula-Kala-Bala-Jnana -The knowledge about 
one’s own self, country, family, age, vitality and 
ability. 
 
Besides the above method of treatment, stress has 
been also laid on the avoidance of volitional trans-
gression, control of the senses, Smrti (recollection), 
and on Sadvrittas18 (observation of rules of good con-
duct), retention of Dharaniya Manasika Vega19 etc. 
Taking into the consideration of the nature of tech-
niques, we can put all these psychological methods 
into three broad groups20. 
1. Rational persuasion 
2. Methods based on the deeper understanding. 
3. Mental equanimity. 
1. RATIONAL PERSUASION 
 Dhairya, Sadvritta and controlling of certain mental 
urges (Dharaniya Vega) leading to social and mental 
health are the method of rational persuasion for the 
treatment of mental diseases and to prevent their oc-
currence. 
a. Dhairya: - Dhairya is generally used in the sense 
of patience. Chakrapani explained it as Anunnat-
ishchetasah means the depressed mood should be ele-
vated. Charaka describes that the fevers due to libido 
(Kama), grief (Shoka), and fear (Bhaya), which are 
known in Ayurved as Kamaja Jvara, Shokaja Jvara 
and Bhayaja Jvara, should be treated by consolation 
achievement, nerve depressants and merriments21. 
The modern psychotherapy is generally classified into 
(1) Supportive psychotherapy and (2) Interpretive 
psychotherapy. Supportive psychotherapy is in many 
respects similar to this Dhairya therapy. We include 
direct, simple and sympathetic advice and sheer reas-
surance and encouragement. By supporting therapy, 
we try to make the patient accept things without hos-
tility and distress, to explain to him the nature of his 
difficulties and to help and support him through the 
stresses which underlie these symptoms. The support-
ive therapy is the first line of defense against mental 
illness. It is conducted based on an interview. E.g., In 
most of Manasa Roga like Vishada, the Alpasattva is 
prime factor, so Dhairya should be given; it helps to 
lift up the Satva of patients.  
b. Sadvrita (good conduct):- In our classics good 
conduct is called Sadvrita which means leading a 
good life. The rules impose good health and conquest 
of the senses22 as well as one of the preventive 
measures for mental diseases23. A long list of the 
rules of good conduct has been prescribed in Charaka 
Samhita, out of which some of them are related to 
emotional and psychological aspects of life and most 
of them are more concerned with social and ethical 
aspects of life. Charaka has given more importance to 
the company of a person as it is the factor that ulti-
mately affects the way of life of a person, and the 
knowledge of authoritative instructions of Apta Puru-
sha and its right application and cure of the diseases. 
c. Dharaniya Vega:- 
The urges that are to be re-
strained are immensely related to mental hygiene and 
are called Dharaniya Vega. Charaka says that those 
who are desirous of their welfare both in this and the 
next world should restrain themselves from the rash 
and evil impulses of the mind24. The wise man should 
control the impulses of greed, grief, fear, anger, vani-
ty, impudence, jealously, excessive attachment and 
malice25. It should not be misunderstood in the sense 
of suppression, actually it is meant to overcome these 
fundamental emotional factors as otherwise if they 
cross the boundary of normalcy, they will be the bias 
of so many mental disorders. This concept of Dhara-
niya Vega is more of preventive nature and if proper-
ly followed, will lead to proper mental health.

2791 
d. Fear therapy: - These are fear tactics or psycho-
shock therapy. It is based on the ancient presumption 
that if a patient is shocked by fear to life, then he re-
gains his past memory. Charaka advises that the ter-
ror to the patient should be produced by the toothed 
snakes, tamed lions and elephants or by the robbers 
having fearful and dangerous arms or by enemies26.  
2. METHODS BASED ON THE DEEPER UNDER-
STANDING 
Under this head, we can include Jnanam, Vijnanam 
and Smriti. These are mentioned as methods of treat-
ment of mental diseases27. The term Jnanam, most 
probably used in the sense of Atma-Jnanam that is 
knowledge of self, Vijnanam is Shastra Jnanam that 
is the proper knowledge of Shastras and Smriti refers 
as Anubhutarth Jnanam. 
For attaining the Atma-Jnanam, Charaka has de-
scribed the various methods, but a great stress has 
been laid on true understanding (Satya Buddhi), that 
pure and true understating, which accrues to learning, 
attainment of judgment, genius, compression, and 
knowledge28. By this, he breaks the strong citadel of 
the darkness of the great illusion. By this, realizing 
the true nature of things, he becomes desire less, by 
this, he attains the true understanding, by this, he 
stands clear of egoism, by this, he gives up taking 
refuge in anything, by this he renounces all, by this he 
attains Brahma29. 
So, it is clear that attainment of self-realization 
through true and proper understanding has been re-
garded as a method of attaining ideal mental health 
and it can also be used in removing the mental disor-
ders by developing the true understating. With true 
understating the impure mind is cleaned, just as a 
looking glass is cleaned by being rubbed with such 
things as oil, cloth and brush. Prajnapradha has been 
regarded as one of the main causes of mental illness 
and, therefore, true understanding is very essential for 
the mental health. So, the path of self-realization and 
avoidance of Prajnaparadha has been regarded as a 
key to treating the mental illness and to achieving an 
ideal mental health30. 
This will act as preventive and curative aspect. Such 
as- 
Atma Gyana- who I am, what is beneficial to me.  
Desha Gyana – society, his responsibility towards it. 
Kula Gyana – Family and his relationship between 
them 
Kala Gyana – Season, Pathya, Apathya during this 
time 
Bala Gyana – Strength 
Shakti Gyana – Capacity 
For this instance, a mythological story is fit, i.e. In 
Arjuna Vishada Yoga of Bhagavat Geeta. In the bat-
tlefield by seeing his brother, elders, teachers, dear 
relatives31, Arjuna’s behavior was changed. For which 
Lord Krishna explains that we can’t kill anybody, the 
Atma (Linga Shareera) travels from one body to oth-
er32, it is just battle of Satya and Asatya etc. 
Another method based on the deeper understating for 
treating the patient by Smriti has been laid down in 
our classics. No details are found in the classics about 
the applied aspect of the method. The Smritinasha has 
been regarded as a mental disease in our classics. The 
cause of derangement of memory is of the mind being 
clouded with passion and delusion33.  
3. SAMADHI (MENTAL EQUANIMITY)  
It is a specialized subject of Yoga, mostly regarded 
either purely a spiritual science or a psychological 
technique to develop the ideal human personality, 
leading to the state of character transformation and 
attainment of final goal of life towards salvation. 
Charaka says that one who has a happy combination 
of his thought, speech and action, which has his mind 
under control, has his intellect clear and is devoted to 
austerities and Yoga never suffers from any disease34. 
So, it is clear that the control on mind and devotion to 
Yoga are very necessary even from the point of view 
of health. The stages of actual practice of Yoga (Sa-
madhi) have been described in Charaka Samhita in a 
very brief and concise manner at two places35. If we 
analyze the whole description of Yoga, we find that 
the following stages are being covered in Yoga.  
1. Abridging of Indriyas (Indriyani Samkshipya) - 
At first, we have to draw the Indriyas from the 
outer agencies (Arthas). 
2. Stilling the fickle mind (Chanchalam Maanah 
Samkshipya) - There after the full mind is made

2792 
still. It is the second stage which is to be acquired 
after diverting Indriyas into Manah, because it 
will only then be possible to attain the stage of 
stillness in the activities of the mind. 
3. To fix the mind into Soul36 - After withdrawing 
Indriyas into Manas, and getting Manas still, we 
have to fix our mind in the soul. Then the man 
becomes Vasi and due to the inaction of pain and 
pleasure ceases. The applications of these princi-
ples in practice have developed interpretive psy-
chotherapy. This method of psychoanalysis was 
developed originally by Freud and Jung. It con-
sists chiefly of three stages. 1. Interview, 2. Pa-
tients free expression of suppressed thought, 3. 
Stages of transference.  
The other types of Manonigraha are physician’s inter-
ference with patients mind control.  
This can be achieved by various ways:- 
1. By determining the thoughts process – Chintya 
2. By replacing the ideas – Vicharya  
3. By channeling the presumptions - Uhya 
4. By polishing the objectives – Dhyeya 
5. By proper guidance for taking the right decision – 
Sankalpa. 
Scope of Satvavajaya Chikitsa 
It is a typical Ayurvedic approach, which not only 
prevent the impairment of Dhi, Dhriti, Smriti but also 
brings them back to a normal state, place a significant 
role in the maintenance of a harmonious state be-
tween these three factors and ultimately leading to a 
happy-healthy state of individual.  
Preventive Aspect in Manas-Roga 
1- Pragyapradha Tyaga 
2- Indriyopshamanama (Indriyajaya)37 
3- Sadvritta Palana38 & Achara Rasayana Sevana39 
The summary or applied aspects of Satvavajaya 
Chikitsa is as –  
1. Assurance  
2. Replacement of emotions  
3. Regulation of thought process 
4. Retraining of ideas 
5. Channeling of presumptions  
6. Corrections of objectives and ideas 
7. Proper guidance for taking right decisions.  
8. Proper control of patience
