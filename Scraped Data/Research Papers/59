Longitudinal assessment of dental 
erosion-abrasion by cross-polarization 
optical coherence tomography in vitro
Abstract: This study tested a novel in vitro dental erosion-abrasion 
model and the performance of cross-polarization optical coherence 
tomography (CP-OCT) in longitudinally monitoring the simulated 
lesions. Thirty human enamel specimens were prepared and 
randomized to receive three dental erosion-abrasion (EA) protocols: 
severe (s-EA, lemon juice/pH:2.5/4.25%w/v citric acid), moderate 
(m-EA, grapefruit juice/pH:3.5/1.03%w/v citric acid) and no-EA (water, 
control). EA challenge was performed by exposing the specimens to 
acidic solutions 4x/day and to brushing 2x/day with 1:3 fluoridated 
toothpaste slurry, for 14 days. Enamel thickness measurements were 
obtained using CP-OCT at baseline (D0), 7 (D7) and 14 days (D14) and 
micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) at D14. Enamel surface loss 
was measured with both CP-OCT and optical profilometry at D0, D7 
and D14. Data was analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA and 
Pearson’s correlation (r) (α = 0.05). CP-OCT enamel thickness decreased 
over time in the s-EA group (D0 >D7 > D14, p < 0.001) and m-EA group 
(D0 > D14, p = 0.019) but did not change in the no-EA group (p = 0.30). 
Overall, CP-OCT and micro-CT results at D14 correlated moderately 
(r = 0.73). CP-OCT surface loss was highest for s-EA (p <0.001) but did 
not differ between moderate and no-EA (p = 0.25). Enamel surface 
loss with profilometry increased with severity (no-EA>m-EA>s-EA, 
p < 0.001). D14 surface loss was higher than D7 for both methods except 
for the no-EA group with profilometry. CP-OCT and profilometry had 
moderate overall correlation (r = 0.70). Our results revealed that the 
currently proposed in vitro dental erosion-abrasion model is valid and 
could simulate lesions of different severities over time. CP-OCT was a 
suitable method for monitoring the EA lesions.

Introduction
The irreversible nature of erosive tooth wear (ETW) substantiates the 
need for emphasis on the early detection, monitoring and use of specific 
preventive measures.1 This is because in its advanced stages, the treatment 
of ETW could become more difficult and case prognosis could become 
poorer. However, the differential diagnosis of early ETW lesions and their

Longitudinal assessment of dental erosion-abrasion by cross-polarization optical coherence tomography in vitro
clinical monitoring can be difficult,2 mostly due to the 
multitude of factors involved in their development 
and the lack of objective outcome measures.1
From a clinical standpoint, ETW is predominantly 
a surface phenomenon and its diagnostic procedure 
as well as progression assessment is traditionally 
done by visual examination, which is limited by its 
subjective nature.3 The use of objective methods for 
the clinical assessment of ETW has been suggested,4 
and among them optical coherence tomography 
(OCT) stands out.5,6 OCT allows for quick, safe, 
non-destructive, and repetitive measurements of 
enamel thickness;7 and previous studies have shown 
promising results.5,6,8,9 In order to improve some 
limitations on this method, such as surface reflection, 
variations of OCT were developed.7 Polarization-
sensitive OCT allows for higher contrast between 
sound and demineralized enamel, as well as for 
better dentin-enamel junction identification (DEJ).7
Along with the advances in ETW diagnosis and 
monitoring, there is still a need to improve research 
methods for the development and evaluation of 
anti-ETW agents. Previously, our group has proposed 
an in situ ETW model10 that could reliably be used 
for such purpose. More recently, it was confirmed 
that cross-polarization optical coherence tomography 
(CP-OCT) was suitable for monitoring ETW lesions 
of different severities formed using the said  
in situ model.11 
Nevertheless, while in situ studies are undoubtedly 
more clinically relevant than in vitro experiments, 
not all research laboratories are equipped to conduct 
such types of studies. Moreover, when evaluating 
experimental or novel anti-ETW agents, in vitro 
models would be more suitable in certain cases. 
The incorporation of mucin in artificial saliva has 
been found to produce in vitro lesions of similar 
surface loss with that of human saliva.12 However, 
most previous in vitro models  usually only involved 
short-term protocols.6,8 It is then necessary to also 
develop longer-term in vitro models of dental 
erosion and abrasion that could better simulate 
clinical ETW and provide more reliable conditions 
for the evaluation of agents that may be used for  
preventive strategies.
In this study, we tested the performance of CP-OCT 
in assessing ETW lesions of different severities 
simulated using a novel in vitro dental erosion-
abrasion (EA) model that mimicked the conditions of 
our previous in situ ETW model.11 Objective outcome 
measures used were enamel thickness and enamel 
surface loss validated by micro-computed tomography 
(micro-CT) and optical profilometry, respectively. 
Methodology
Study design
This study followed a blind, randomized 3 × 3 
factorial design wherein; EA lesion severity groups: 1)
severe (s-EA, lemon juice/pH:2.5/4.25%w/v citric acid), 
2) moderate (m-EA, grapefruit juice/pH: 3.5/1.03% 
w/v citric acid), and 3) no-EA (water, control) were 
assessed at time points: 1) baseline (D0), 2) Day 7 (D7), 
3) Day 14 (D14). Human enamel specimens (n = 10)  
were prepared and submitted to the longitudinal 
development of EA lesions simulating different 
severities by exposure to the different test solutions. 
The specimens were measured with CP-OCT and 
profilometry for all time points (D0, D7, D14) and 
micro-CT at D14. Outcome measures were enamel 
thickness (CP-OCT and micro-CT) and enamel surface 
loss (CP-OCT and Profilometry). Figure presents a 
schematic summary of the study procedures and 
representative CP-OCT images of a specimen from 
the s-EA group over time with corresponding enamel 
thickness measured from the enamel surface to the DEJ. 
Specimen preparation 
Round-shaped human enamel slabs (of 3 mm 
diameter and 2 mm thickness) were cut from extracted 
permanent molars that were cleaned and kept in 
0.1% thymol solution at 4°C. A total of thirty enamel 
specimens were prepared as previously described.10 
Briefly, the pulpal side of the cut enamel slabs were 
ground flat to a uniform thickness of 1.8 ± 0.2 mm. 
The top side (enamel) of the slab was then flattened 
and serially polished using 1,200- to 4,000-grit paper 
followed by 1-µm diamond polishing suspension to 
a final thickness of 1.5 ± 0.1 mm, with at least 1 mm 
of which was enamel. The sides of the slabs were 
cut with a precision cutting machine, so that their 
2

width was 1.5 mm. The enamel slabs were then 
cleaned under sonication and examined using a 
stereomicroscope. Slabs that were free from cracks, 
defects, or white spots were selected and glued into 
stainless steel holders using cyanoacrylate adhesive 
for medical use (Prism 4541; Loctite; Henkel, Rocky 
Hill, USA), with primer and accelerator (Prism 7701, 
713; Loctite). The grinding and polishing procedures 
were repeated, so that the surfaces of the enamel 
and the metal holders were leveled, flattened, and 
highly polished. Baseline surface loss measurements 
were taken using optical profilometry (details below) 
and specimens that showed vertical differences of 
> 1 µm between enamel and metal surfaces were 
further rejected. Accepted specimens were randomly 
assigned to the different groups (n = 10).
Dental erosion-abrasion lesion simulation
A summary of the daily cycling protocol involving 
erosion-abrasion procedures can be seen in Table 1. 
Both pH and titratable acidities of the erosive solutions 
were measured in triplicate prior to the start of the 
experiment. Erosive challenge was done 4x/day for 
14 days by immersion of the dental specimens for  
5 minutes in 10 ml, per specimen, of their respective 
acidic solutions:  pure lemon juice (Organic Pure 
Lemon Juice; Santa Cruz Natural Inc., Chico, USA) 
for the s-EA group; pure grapefruit juice (100% white 
grapefruit juice; Ocean Spray Cranberries, Lakeville-
Middleboro, USA) for the m-EA group, and bottled 
water (Drinking Water, Kroger Co., Cincinnati, 
USA) for the negative control, no-EA group. The 
enamel specimens were manually brushed twice 
daily (after the first and last acid immersion) for 15 
s using a soft-bristled manual toothbrush (Oral-B, 
Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, USA) and 45 ml, per 
specimen, of 1:3 slurry of fluoridated toothpaste 
(Crest Cavity Protection (0.243% NaF/ 0.15%w/v 
F-), Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati, USA) to simulate 
usual toothbrushing regimen. All the brushing 
procedures were performed by a single operator. The 
total exposure time of the specimens to the slurries 
was 2 min.  After brushing, the specimens were 
rinsed with deionized water. When not subjected 
to the erosive and abrasive procedures, specimens 
were kept in a remineralization solution (1.45 mM 
Ca, 5.4 mM PO4, 0.1 M Tris buffer, 2.2 g/L porcine 
gastric mucin, pH 7.0)12 under slight agitation at 
room temperature. The remineralization solution 
was renewed after every 24 h cycle.

Longitudinal assessment of dental erosion-abrasion by cross-polarization optical coherence tomography in vitro
Enamel thickness measurement
CP-OCT scanning and analysis
The specimens were kept moist in a container 
and were taken out and gently blotted dry prior to 
scanning to prevent dehydration. The specimens 
were then scanned and analyzed using a dental 
CP-OCT system (Santec Inner Vision IVS-300-S-L-C; 
Santec Corp, Komaki, Japan). Parameters similar to 
those previously used6,8,13 were adopted. In brief, 
the CP-OCT system used a swept laser light with 
a center wavelength of 1,310 nm, a-scan rate of 30 
kHz and imaging depth range (in air) of > 4 mm. 
Axial and lateral resolutions (in air) were ≤ 12 μm 
and 30 μm, respectively. The specimen to be scanned 
was positioned on an X-Y and Z translation stage 
and under the CP-OCT sensor, which was fixed in 
a positioning arm. The refractive index was set at 
1.6 for enamel. 3D scans were acquired using the 
scanning probe which had a lateral scanning area 
of 5 × 5 mm and working distance of 1 mm. Central 
b-scans (2D image) in the X direction were selected 
from each 3D scan and saved for measurements. All 
saved 2D image files were then randomized for blind 
analyses in terms of both time and severity. 
Enamel thickness measurements (from DEJ to 
surface of the specimen) on the 2D images were 
performed using Santec Inner Vision IVS-300 software 
(Santec Corp, Komaki, Japan) as previously described.6 
The measurement position was identified at the 
center of the enamel width with the aid of a screen 
ruler (A Ruler for Windows v3.3, Rob Latour). The 
distance in mm between the depths of the highest 
light intensity peaks at the enamel surface and DEJ 
areas was then calculated from the a-scan. CP-OCT 
scanning and enamel thickness measurements were 
performed at D0, D7 and D14.
Micro-CT scanning and analysis 
The enamel specimens were removed from 
the metal specimen holders after D14 and were 
scanned with a micro-computed tomography scanner 
(SkyScan1172; Bruker microCT, Kontich, Belgium) to 
produce high-resolution 3D models. The specimens 
were then mounted on a rotary stage and scanned at 59 
kV and 167µA with an X-ray beam perpendicular to the 
long axis of the specimen. A 0.5 mm aluminum filter 
was used for beam-hardening correction. Data were 
acquired and reconstructed applying previously used 
specifications.5,6 Scan reconstruction was performed 
using NRecon v1.7.3.1 (Skyscan, Bruker microCT) 
and viewed on the associated software (DataViewer 
v1.5.6.2, Skyscan, Bruker microCT) to obtain the central 
X-Z image that corresponds to the CP-OCT 2D scan 
position. The saved central X-Z images were then 
converted to bitmap (CT analyzer v1.17.7.2+, Skyscan, 
Bruker microCT) and were opened in Image J (ImageJ 
1.52a, NIH) for enamel thickness measurements. 
Measurement positions were determined by locating 
the midline of the enamel width using the screen

ruler (A Ruler for Windows v3.3.3). Enamel thickness 
was measured as the distance between the enamel 
surface and DEJ in mm using the straight-line tool 
at the measuring position.
Enamel surface loss measurement
CP-OCT analysis
Enamel surface loss with CP-OCT was determined 
as the subtracted difference of enamel thickness 
measurements at D7 and D14 from baseline values.
Optical profilometry scanning and analysis
Optical profilometry scans were obtained at D0, 
D7, and D14. The specimens were fixed on acrylic 
blocks with wax and then scanned using an optical 
profilometer (Proscan 2000; Scantron, Taunton, UK) 
with an accuracy of 0.1%, a precision (SD) of ± 0.06 
µm, and a detection limit of < 0.3 µm. The step size 
was set at 0.01 mm and the number of steps at 200 in 
the (x) axle; and 0.1 mm and 10, respectively, in the 
(y) axle. A surface area of 2 × 1 mm was scanned, 
comprising the reference metal and enamel surfaces. 
Using a dedicated software (Proscan 2000; Scantron), 
the depth of the treated enamel area was calculated 
in relation to the reference surfaces. A three-point 
height tool was used, which allowed the selection 
of a 1 × 1 mm area on the center of the enamel and 
two 1 × 0.5 mm areas on the adjacent metal surfaces. 
Measurements taken at D0, D7 and at the end of EA 
cycling, D14, were performed in a similar manner 
by an analyst blinded to the treatment regimens. 
Surface loss was calculated for each specimen based 
on the reference surfaces.
Statistical analysis
The effects of EA (s-EA, m-EA, no-EA) and time 
(D0, D7, D14) on CP-OCT enamel thickness and enamel 
surface loss and optical profilometry surface loss were 
analyzed using ANOVA models with repeated days 
within specimen. The effect of treatment on micro-CT 
enamel thickness at D14 was analyzed using one-way 
ANOVA. A natural logarithm transformation was 
used for the CP-OCT and optical profilometry surface 
loss analyses. Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r) and 
scatterplots were used to examine the relationships 
between the measurements. A 5% significance level 
was used for all tests.
Results
A significant interaction was observed between 
EA severity and days for CP-OCT enamel thickness 
(p < 0.001). Results for enamel thickness assessed 
with CP-OCT and micro-CT and their correlations 
are shown in Table 2. For s-EA, enamel thickness 
decreased from D0 to D7 to D14 (p<0.001). For moderate 
EA, enamel thickness decreased from D0 to D14 
(p=0.019), but D7 was not different from D0 (p = 0.10) 
or D14 (p = 0.46). There was no significant difference

Longitudinal assessment of dental erosion-abrasion by cross-polarization optical coherence tomography in vitro
among days for no-EA (p = 0.30). There were no 
differences in enamel thickness among the three 
EA groups (p = 0.76), regardless of treatment time. 
CP-OCT enamel thickness and micro-CT enamel 
thickness at D14 were moderately positively correlated 
overall (highly correlated for no-EA and m-EA but 
only weakly correlated for s-EA). 
CP-OCT surface loss results revealed no significant 
interaction between EA severity and days (p = 0.10). 
CP-OCT surface loss was significantly higher for 
s-EA than m-EA (p < 0.001) and no-EA (p < 0.001) 
while m-EA and no-EA were not different from each 
other (p = 0.25). D7 had significantly less surface 
loss than D14 (p = 0.002). On the other hand, a 
significant interaction between EA severity and days 
was observed for optical profilometry surface loss 
measurements (p < 0.001). For D7 and D14, optical 
profilometry surface loss increased with EA severity 
(no-EA<m-EA<s-EA, p < 0.001). No significant optical 
profilometry surface loss difference was found 
between days for no-EA (p = 0.92), but for moderate 
and severe EA, D7 had significantly less surface loss 
than D14 (p < 0.001). CP-OCT surface loss and optical 
profilometry surface loss were moderately correlated 
overall (r = 0.70, p < 0.001) and when grouped according 
to days (D7: r = 0.66; D14: r = 0.72) but poorly to 
moderately correlated when grouped according to 
severity and severity per day (r = 0.08–0.56). Table 3 
shows surface loss values for CP-OCT and profilometry 
for the different ETW severities and time points and 
their specific correlation coefficients. Correlations 
between surface loss and enamel thickness were 
generally negligible (between +/- 0.3).
Discussion
This study tested a novel model for the in vitro 
simulation of dental erosion-abrasion, adopted from 
our in situ ETW model.10,11 Moreover, it tested the 
performance of CP-OCT in detecting and monitoring 
the progression of the simulated in vitro lesions 
longitudinally. Two objective outcomes were studied: 
enamel thickness and enamel surface loss, calculated 
as the change in enamel thickness over time. Previous 
studies have already reported that CP-OCT was useful 
in assessing these parameters both in vitro6,8 and in 
situ.11 Nevertheless, earlier in vitro studies have only 
used short-term protocols.6,8
The current in vitro model simulated ETW lesions 
similar to those in the more clinically relevant  
in situ model.10-,1 Such a model would be useful for 
practical and more reliable laboratory development 
and evaluation of anti-ETW agents. It involved the 
use of mucin-containing artificial saliva, which 
has been reported to lead to similar surface loss 
results with that of human saliva in enamel erosion-
abrasion models in vitro.12 The addition of mucin 
has allowed the simulation of some functions of the 
pellicle.  The organic layer it formed on the tooth 
surface has been reported to provide protection 
against enamel surface demineralization,14 as well as 
interfered with remineralization12 similar to that of  
human saliva.  
However, even if the currently used conditions 
mimicked that of the in situ study,11 the magnitude of 
enamel surface loss (measured by optical profilometry) 
observed in vitro was higher than in situ (in vitro

vs. in situ, at D14: none: 2.31 vs. 0.62 µm; moderate: 
22.61 vs. 18.80 µm; severe: 134.09 vs. 98.78 µm). This 
result was not surprising because even if mucin 
was present in the artificial saliva used, different 
biologic factors could not be simulated. As such, 
other salivary proteins from the acquired pellicle,15 
the saliva buffering and clearing capacities as well 
as the absence of oral mucosal surfaces for greater 
fluoride substantivity were not present and is thus 
a limitation of this in vitro study. 
Our results for the CP-OCT enamel thickness 
showed a lack of EA treatment severity effect. This 
could be attributed to the high variation in enamel 
thickness among the specimens. Effect of time, 
on the other hand, was evident for both moderate 
and severe EA groups but not for the no-EA group, 
corroborating the results of our in situ study.11 Enamel 
thickness decreased significantly after every time 
point with the s-EA group and between D0 and D14 
for the m-EA group. There was no difference over 
time with the no-EA group. These findings suggest 
that while CP-OCT may not be able to differentiate 
EA severities cross-sectionally, it can be useful for 
the longitudinal monitoring the progression of EA 
lesions within the same tooth. 
Overall, the enamel thickness measurements 
with CP-OCT at D14 correlated moderately with 
micro-CT. More specifically, a strong correlation 
was observed for the no-EA and m-EA groups, 
but a weak correlation existed for the s-EA group. 
This could be due to the difficulty in locating the 
actual DEJ in CP-OCT images, especially in several 
specimens in the s-EA group. Previous studies 
have similarly found loss of DEJ details in some 
of their scans.8,16,17 It was reported that the degree 
of demineralization and surface micromorphology 
do not affect CP-OCT measurements.8 However, 
differences likely existed in the lesion characteristics 
of the enamel specimens in the present study from 
those that had been previously examined.6,8,11 Present 
study conditions could have effects on both de- 
and remineralization, which could respectively 
increase or decrease enamel surface reflectivity 
with OCT.18 Enamel porosity also increases with 
demineralization and results to  higher scattering 
coefficients.19 These factors could then affect the 
OCT optical penetration depth and ultimately, the 
capability of CP-OCT in assessing enamel thickness 
and enamel surface loss. Likewise, the hydration 
state of enamel affects its optical properties.20,21 
Dehydration of demineralized specimens would 
then cause a greater increase in light scattering due 
to refractive index mismatch, consequently resulting 
in higher attenuation and a poorer resolution of 
the DEJ.16 Thus, interpretation of results for the 
s-EA group must be taken with caution due to 
these limitations. 
Similar to CP-OCT, micro-CT offers a non-
destructive method that can take repeated 
measurements from the same position in the 
specimen.6,8,22 However, micro-CT tomograms were 
done only at D14 after the enamel slab was detached 
from the metal specimen holder, due to the inherent 
limitations of using metal with a radiographic method. 
Metal holders were utilized in order to have reliable 
and stable reference surfaces over the extended period 
of erosion-abrasion challenges.
The enamel surface loss measured by optical 
profilometry increased with EA severity (no-EA<m-
EA<s-EA), for both D7 and D14, similarly to our in 
situ study.11 Likewise, no increase in surface loss 
over time was observed for the no-EA group in both 
studies, validating this dental erosion-abrasion in 
vitro model. These findings were generally similar 
to the trends observed with CP-OCT. A moderate 
overall correlation was observed between our 
CP-OCT and optical profilometry enamel surface 
loss results, which was also consistent with our in 
situ findings.11 Nevertheless, specific correlations 
according to severity and severity per day were 
only poor to moderate. Differences in the sensitivity 
between CP-OCT and optical profilometry have 
been pointed out before as a possible reason.8 The 
axial resolution of CP-OCT at ≤ 12 μm produces 
less accurate measurements compared to optical 
profilometry. The smaller range of measurements per 
group in comparison to the overall range across all 
severities as well as the lower number of specimens 
per group in this study compared to the previous 
in situ study11 could have contributed to the poor 
individual group correlation but better overall 
correlation between the two methods.

Longitudinal assessment of dental erosion-abrasion by cross-polarization optical coherence tomography in vitro
Conclusions
Our results confirm the validity of this novel in 
vitro erosion-abrasion model, which can potentially 
be used for future testing of anti-erosion-abrasion 
agents in the laboratory. Even if the values obtained 
with CP-OCT were not directly interchangeable with 
micro-CT and optical profilometry, CP-OCT reflected 
similar trends for both enamel thickness and enamel 
surface loss parameters. These findings are consistent 
with our previous in situ study11 and indicates that 
CP-OCT can be used to longitudinally monitor the 
erosion-abrasion lesions formed within the same 
tooth in this in vitro model. Caution however should 
be exercised when handling specimens of the severe 
EA group as their propensity for dehydration might 
negatively affect the CP-OCT applicability for this 
specific EA model.
