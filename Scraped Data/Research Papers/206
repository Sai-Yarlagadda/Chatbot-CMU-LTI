ABSTRACT
Plant-frugivore interactions are important ecological processes that play a vital role in maintaining the
dynamics of the ecosystem. Birds are very important frugivores and very little is known about the plant-
avian interaction matrix in the urban ecosystems of India. The present study endeavours to understand
and document the plant–avian frugivory interactions in the human-dominated green spaces which is a
mosaic of selectively planted exotic and native tree species in Delhi. A total of thirty avian frugivore species
were recorded feeding on twenty-two focal tree species using phyto-centric approach. Characteristic traits
of fruits like fruit diameter, colour and type and their interacting avian species were studied based on their
fruit handling behaviour. The highest number of avian frugivore species were observed on native Ficus tree
species in urban Delhi ecosystem, thereby providing evident proof of being an important food resource for
avian disperser communities. The study suggests to introduce more native fig tree species in the city
plantations to enhance and sustain the avian diversity in the novel fragmented urban ecosystems.
Key words: Urban ecosystem, Delhi, Phyto-centric approach
Introduction
Seed dispersal is the most important dynamic pro-
cess in the life history of plants as it promotes
smooth gene flow within and among plant popula-
tions. Expansion implies dispersal of immobile
plants species as they require some mechanism to
disperse their diaspores to new habitable areas (van
der Pijl, 1982). Successful dissemination of seeds in-
volve a variety of biotic and abiotic dispersal factors
(Jordano et al., 2007). Dispersal of seeds by
frugivores is one of the ancient ecological processes
that has driven global plant evolution and diversifi-
cation. It allows plants to reduce competition among
kin and to colonize new, suitable habitats. Among
biotic dispersers, birds play a very crucial role in the
seed dispersal process in many tropical and temper-
ate ecosystems as they feed on fleshy fruits and de-
posit (via excretion or regurgitation) the seeds away
from the parent plant (Herrera, 1995; Jordano and
Schupp, 2000; Whelan et al., 2008). In tropical and
subtropical Asia, 65% to 90% of woody plant species
are dispersed by vertebrates, with birds dispersing
maximum species of plant species (Corlett, 2011;
Datta and Rawat, 2008 and Ganesh and Davidar,
2001). Various factors, like fruit crop size, fruiting
phenology, and the fruit’s size, structure, scent and
chemical composition of pulp, seed size and texture

influence how fruit species are utilized by frugivores
(Howe and Miriti, 2004) while the body size, gape
size, mass of frugivore birds are used as the charac-
teristics of feeding patterns ( Zhang et al., 2022).
Urbanization is one of the most important threats
to biodiversity and one of the key causes of local
species extinction (McKinney, 2006). Urban green
spaces like parks, gardens, avenues within cities and
towns are examples of unique ecosystems that have
developed as a result of the coexistence of novel spe-
cies mixtures and environmental conditions (Baiser
et al., 2012; Cruz et al., 2013; Hobbs et al., 2006;
McKinney, 2006). Avenue trees that are commonly
exotic, are planted on roadsides, parks and gardens,
face anthropogenic selective pressures which in-
clude fragmentation, degradation of habitat and
defaunation in urban areas increasing the vulner-
ability of interactions involving homogenization of
urban avian frugivores by generalist mediated seed
dissemination. (Gelmi-Candusso and Hämäläinen,
2019; McConkey and O’Farrill, 2016; Ruxton and
Schaefer, 2012; Stanley and Arceo-Gomez, 2020). As
a result, urbanisation is anticipated to have a major
impact on the abundance and characteristics of
frugivores, which will have important repercussions
for the success of introduced and native plant popu-
lations in urban settings (Stanley and Arceo-Gomez,
2020). Various animals adapt and evolve alongside
with the changes in urban green spaces. Together,
these organisms create unique, intriguing urban
habitats that are required to be investigated thor-
oughly in order to understand the novel urban eco-
system.
In Asia, India is an important contributor to the
current global urban explosion in cities. Increased
urbanization has created challenges for manage-
ment of natural areas within cities (Nagendra et al.,
2013). Delhi being one of the world’s largest cities is
not an exception. However, biotic interactions in
particular the plant-frugivore interaction urban eco-
systems are negligibly studied and documented in
India. Investigating interactions and their complex-
ity helps to comprehend about ecological and evolu-
tionary processes in the anthropocentric landscapes
(Bascompte and Jordano, 2007; Ings et al., 2009;
Strauss and Irwin, 2004; Vittoz and Engler, 2007).
The present study aims to identify the plant – avian
interaction in the fruiting tree species in the urban-
ized centre of Delhi providea baseline data towards
understanding of novel dispersal dynamics of im-
portant tree species in the urban green spaces.
Materials and Methods
Study site
Delhi covers an area of 1483 sq. km and lies in a hu-
mid subtropical climate having a hot summer with
temperature reaching up to 46 ºC from May to July
and a cold winter  from November to February

Eco. Env. & Cons. 29 (August Suppl. Issue) : 2023
(Krishen, 2007) with an average annual rainfall of 60
cm from August to September. It comprises of
18,000 parks and gardens in about 80 sq.km at vari-
ous locations (Delhi Society of Parks and Gardens,
2023). The present study was undertaken from Janu-
ary 2021 to December 2022. The seed dispersal pat-
tern was studied in the urban green spaces of hu-
man-dominated landscape of Delhi in Dwarka (28°
32’ to 28° 38’ North and 77° 0’ to 78° 8’ East) region
in the south-west district of Delhi (Delhi Develop-
ment Authority, 2023). This region is recent urban
extension that has a complex pattern of urbanization
with mosaic of green spaces, avenue trees and con-
crete buildings. Remnants of natural vegetation
comprises of ‘thorn forest’ still persist among the
green spaces of this region (Krishen, 2007). The other
important feature of the study area is the Najafgarh
drain, a significant man-made feature and sur-
rounding agricultural lands, provides a suitable
habitat for a variety of bird species in this region.
Numerous fleshy fruit tree species planted in parks,
gardens and avenues attracts many avian
frugivores.
Methodology
A total of 22 focal tree species were selected on the
basis of their dominance in avenues, parks and gar-
dens. The phenology and fruiting period of these
tree species were noted from Maheshwari (1963)
and Krishen (2007) and recorded visually in the
study area. The avian frugivores interacting with the
selected focal tree species were directly observed
through extended tree watches in the field following
phyto-centric approach (Jordano, 2016). Data on
avian visitors and fruit handling technique was ob-
tained through tree watches (Bollen et al., 2004). Tree
watches were done early morning between 0600 hrs.
and 0900 hrs and evening between 1630 hrs to 1800
hrs during summers and 0700 hrs. to 1000 hrs. in the
morning and 1600 hrs to 1700 hrs in winters from a
hideout that was set up about 15-20 meters away
using Nikon Action EX (8 X 40) binoculars. No ob-
servations were made on windy, foggy and rainy
days.
Avian frugivore species were observed and iden-
tified using manual of Grimmett et al., 2012. Plant-
avian interactions were photographed using Sony
alpha 600 digital camera. Frugivores were also ob-
served and categorized according to their feeding
guild as chiefly frugivore, omnivore, granivore and
insectivorous. Gape width and mass for each avian
frugivore was recorded using secondary data.
Avian frugivores were observed and photographed
using Sony alpha 600 camera and categorized on the
basis of fruit handling behavior as gulpers, mashers
and peckers (Levey, 1987). Avian frugivores were
also given codes as provided in Table 2.
Ripe fruits were collected and photographed in
the field from beneath the fruiting tree species in the
field. Photographs of ripe fruits were also taken in
the lab using a stereomicroscope MZ12.5. Fruit color
namely black-purple, brown, red, green, yellow and
orange (Willson and Thompson, 1982; Wheelwright
and Janson, 1985), and fruit type (Shivanna and
Tandon, 2014) were observed and recorded. Diam-
eters of fruits were also measured using digital ver-
nier caliper. Maximum of 50 samples of each fruit

species were taken for measurement. Data collected
from the field were analysed using MS-Excel and
IBM SPSS Statistics version 21.
Results
Focal tree species phenologyand composition
Fruiting period of 22 focal tree species belonging to
17 genera of 12 families were observed which peak
in the month of March (15 species). It was observed
that fruits of Moraceae flushed twice in a year asyn-
chronously (Fig. 2). Among 22 tree species, 4 tree
species namely Acacia auriculiformis, Leucaena
leucocephala, Azadirachta indica and Morus alba are
exotic (Table 1).
Feeding guild and dietary composition of avian
frugivores
A total of 30 species of avian frugivores were ob-
served foraging on the focal fruit-bearing tree spe-
cies. Maximum avian frugivores (67%) were
Passeriformes and common myna was found to feed
on 12(54%) fruiting tree species, while red-vented

bulbul consumed 11(50%) fruit species. About
57.66% of avian species consuming fruits were om-
nivorous while only 33% were chiefly frugivorous.
Alexandrine parakeets, brown-headed barbet, cop-
per-smith barbet, golden oriole, Indian gray horn-
bill, red-vented bulbul, red whiskered bulbul, rose-
ringed parakeet and yellow footed green pigeon
were chiefly frugivorous species while common
myna, followed by Asian koel, house crow, Indian
white eye and rufous tree pie were observed as om-
nivores that relied on fruiting tree species. Only 10%
granivores were observed to be feeding on fruiting
tree species. Asian koelwas also observed handling
11 fruiting tree species.
Most of the avian frugivores were observed to
consume fruits of Ficus religiosa followed by
F.benghalensis, F. virens, Morus alba, F. benjamina and
F. amplissima (Fig. 5). Fig-eating birds were found to
have feeding guilds ranging from almost completely
insectivorous (common tailor bird, red-breasted fly-
Fig. 5(A). Mean fruit diameter handled by avian frugivore (B) Frequency of avian frugivore species handling fruits
species, along with their respective fruit diameter
catcher) to entirely frugivorous (yellow-footed green
pigeon, rose-ringed parakeets, alexandrine para-
keets). Among all avian frugivores, passerines were
observed to handle maximum fig tree species.
Rose-ringed parakeets and Alexandrine para-
keets consumed a maximum of 19(86%) out of 22
fruiting tree species. Among non- fig species, fruits
of Morus alba were handled maximum by frugivore
species. Surprisingly no avian frugivore was ob-
served on Mimusops elengi. (Fig. 5B). Yellow-footed
green pigeon, Coppersmith barbet and brown
headed barbet were observed to feed on Ficus spe-
cies.
Fruit characters and its effects on avian assemblage
Fruit type, colour, and diameter were also deter-
mined for the selected focal fruiting tree species
(Table 1). Four types of fruits were observed, which
included: Syconia (Figs) (Ficus amplissima, F.
benjamina, F. benghalensis, F. racemosa, F. religiosa and
F. virens), drupes (Azadirachta indica, Ehretia laevis,
Melia azedarach, Phyllanthus emblica, Polyalthania
longifolia Putranjiva roxburghii, Syzygium cumini,
Terminalia arjuna, Ziziphus mauritiana)berries
(Mimusops elengi, Morus alba) and pods(Acacia
auriculiformis, Albizia lebbeck, Alstonia scholaris, Cassia
fistula, Leucaena leucocephala). Maximum frugivore
species were found to be feeding on syconia, fol-
lowed by drupe, berry and pods (Fig. 3 and 4). Syco-
nia (figs) were consumed by all frugivorous species
found in the study area. Drupes were consumed
maximum by alexandrine parakeet and rose-ringed
parakeet followed byred-vented bulbul. Woody fi-

berry of Phyllanthus emblica and pods of Acacia
auriculiformis, Albizia lebbeck, Alstonia scholaris,
Leucaena leucocephala were only predated by alexan-
drine parakeet androse-ringed parakeet for its seed,
while fruits of Ficus species were crushed in the bills
and small seeds were ingested along with pulp (Fig.
4).
A high proportion of black-purple colored fruits
followed by bright red observed belonged to
Moraceae family except F. virens which are pale-yel-
low colored. Maximum fruits handled by frugivores
were of black-purple color followed by bright-red.
Least number of fruits handled were of orange color
(Fig. 4).
Fruit diameter were highly variable and ranged
from 36 mm (Phyllanthus emblica) to 4 mm (Ehretia
laevis) (Fig. 2B). Fruit choices and handling
behaviour of avian frugivores were also influenced
by the fruit diameter and gape size of avian
frugivores. Maximum proportion (50%) of fruits
handled by the frugivores ranged from 10-15
mm.77% of fruits with diameter  15 mm were
handled by frugivores (Fig. 6). Gape width of
frugivores varied from 5.4 mm to 54.29 mm (Table
2) and mean fruit diameter was found to be posi-
tively correlated with the gape width (rs = 0.40397, p
(2-tailed) = 0.02683.) and body mass of the frugivore
(rs = 0.42817, p (2-tailed) = 0.01825). However, there
was no correlation between the mean fruit diameter
and number frugivore species visiting the focal tree
species (rs = 0.173, p (2-tailed) = 0.221) (Fig. 6).
Fruit handling behaviour
The frugivores in the study area comprised 47%
obligatory peckers, 30% obligatory gulpers, 17%
peckers and gulpers and only 7% mashers (Fig.7).
House crow, rufous tree pie, jungle babbler, Indian
white eye, common tailor bird were observed to be
the major peckers in the study area. Red vented bul-
bul, red whiskered bulbul, common myna, were
observed to swallow small sized fruits while pecked
the pulp of large sized fruit. They were observed
pecking on fruits of Ficus benghalensis, Meliaazedarach
and Syzygium cumini while gulping the complete
fruits of F. religiosa, F.amplissima, F. benjamina,
F.virens and Morus alba. Indian gray hornbill, yellow-
footed green pigeon, Asian koel, coppersmith barbet
and brown headed barbet were observed as major
gulpers in the study area. They swallowed the com-
plete fruit irrespective of the fruit diameter due to
their large gape size. Onlyalexandrine parakeets and
rose-ringed parakeets mashed the fruits externally
in their bills and were much less gape-limited, there-
fore were observed to consume maximum fruit spe-
cies in the study area (Fig. 4).
Discussion
The avian frugivore assemblage in the urban land-
scape of Delhi is typically complex since it is a novel
ecosystem with maximum number of tree species
are selectively planted. But due to lower number of
dispersal studies in urban landscapes in India, there
is a need to study these plant-frugivore interactions.
Fruit traits
A total of 30 species of avian frugivores were ob-
served in the Dwarka sub city of South-West Delhi
handling diverse variety of fruits. Our investigation
revealed the significance of fruit traits like fruit di-
ameter (Howe and Estrabook, 1977), type (Wenny
and Levey, 1998) and color (Wheelwright and
Janson, 1985) that are responsible for attracting
avian dispersers in the novel landscape.
Fruit size play a significant role in fruit selection
of avian frugivores (Howe and Estabrook, 1977;
Fig.6(A). Correlation between gape width of frugivore and mean fruit diameter(B) Correlation between body mass of
avian frugivores and the mean fruit diameter (C) Correlation between number of frugivore species handling
the fruits and mean fruit diameter in the study area

Leighton and Leighton, 1983). It is important for a
frugivore to adapt, for efficient handling of
fruits.Our results showing the maximum handling
of fruits with diameter  15 mm is supported by the
optimum foraging theory where medium sized
fruits were chosen over small and large sized fruits
for acquiring high energy with lowest efforts
(Wheelwright, 1985). Medium-sized fruits are often
easier for birds to handle and manipulate as com-
pared to large fruits as they are small enough to be
consumed by smaller bird species, but also attractive
enough to larger bird species like Indian gray horn-
bill, yellow footed green pigeon to be transported
over longer distances. Similar results were also re-
ported in the study from Sriharikota where avian
fruits were generally small ( 10 mm) in diameter
(David et al., 2011). This shows that efficient han-
dling of a given fruit is determined by the fruit size
relative to the body size of avian frugivore, specifi-
cally the gape width and body mass in the mutual-
istic frugivory networks.
It was found that as the gape size of birds in-
creased, the number of fruit species handled also
increased. Positive correlation between gape widths
and fruit diameter have also been reported earlier
((Bender et al., 2018; Naniwadekar et al., 2019;
Palacio et al., 2016; Stevenson et al., 2005; Wheel-
wright, 1985). All the frugivorous species observed
in the present study with large gape size were legiti-
mate seed disperser as they swallowed the complete
fruit and dropped the seeds away from the parent
plants. Asian koel proves to be a legitimate seed dis-
perser as it swallowed a wide array of fruit species
in the urban green spaces due to its large gape size.
For successful dissemination of seeds away from the
parent plant, fruits produced should be of size that
can be swallowed by the maximum frugivorous
community. However, it is important to note that
the relationship between gape size and fruit diam-
eter is not always straight forward. Other factors,
such as the shape and texture of the fruit, can also
influence a bird’s ability to consume it. Additionally,
some bird species may be able to manipulate larger
fruits to make them easier to consume, using tech-
niques such as pecking or breaking the fruit into
smaller pieces. It is evident from our observations
that synanthropic species like common myna and
red-vented bulbul handled fruits depending on the
fruit diameter; fruits with diameter greater than the
gape size were pecked while fruits with smaller di-
ameter were swallowed.
Fruit color has also been the most extensively
studied fruit trait, owing to the fact that various
avian frugivores perceive different colors, and this
has played a crucial role in determining the evolu-
tionary selection of plant species. (Hill et al., 2021).
Maximum fruits of black-purple followed by red
color were handled by the frugivores in the present
study. However, unripe green fruits of only Ficussp.
were observed to be handled at the same time. This
shows adaptation become an opportunistic
frugivore is in process but reasons are still not clear
(Snow, 1971). Fruits with dark color and high con-
trast against the foliage indicate the ripening and
maturity of fruits giving feeding cues for avian spe-
cies (Wheelwright and Janson, 1985). Similar results
were obtained in the study conducted in Point
Calimere Wildlife Sanctuary in South India, red fol-
lowed by black coloured fruits were preferred by
avian 
frugivores 
(Balasubramanian 
and
Maheswaran, 2003). However, according to
Kamruzzaman and Asmat (2008), dominant fruit
color choices made by avian frugivores are red,
green and yellow respectively.
Among all fruit types, present study confirmed
that maximum frugivores were attracted by syconia
(fig) tree species. The ease with which figs were
handled by diverse assemblages of avian frugivores
ranging from small passerine birds like Indian white
eye, red-vented bulbul to medium and large-bodied
birds like yellow-footed green pigeon, barbets, In-
dian grey hornbill, parakeets, the crow contribute to
the unique role that Ficus plays in frugivore survival
in the urban landscape of Delhi. In the present study
F. religiosa and F. benghalensis attracted maximum
frugivore species. Soft flesh of figs can be penetrated
by the bills of birds that are unable to swallow the
whole fruit. These urban fig communities easily
thrive in the urban areas like sides of buildings and
stones and play a very important role in maintaining
its avian frugivore diversity thereby providing us an
opportunity to look at the relationships between an
entire fig flora and an entire frugivore fauna
(Harrison, 2005; Lambert and Marshall, 1991;
Leighton, 1983; Milton et al.,1982; Shanahan et al.,
2001; Sreekar et al., 2010; Terborgh,  1986).Therefore,
figs (Ficus spp.) are considered to be keystone plant
resources for many tropical forests such as those in
Panama (Korine et al., 2000), South Africa (Bleher et
al., 2003), Peninsular Malaya (Lambert and Marshall
1991), India (Kannan and James, 1999), and Indone-
sia (Leighton and Leighton, 1983).

Frugivore Assemblage
Frugivore assemblage in the urban landscape of
Delhi is typically complex. Frugivores of
passeriformes order belonging to family Sturnidae,
Pycnonotidae and Corvidae were predominant
frugivores in the human dominated landscape of
Delhi. Earlier studies have also shown that members
of the Sturnidae family, members of Pycnonotida
family like red-vented bulbul and red-whiskered
bulbul are very important frugivores in the human
dominated landscape of subtropical Asia
(Balasbramanian, 1996; Corlett, 1998; David et al.,
2011; Levey, 1987). These trends are also confirmed
in the subtropical forests in Hong Kong (Corlett,
1998) and Yakushima Island (Noma and Yumoto,
1997). These results confirm that small to medium
sized birds are more common frugivores in the ur-
ban disturbed landscape as they are more resilient
and adapted to high level disturbances (Blanco et al.,
2019).
Rose-ringed and alexandrine parakeets were also
found to be opportunistic frugivores as they
handled maximum number of native and exotic
fruiting tree species and predated on almost all fruit
types found in the study area. They predated on
pods of Acacia auriculiformis Albizia lebbeck, Alistonia
scholaris, Cassia fistula and Lecaena leucocephala. Fruits
of Alistonia scholaris planted along the avenues are
reported to be dispersed by wind but we observed
that their fruits were predated by parakeets. This
shows thatthey are experimenting and developing
new dynamics with the fruiting tree species to
evolve and better adapt to the novel plant mixture
in urban green spaces. However, besides being a
frugivore it is a seed predator, and therefore can be
categorized as dyszoochorous species since they
destroy the seeds and causes immense damage to
the fruits (Rasmussen and Anderton, 2005).
This study provided a first ever baseline record of
plant-avian frugivore interactions in the human-
dominated landscape of South-west Delhi that are
comparable to those at other study locations in
Southeast Asia. Our study suggests that fruit con-
sumption by avian frugivores is highly influenced
by fruit colour, size and type. Fruit handling
behaviour of avian frugivores determine the effec-
tive dispersal of seeds. Fig tree species attracted all
the avian frugivore species observed and can be con-
sidered as the keystone species due to the fruit avail-
ability and being soft and fleshy made it easily ac-
cessible for all avian frugivores irrespective of their
gape size. Therefore, the study of plant-frugivore
mutualistic interactions and their consequences for
individual plant fitness has become crucial for un-
derstanding ecological systems which are novel in
fragmented urban habitats (Bronstein et al., 2006;
Valiente Banuet et al., 2014).
