Abstract—Despite the growing interest in reconfigurable 
intelligent surfaces (RISs) for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) bands, 
and the considerable theoretical work reported by the 
communication community, there is a limited number of published 
works demonstrating practical implementations and experimental 
results. To the authors’ knowledge, no published literature has 
reported experimental results for RISs covering the n257 and n258 
mm-wave bands. In this work, we propose a novel wideband RIS 
design that covers the entire mm-wave 5G n257 and n258 bands. 
In simulations, the unit cell can maintain a phase difference of 180° 
± 20° and a reflection magnitude greater than -2.8 dB within 22.7 
to 30.5 GHz (29.3% bandwidth) using one-bit PIN switches. The 
proposed unit cell design with four circular cutouts and long vias 
could realize wideband performance by exciting two adjacent 
high-order resonances (2.5f and 3.5 f). The periodic unit cells can 
maintain an angular stability of ± 30°. Based on the proposed unit 
cell, a 20×20 RIS array is designed and fabricated with a size of 
7.1λ×7.1λ. The measurement results demonstrate that the 
proposed RIS could maintain a 3 dB peak gain variation 
bandwidth among various array configurations within 22.5 to 29.5 
GHz (26.9%) and with a beam scanning capability of 50°, making 
this design a good candidate for 5G mm-wave applications.

I. INTRODUCTION 
ECENLTY, fifth-generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mm-
wave) communication systems have received significant 
commercial and research attention due to their sizeable 
available bandwidth [1-5]. Although the 5G mm-wave system 
could significantly improve the data rate and communication 
capacity, the electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation suffers 
from a higher atmospheric attenuation. Thus, at such 
frequencies, the EM waves can get severely affected or even 
blocked by obstacles, causing signal blind spots and restricting 
the system to line of sight (LOS) communication. Such a 
problem is even more visible beyond the 5G network with 
increased 
quality-of-service 
requirements 
and 
higher 
frequencies. A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is 
beneficial to solve this problem because it can help establish a 
secondary LOS to maintain the communication link when a

blockage occurs in the direct path between the transmitter (Tx) 
and receiver (Rx) [6]. A conceptual scheme of the RIS in a 
practical urban environment with multiple signal blind spots is 
depicted in Fig. 1, where the RIS is able to provide a second 
LOS to address the blind spots. This RIS-based wireless 
communication is controllable and programmable, which 
means that there can be unprecedented opportunities for 
improving the quality of service for wireless communication 
systems [6]. 
Despite the great performance enhancement promise of RISs, 
there is not much experimental evidence in published literature 
supports these claims. Most published works focus on the ideal 
RIS and are limited to theoretical analyses. For example, [7] 
reported an ideal and theoretical RIS for energy-efficient 
downlink multiuser communication applications. Similarly, [8] 
proposed the concept of RIS-assisted communications to the 
realm of index modulation. In addition, [9] and [10] reported on 
optimization methods for RIS beamforming for wireless 
network designs. 
However, published literature related to practical RIS 
designs and their experimental characterization, particularly for 
mm-wave bands, is scarce. Out of the experimental studies, 
majority have been conducted on the sub-6 GHz band [11–14], 
and some operate at around 10 GHz [15], [16]. Few reports have 
addressed practical RIS designs operating at mm-wave bands. 
For example, [17] proposed a practical RIS design and 
performed near- and far-field measurements for signal 
enhancement. However, the working bandwidth for the design

[17] is from 27.5 to 29.5 GHz (7% bandwidth), which cannot 
fulfill the large bandwidth requirements for 5G mm-wave band. 
Shekhawat et al. [18], [19] designed a compact unit cell and a 
25×32-element RIS prototype working at 28.5 GHz, but the 
operation bandwidth was not provided. Rains et al. [20] 
proposed a unit cell design based on varactors. However, the 
results were obtained from a simulation, and no experimental 
results were demonstrated. Moreover, the bandwidth is still 
narrow, so the unit cell phase shift within the 180° ± 20° can be 
maintained between 24.7 and 26.6 GHz (7.5%). The 5G mm-
wave frequency bands contain n257 (26.5 to 29.5 GHz), n258 
(24.25 to 27.5 GHz), n259 (39.5 to 43.5 GHz), n260 (37 to 40 
GHz) and n261 (27.5 to 28.35 GHz) bands. Therefore, the 
designed RIS for the n257 and n258 bands (n261 is within the 
n257 band) needs to cover the bandwidth from 24.25 to 29.5 
GHz (19.5%), which is challenging and there is no previously 
reported work that has realized wideband PIN-switch-based 
RIS to cover this 5G mm-wave band (24.25 to 29.5 GHz).  
In this work, we designed, fabricated, and tested a novel 5G 
mm-wave RIS. A novel unit cell design of patches with four 
circular cutouts is proposed to satisfy the sizeable bandwidth 
requirements for the 5G mm-wave band. The proposed unit cell 
demonstrates wideband performance by exciting two adjacent 
high-order resonant modes (2.5 f and 3.5 f ) with the help of four 
circular cutouts on the edge of the patch element, fully covering 
the 5G mm-wave n257 and n258 bands (24.25 to 29.5 GHz). 
The design maintains a simple structure with three layers 
(patch, ground, and biasing network layers). The PIN switches 
are designed on the backside of the RIS, avoiding interference 
from diodes and soldering pads. The designed unit cell structure 
provides adequate space for biasing line routing. A final 20×20 
array with a size of 7.1λ×7.1λ is characterized using a two-horn 
measurement setup. The result reveal a 3 dB gain bandwidth 
from 22.5 to 29.5 GHz (26.9%) and a 50° beam-scanning range. 
II. UNIT CELL DESIGN AND SIMULATION 
Generally, the RIS is constructed using an array of unit cell 
elements with tunable electromagnetic resonators, which could 
modify the reflective waves by controlling the characteristic of 
each unit cell, such as the resonant frequency, reflection 
amplitude, phase, and polarization. Meanwhile, the RIS design 
should be distinguished from reconfigurable reflectarray 
designs [21-24] because reflectarrays have a fixed incident feed 
location and generally work in the near-field region for the 
feeding source antenna. Thus, reflectarray designs optimize the 
feed antenna and reflectarray elements to achieve optimum 
performance. The RIS, however, mainly concentrates on the 
reconfigurable element design and the surface distribution. 
In this work, the structure of the proposed unit cell design is 
depicted in Fig. 2. The top metallic layer is a square patch 
whose side length is 3 mm. There are four 1.1 mm radius 
circular cutouts at its four edges, and the total length is 3.85 
mm. Two side edges of the patch element are connected with 
vias (0.1 mm radius), which pass through two circular cutouts 
(0.35 mm radius) on the middle ground to attach the feeding 
network at the bottom layer. The top substrate is a 1.575 mm 
Rogers 5880 (ԑr = 2.2, tan δ = 0.0009) which is low loss and 
suitable for 5G mm-wave application. Behind the middle 
ground plane layer is the bottom substrate with a 0.2 mm FR4 
(ԑr = 4.4, tan δ = 0.02) which has less effect on unit cell 
performance. Two substrate layers are laminated by a 0.1 mm 
FR4 prepreg sheet (ԑr = 4.4, tan δ = 0.02). The PIN switches are 
the commercially available type MADP-000907-14020P in 
MACOM, which displays decent performance in the mm-wave 
band. One side of the PIN switch is connected with the middle 
ground through a short via, whereas the other side of the switch 
is connected with the top patch layer by a long via. By adjusting 
the biasing current, the PIN switch could work in two different 
states, ON and OFF, to achieve reconfigurability. A radio 
frequency (RF) choke is employed at the end of the long via, 
ensuring that the unit cell RF performance is not affected by the 
direct current (DC) feeding lines. 
Some innovations of the proposed unit cell design are as 
follows. First, the proposed unit cell design possesses wideband 
performance due to the incorporation of circular cutouts into the 
square patch compared with the traditional square patch. The 
S11 phase performance of the proposed unit cell design and the 
typical square patch unit cell when the PIN switches are in the 
ON/OFF states is illustrated in Fig. 3. It can be observed that 
the proposed unit cell with circular cutouts demonstrates steady 
slope for both of the ON and OFF states (Fig. 3(a)), whereas the 
traditional square patch unit cell has a nonuniform phase 
variation for ON/OFF states (Fig. 3(b)). Specifically, the 
180°±20° phase difference between the ON and OFF states of 
the proposed unit cell design could be maintained in a wide 
band from 22.7 to 30.5 GHz (29.3%) and the reflection 
magnitude is greater than -2.8 dB in this bandwidth, as 
demonstrated in Fig. 4. The wideband characteristic is 
attributed to two adjacent resonant modes of 2.5f (23.1 GHz) 
and 3.5f (31.1 GHz) are excited in the ON state.  
The detailed surface current distribution of the proposed cell 
structure is depicted in Fig. 5, where the surface current on the 
patch element is primarily distributed along the edges of 
circular cutouts. The dimensions of the circular cuts play 
critical roles in facilitating the excitation of these two modes. 
The proposed configuration can be compared with the 
simulated patch unit cell in Fig. 6, where only one resonant 3.5f 
mode occurs in the ON state without the circular cutouts. 
Additionally, the RF chokes and PIN switches are designed

under the patch, saving the space near the unit cell boundaries 
for the DC biasing lines. Therefore, all biasing lines can be 
routed on the same layer as the PIN switches without the needs 
of adding other layers for multiple biasing lines. The proposed 
unit cell has wideband performance generated by exciting two 
resonant modes through a single layer with a simpler structure. 
Last, the PIN diodes are placed at the backside of the middle 
ground plane to avoid interference with the patch reflection. 
The circular cuts and the PIN placement achieves a compact 
unit cell size of 0.34λ×0.34λ (3.85×3.85 mm) compared with 
the standard half-wavelength unit cell design. The compact unit 
cell design could accommodate more elements in the same 
physical size, which is beneficial to practical miniaturization 
requirement. 
In practical applications, the incident EM wave direction is 
arbitrary, requiring the RIS design should have angular stability 
to deal with incident waves from different directions. The 
reflection magnitude and phase difference of the proposed 
design for different incident angles are illustrated in Fig. 7. In 
the desired 5G mm-wave band (24.25 to 29.5 GHz), the unit 
cell has a reflection magnitude greater than -2.5 dB, and the 
phase difference can be maintained from 140° to 200° when 
incident wave direction varies between 0° and 30°. 
III. RIS DESIGN AND SIMULATION  
The proposed RIS array is demonstrated in Fig. 8, comprising 
400 unit cells (20×20). As mentioned above, the designed unit 
cell structure provides a sufficient space for the biasing lines to 
extend to the board edges. Twenty connectors (DF40TC(3.0)-
20DS) were soldered onto the two edges of the printed circuit 
board (PCB) to connect the biasing lines to the control circuit 
board behind it. The total array size is 77×77 mm, 
corresponding to 7.1λ×7.1λ, where λ is the free-space 
wavelength at the frequency of 27.5 GHz. With additional 
connectors on the edge of the array, the PCB size is 96×96 mm. 
A detailed full-wave simulation model in High-Frequency 
Simulation Software (HFSS) is depicted in Fig. 9. Each unit 
element of the proposed RIS is configured based on the 
discretized phase distribution calculated through the following

where φon is the unit cell phase value when the PIN switch is 
ON, and φoff is the phase value when the PIN is OFF. These two 
values can be obtained from the HFSS simulated results of the 
proposed unit cell. It should be noted that φon and φoff have 
different values at the entire frequency band, but the difference 
between them is 180°±20°. 
According to the simulated angular stability of the proposed 
RIS, it has decent performance with the incident angle varying 
from -30° to +30°. Therefore, in Fig. 9, the incident wave 
direction is set as -30°, transmitted from a WR-34 standard 20 
dBi gain horn antenna (PE9851B/SF-20) from 22 to 33 GHz. 
The phase distribution of the RIS is configured using (1) and 
(2), with u0 ሺ0,0,1). In the simulation model, the RIS and 
standard horn are settled in two boxes with finite element 
boundary integral (FE-BI) to reduce the computational cost of 
the free space between the horn and the RIS. The simulated 
three-dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of the proposed RIS at 
27.5 GHz is presented in Fig. 10, with a peak gain of 20.9 dBi 
at 0° reflection, validating the reconfigurability of the designed 
RIS. 
The switch control circuit schematics, control circuit PCB, 
and flexible printed circuit (FPC) connectors are illustrated in 
Fig. 11. The RIS array board and control circuits are connected 
though the FPC. The overall RIS is driven by the ESP-
WROOM-32 module, which runs a serial communication port 
for the user interface and computes the array patterns. Attached 
to the controller are 50 8-bit phase registers (74HC595D),

which can multiplex the controller IO and drive the PMOS in 
order to bias the 400 PIN switches. Each PIN diode of a unit 
cell is in series with an LED as visualization of the PIN working 
state for ease of debugging. 
IV. FABRICATION AND MEASUREMENT 
The fabricated prototypes of the proposed RIS array 
configuration, control circuits, and overall RIS design are 
exhibited in Fig. 12. The components of the designed RIS, 
including the PCB array, connectors, FPC, and control circuit 
board are packaged inside the mechanical supports, which are 
3D-printed using a Raise3D Pro2 printer with polylactic acid 
filaments. The control circuits are placed at the back side of the 
package, where the LED arrays demonstrate the ON/OFF state 
of each unit element. The power supply port contains a positive 
voltage (+3 to 5 V) and a ground input, which can be connected 
to a DC power source. Four control ports containing a clock 
signal, memory reset, and input data are driven by the ESP-
WROOM-32 module, which is connected to a computer 
through USB to receive commands. 
The measurement setup of the proposed RIS is depicted in 
Fig. 13. Two horn antennas (PE9851B/SF-20) are utilized as 
the Tx and Rx in practical applications, which connect with an 
Anritsu ME7828A vector network analyzer (VNA). The RIS

could reflect the incident beam to the configured beam direction 
instead of PEC reflection using a specific array pattern. In the 
measurement process, once the Tx horn position is determined, 
the RIS will generate the array pattern according to the 
previously discussed algorithm (1). It should be noted that the 
array has various patterns depending on the distance between 
the Tx horn and RIS operation frequency and the desired beam 
reflection direction. In this measurement, the Tx horn is placed 
at a distance of 20 cm from the RIS, which works in the near 
field of the horn antenna. To measure the reflection beam, we 
move the Rx horn from –80° to 0° with a 10° step while 
maintaining the same distance of 30 cm from the RIS. The 
measured S21 parameter between the Tx and Rx horns 
represents the received signal power level related to the 
normalized gain of the RIS. Two pieces of absorbing material 
are placed at the front and back sides of the RIS measurement 
system to reduce the interference of the behind VNA and 
surrounding setup. The RIS could reflect the incident beam to 
the configured beam direction. When the array pattern is OFF, 
it has a similar reflected beam as a PEC reflection because all 
elements have a constant OFF reflection phase. The comparison 
between simulation and measurement is demonstrated in Fig. 
14, which shows consistency that the measurement agrees well 
with the simulated results. The discrepancy between simulation 
and measurement is resulted from the printed support, control 
circuit, and fabrication and assembly errors of the RIS. It should 
be noted that the measured data are from –80° to 0° because the 
Rx horn overlaps with the Tx horn when the angle is greater 
than 0°. 
Moreover, the comparison of the received signal strength 
level at 0° reflection (30° incidence) between turning ON and 
OFF the RIS pattern is demonstrated in Fig. 15. A significant 
improvement from –37.3 to –12.6 dB (24.7 dB enhancement) is 
observed at the center operation frequency of 27.5 GHz when 
the RIS pattern turns on compared with the OFF state. An 
average of 21.2 dB enhancement is obtained for the 5G mm-
wave n257 and n258 frequency bands. It should be pointed out 
that each frequency point has its unique RIS pattern to achieve 
the optimum reflection performance. The RIS pattern in Fig. 15 
is optimized for the 27.5 GHz frequency, where a peak gain is 
observed over the whole frequency range. 
Detailed measurement procedures and results are discussed 
as follows. First, to validate the practical wideband 
performance of the proposed RIS design, the same 
measurements at different frequencies were conducted, as 
demonstrated in Fig. 16(a). Specifically, the incident wave and 
desired reflected wave directions were fixed. As discussed in 
the simulation section, the proposed RIS has angular stability 
with –30° to 30°. Thus, the Tx horn position is fixed, and the 
incidence angle is maintained at 30°, whereas the desired 
reflected beam direction is set to 0°. The measured setup 
remains the same, but working frequencies changed from 22.5 
to 29.5 GHz with a 1 GHz step that each frequency point has a 
specific array pattern to reflect the 30° incident wave to 0°. 
The measured signal strength of the desired beam direction 
(0° reflection) over a wide frequency range from 22.5 to 29.5 
GHz is captured as demonstrated in Fig. 17. The measured S21 
parameter between the Tx and Rx horns changed from –12.5 to 
–14.7 dB within the whole measured frequency band. In other 
words, the proposed RIS design possesses a 3 dB peak gain 
bandwidth of over 26.9% which can fulfill the 5G mm-wave 
n257 and n258 bands requirements. 
The detailed received signal level comparison of the RIS and 
PEC reflections is presented in Fig. 18(a–h). The array phase 
distribution (i.e., ON/OFF state of the PIN switches) at different 
operation frequencies is provided at the upper right corner of 
each figure. Uniform and consistent results were obtained 
within the whole frequency band from 22.5 to 29.5 GHz

(26.9%), which proves its wideband reconfigurability. The 
measured side lobe level (SLL) values for the proposed RIS 
design are 7.9, 8.1, 4.7, 6.3, 7.1, 9.1, 8.4 and 8.7 dB for 
frequencies from 22.5 to 29.5 GHz. Therefore, an average of 
7.5 dB for the SLL is obtained over the whole frequency range. 
The reason that the SLL at frequencies around 24.5 and 25.5 
GHz is lower than at other frequencies is that the unit cell has a 
deteriorated phase difference (140°) at an incident angle of 30° 
(Fig. 7). Nevertheless, such a measurement proves that the 
proposed RIS design has wideband performance that could 
cover the 5G mm-wave n257 and n258 bands. 
Furthermore, another experiment on the beam scanning 
capability of the proposed design was also conducted. The 
detailed measured scheme is demonstrated in Fig. 16(b). In this 
case, the feed source location is the same as the previous 
experiment with the incident wave direction of 30°. In addition, 
the operation frequency is fixed at 27.5 GHz. However, this 
time, the desired beam reflection direction is changed from 0° 
to 50° to validate the beam scanning performance of the 
designed RIS. Therefore, the array pattern changes accordingly 
when with various reflected wave directions.  
The measured S21 values between the Tx and Rx horns at 
different reflected beam directions from 0° to 50° are presented 
in Fig. 19(a–f). The maximum reflected beam direction moves 
from the original 0° to 50° when varying the pattern 
configuration. The measured S21 parameters between two horns 
for the desired beam reflection direction from 0° to 50° are 
–12.5, –12.8, –11.7, –11.3, –11.9, and –14.5 dB. Moreover, the 
SLL values for reflection angles from 0° to 50° are 9.1, 7.6, 
11.3, 16.5, 12.9, and 5.8 dB. Thus, the proposed RIS design

could demonstrate a beam steering capability of up to 50°.  
The above-conducted measurements are the near-field tests, 
where the Tx horn is 20 cm away from the RIS. Therefore, the 
incident wave impinging on the RIS is a spherical wave. To 
validate the RIS performance in the far-field region, the Tx horn 
should be placed at a position that ensures the illumination on 
the RIS is a plane wave. In this experiment, the horn antenna 
(PE9851B/SF-20) has an aperture of 3.47×4.7 cm, so the far-
field distance should be 2D2/λ = 62.6 cm, where λ is the 
wavelength at 27.5 GHz. Hence, the Tx horn is moved to a 
distance of 70 cm to implement the far-field test, whereas the 
Rx horn is kept 30 cm from the RIS to maintain a relatively high 
received signal power level. The measurement setup has the 
same configuration as the near-field test in that the incident 
wave angle is 30°, and the desired reflection beam direction is 
0°, which is achieved by controlling the RIS pattern (Fig. 
16(a)).  
The measured transmission between the Tx and Rx horns, 
when the RIS pattern is ON or OFF, is depicted in Fig. 20. The 
signal is enhanced substantially, and an average of 19.6 dB 
(from –42.6 to –23 dB) is obtained over the entire n257 and 
n258 bands. Although the signal enhancement has a 5.1 dB 
reduction compared with the near-field test, it is reasonable due 
to the higher path loss and less effective received area of the 
RIS compared with the horn placed in the near field. 
Nevertheless, the far-field test proved that the proposed RIS 
design could realize decent signal enhancement with a large 
bandwidth over the entire interested 5G bands. To compare the 
proposed work with previous practical RIS designs, the features 
of this work are summarized in Table Ⅰ. Most RISs have a 
narrow bandwidth of less than 14% [11], [13], [14], [17]. As 
discussed, the previously published literature has primarily 
focused on the sub-6 band [11], [13], [14]. The work proposed 
in [17] aimed at a 5G mm-wave design, but the bandwidth is 
7.3%, which cannot cover the entire 5G n257 and n258 
bandwidths. In this work, the proposed design with a measured 
26.9% bandwidth is the highest for the RIS operating at the 5G 
mm-wave band.  
V. CONCLUSION 
In this work, we designed a novel wideband RIS operating in 
the 5G mm-wave band, and the unit cell has a bandwidth of 
29.3% (22.7 to 30.5 GHz). Wideband performance is realized 
by the two high-order resonances with 2.5f and 3.5f operation 
frequencies, which demonstrates a decent unit cell performance 
with incident angular stability of ±30°. A final RIS design with 
a 20×20 array configuration is fabricated and measured with a 
total size of 7.1λ×7.1λ revealing a 3 dB gain bandwidth of 
26.9% (covering the whole 5G mm-wave n257 and n258 
bands). The design can scan a reflection beam of up to 50°. 
Therefore, the proposed RIS design with wideband reflection
