Abstract: The random distribution of a complex joint network within a coal–rock mass has a signiﬁ-
cant weakening effect on its bearing capacity, making the surrounding rock of the roadway highly
susceptible to instability and failure under the inﬂuence of in situ stress and mining-induced stress.
This poses challenges in controlling the surrounding rock and seriously affects the normal production
of mines. Consequently, it is imperative to conduct stability analysis on complex jointed roadway
surrounding rock. Therefore, taking the transport roadway of Panel 11030 in the Zhaogu No. 2 Coal
Mine as a case study, the microscopic contact parameters of particles and joint surfaces in each rock
layer were calibrated through uniaxial compression and shear simulation tests using the particle
ﬂow simulation software PFC2D 5.0. Based on the calibrated microscopic contact parameters, a
multilayered roadway surrounding rock model containing complex joints was established, and the
joint density was quantiﬁed to analyze its effects on the displacement ﬁeld, stress ﬁeld, force chain
ﬁeld, and energy ﬁeld of the roadway surrounding rock. The research ﬁndings indicate that as the
distance to the sidewall decreases, the impact of joint density on the deformation of the surrounding
rock of the roadway increases. The displacement of the roadway roof, ﬂoor, and sidewalls is affected
differently by the joint density, predominantly contingent upon the properties of the rock mass.
During the process of stress redistribution in the surrounding rock, the vertical stress of the roof
and ﬂoor is released more intensively compared to the horizontal stress, while the horizontal stress
of the sidewalls is released more intensively compared to the vertical stress. The increase in joint
density leads to an increasing release rate of the surrounding rock stress, causing the load-bearing
rock mass to transfer towards the deeper part. As the joint density increases, the force chain network
gradually transitions from dense to sparse, resulting in a decrease in strong force chains and a decline
in the bearing capacity of the surrounding rock, accompanied by an expansion in the range of force
chain failure and deformation. With the continuous increase in joint density, the values of maximum
released kinetic energy and residual released kinetic energy become larger. Once the joint density
reaches a certain threshold, the kinetic energy stability zone consistently maintains a high energy
level, indicating extreme instability in the roadway and sustained deformation. The results provide a
valuable insight for analyzing the failure mechanism of complex jointed roadway surrounding rock
and implementing corresponding support measures.

1. Introduction
A coal–rock mass is inﬂuenced by long-term tectonic activities, resulting in the ran-
dom distribution of various defects such as structural planes and fractures with different

characteristics. The presence of these defects gives rise to a complex joint network, which
signiﬁcantly impairs the bearing capacity of the coal–rock mass [1–3]. As a result, the
roadway surrounding rock is prone to instability and failure under the inﬂuence of in situ
stress and mining-induced stress; this poses difﬁculties in the stability analysis, support
design, and control of the surrounding rock, seriously affecting the normal production of
mines [4–6]. Hence, undertaking stability analysis of complex jointed roadway surrounding
rock holds tremendous theoretical signiﬁcance and engineering value.
Investigations into the mechanical properties of jointed rock masses, serving as the
basis for the stability analysis of complex jointed roadways, have been extensively pursued
by scholars. Their research has demonstrated the profound inﬂuence of joints on the stabil-
ity of roadway surrounding rock. Cao et al. [7] analyzed the mechanical characteristics and
failure behavior of rock masses with different intersecting joint angles through combined
physical experiments and numerical simulations, summarizing four different failure modes.
Yang et al. [8] investigated the inﬂuence of joint angles, joint spacing, and joint overlap on
the strength and failure modes of rock specimens, revealing that the joint angle had the
most signiﬁcant effect on the failure mode. Liu et al. [9] analyzed the fatigue fracturing
characteristics of discontinuous jointed rock masses under cyclic loading conditions and
compared them with static loading tests, revealing a more abrupt failure of specimens
under the former conditions. Dou et al. [10] analyzed the inﬂuence of joint dip angle on
the mechanical and energy characteristics of sandstone specimens and analyzed the failure
shapes at different fracture interfaces using scanning electron microscopy. In summary,
scholars have achieved numerous results in the study of the mechanical characteristics
of jointed rock masses, laying a foundation for the stability analysis of complex jointed
roadway surrounding rock.
Based on the aforementioned observations, scholars have conducted experimental
and simulation analysis on complex jointed roadway surrounding rock [11–13]. Regarding
physical experiments, Yang et al. [14] analyzed the mechanical characteristics and crack
propagation behavior of specimens with cavities under different joint dip angle conditions
to investigate the inﬂuence of joints on roadway stability, and they found that a dip angle
of 90◦ had the least impact. Wang et al. [15] comprehensively examined the effects of
roadway shape and fault dip angle on roadway damage, studying the initiation position
and propagation path of cracks under the respective inﬂuences. Guo et al. [16] analyzed
the deformation evolution process of layered jointed roadway surrounding rock models
and found that the distribution of stress concentration zones in the surrounding rock is
highly uneven due to the unique characteristics of layered joint structures.
However, indoor experiments possess inherent limitations, as they can only examine
small-scale models of jointed roadway surrounding rock., Additionally, the restrictions
imposed by the fabrication methods of joints, where the models have regular joint ar-
rangements and a small number of joints, there are signiﬁcant differences compared to
actual engineering sites. Therefore, scholars have conducted numerical simulation analysis.
Huang et al. [17] explored the inﬂuence of the position, dip angle, and thickness of weak
interlayers on roadway stability and analyzed the relationship between the damaged zone
and the aforementioned parameters based on simulation results, providing references for
roadway support design. Li et al. [18] compared and analyzed the deformation of jointed
roadway surrounding rock under different stress conditions. Xiong and Tao [19,20] both
studied the stability of inclined coal–rock layer roadway surrounding rock and proposed
corresponding support schemes by analyzing the deformation and failure of the roof, ﬂoor,
and sidewalls. Lin et al. [21] examined the inﬂuence of the orientation, dip angle, and
spacing of joints in a three-dimensional state on the stability of surrounding rock, providing
references for the stability assessment and support optimization of roadway surrounding
rock. He et al. [22] improved the discontinuous deformation analysis method to better
simulate the deformation and failure process of jointed roadway surrounding rock, and the
simulation results showed good agreement with actual engineering. In summary, scholars
have employed a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to

elucidate the unstable deformation process of jointed roadway surrounding rock from
perspectives such as stress ﬁeld, displacement ﬁeld, and crack ﬁeld. They have proposed
corresponding support schemes based on the working conditions. However, most of the
objects are roadway surrounding rock models with dominant joint surfaces, regular joint
arrangements, and different joint angles, without considering the inﬂuence of complex
joint networks on the strength and deformation of the surrounding rock. Therefore, it
is imperative to ﬁgure out the inﬂuence of complex joints on the stability of roadway
surrounding rock.
Based on this, this study takes the transport roadway of Panel 11030 in the Zhaogu
No. 2 Coal Mine as a case study. With the assistance of the particle ﬂow software PFC2D,
a multilayered roadway surrounding rock model with complex joints is established, and
the quantity of complex joints is quantiﬁed based on joint density. The inﬂuence of joint
density on the displacement ﬁeld, stress ﬁeld, force chain ﬁeld, and other aspects of the
roadway surrounding rock under corresponding stress conditions is analyzed, elucidating
the effect of joint density on the stability of complex jointed roadway surrounding rock.

the Roadway 
In PFC (Particle Flow Code), the physical and mechanical behavior of materials is 
simulated through the contact constitutive relationship between particles. The microme-
chanical parameters between particles directly aﬀect the macroscopic mechanical re-
sponse of the material. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the micromechanical contact 
parameters between particles repeatedly to make the mechanical characteristics of the ma-
terial simulated by the model close to the actual material. 
Before establishing the numerical model of the roadway surrounding rock using the 
PFC2D, this study ﬁrst calibrated the micromechanical parameters and contact parame-
ters of the particles based on the mechanical properties of each coal and rock strata of the 
roadway surrounding rock. Uniaxial compression simulation tests were conducted on 
standard rock specimens from each coal and rock strata. The micromechanical contact pa-
rameters between particles were adjusted through a trial-and-error method to obtain re-
sults that were consistent with indoor physical mechanical tests. Figures 3 and 4 show the 
comparison between some stress–strain curves obtained from indoor tests and numerical 
simulation results. Tables 1 and 2 present the adjusted micromechanical parameters of the

Using the Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) to characterize rock joint surfaces, the 
DFN is embedded in the bonded particle model, and corresponding contact models and 
contact parameters between the DFN and model particles are assigned to represent the 
mechanical properties of rock joint surfaces. The contact model at the joint surface adopts 
a smooth joint model, and a shear model with a planar joint surface is established based 
on the particle micro-contact parameters calibrated in Section 3.1. Shear simulation tests 
are conducted with normal stresses of 1 MPa, 2 MPa, 3 MPa, 4 MPa, and 5 MPa to calibrate 
the micro-parameters of the joint surface [24]. The experimental model is shown in Figure 
5. The friction angles of the joint surfaces in the basic roof sandy mudstone, immediate 
roof mudstone, coal seam, and ﬂoor sandy mudstone are 40°, 35°, 31°, and 37°, respec-
tively [23]. Figures 6–9 represent the simulation results of direct shear tests on diﬀerent 
coal–rock layers. It can be observed that as the normal stress increases, the peak shear 
force increases, and the diﬀerence between the simulated and actual friction angles of the 
structural plane is small. The micro-contact parameters of the simulated structural plane 
can be used for subsequent research. The calibrated micro-contact parameters of the joint 
surface are shown in Table 3.

conducted with normal stresses of 1 MPa, 2 MPa, 3 MPa, 4 MPa, and 5 MPa to calibrate the
micro-parameters of the joint surface [24]. The experimental model is shown in Figure 5.
The friction angles of the joint surfaces in the basic roof sandy mudstone, immediate roof

3.3. Construction of Complex Jointed Roadway Surrounding Rock Model
As mentioned above, based on the calibrated particle micro-parameters and contact
parameters described earlier, a numerical model of the roadway was established. The
overall dimensions of the model were designed as 30 m × 35.95 m (width × height), and
the dimensions of the rectangular roadway were prefabricated according to the actual size
of 4.8 m × 3.3 m (width × height). The model was subjected to the original rock stress ﬁeld

(vertical stress of 15 MPa and horizontal stress of 12 MPa) using a servo mechanism, and
the roadway was simulated for excavation.
The speciﬁc steps for establishing the excavation model of the roadway are as follows:
Based on the particle and joint contact micro-parameters calibrated from the previous
uniaxial compression tests and direct shear tests on joint surfaces, an intact rock model
before excavation was constructed. Before excavation, the bottom wall was ﬁxed, and then
the upper wall and boundary walls were subjected to corresponding vertical and horizontal
stresses through the servo program, allowing the model to achieve equilibrium under the
inﬂuence of gravity and external forces, establishing the initial stress ﬁeld of the original
rock. Once the model reached initial equilibrium, the roadway was excavated using the
DEL command. The complete roadway surrounding rock model after excavation and the
roadway surrounding rock model with complex joints are shown in Figures 10 and 11,

To investigate the inﬂuence of joint density on the stability of roadway surrounding 
rock, joint density εf (the length of joint traces per unit area) was set to 0 m/m−2 (intact), 0.2 
m/m−2, 0.4 m/m−2, 0.6 m/m−2, 0.8 m/m−2, and 1.0 m/m−2. For each level of complex joint road-
way surrounding rock model, 15 samples were taken, and the average values of displace-
ment and stress changes in the roadway surrounding rock were calculated as representa-
tive values for each joint density. The joint dip angles and positions were uniformly dis-
tributed, with a dip angle range of 0° to 180° and a joint trace length range of 0 m to 1.5 m.

By setting measuring lines on the roof, ﬂoor, and sidewalls, diﬀerent numbers of 
measuring circles were placed on each measuring line to monitor the stress changes in the 
roadway surrounding rock in real time. This allowed for the analysis of the variation pat-
terns of roadway surrounding rock stress with respect to joint density. For the models 
with joint densities εf = 0 to 0.4 m/m−2, 0.6 m/m−2, and 0.8 to 1.0 m/m−2, the measuring circles 
were located at distances of 0.4 to 6.0 m, 0.4 to 8.4 m, and 0.4 to 11.6 m from the roadway 
edge, respectively. The adjacent measuring circles had center-to-center intervals of 0.4 m, 
0.6 m, and 0.8 m. The arrangement of measuring circles is shown in Figure 12. Since the 
measured stress of the measuring circles represents the average contact stress of the par-
ticles within the circle, a measuring circle radius of 0.4 m was chosen to ensure the accu-
racy of the measured stress and to avoid a measurement range that was too large to reﬂect 
the speciﬁc stress conditions of the surrounding rock at that location. 
4.1. Analysis of Displacement Field Variation 
By writing FISH language, particle displacements within a speciﬁed range were ex-

represents the deformation of the surrounding rock at the central position within the spec-
iﬁed range. Figure 13 illustrates the inﬂuence trend of joint density on the displacement 
ﬁeld of roadway surrounding rock at the same depth from the sidewall. Through analysis, 
the following conclusions can be drawn:

By setting measuring lines on the roof, ﬂoor, and sidewalls, different numbers of
measuring circles were placed on each measuring line to monitor the stress changes in
the roadway surrounding rock in real time. This allowed for the analysis of the variation
patterns of roadway surrounding rock stress with respect to joint density. For the models
with joint densities εf = 0 to 0.4 m/m−2, 0.6 m/m−2, and 0.8 to 1.0 m/m−2, the measuring
circles were located at distances of 0.4 to 6.0 m, 0.4 to 8.4 m, and 0.4 to 11.6 m from the
roadway edge, respectively. The adjacent measuring circles had center-to-center intervals
of 0.4 m, 0.6 m, and 0.8 m. The arrangement of measuring circles is shown in Figure 12.
Since the measured stress of the measuring circles represents the average contact stress of
the particles within the circle, a measuring circle radius of 0.4 m was chosen to ensure the
accuracy of the measured stress and to avoid a measurement range that was too large to
reﬂect the speciﬁc stress conditions of the surrounding rock at that location.
4.1. Analysis of Displacement Field Variation
By writing FISH language, particle displacements within a speciﬁed range were
exported and their average displacement was calculated. This average displacement
value represents the deformation of the surrounding rock at the central position within the
speciﬁed range. Figure 13 illustrates the inﬂuence trend of joint density on the displacement
ﬁeld of roadway surrounding rock at the same depth from the sidewall. Through analysis,
the following conclusions can be drawn:
(1)
With the location closer to the roadway sidewall, the impact of joint density on the
deformation of the roadway surrounding rock becomes greater. The displacement
values of the roadway roof, ﬂoor, and sidewalls are affected differently by joint density.
From Figure 13c, it can be observed that as the joint density εf increases from 0 m/m−2
to 0.2 m/m−2, signiﬁcant deformation ﬁrst occurs in the sidewall of the roadway. The
maximum displacement value of the right sidewall increases from 3 mm to 50 mm,
an increase of 47 mm. From Figure 13b, it can be seen that when the joint density εf
Sustainability 2023, 15, 13561
10 of 19
increases to 0.4 m/m−2, signiﬁcant deformation subsequently occurs in the ﬂoor, with
the maximum ﬂoor heave increasing to 46 mm. When the joint density εf increases
to 1.0 m/m−2, the maximum displacements of the left and right sidewalls, roof, and
ﬂoor reach 247 mm, 380 mm, 124 mm, and 234 mm, respectively. The convergence
of the left and right sidewalls is 627 mm, and the convergence of the roof and ﬂoor
is 358 mm. The analysis reveals the following reasons: as the roadway is excavated
along the roof, both sidewalls and the ﬂoor consist of relatively weak coal layers,
while the roof consists of mudstone and sandy mudstone. Therefore, the sidewalls
and ﬂoor are the ﬁrst to undergo signiﬁcant deformation due to the inﬂuence of joint
density, followed by the roof.
(2)
As the joint density increases, the main areas of deformation in the roadway sur-
rounding rock extend from the shallow rock mass to the deep rock mass. Taking
the deformation of the roadway sidewall as an example, from Figure 13c,d, it can
be observed that when the joint density εf increases from 0 m/m−2 to 0.4 m/m−2,
the main deformation of the right sidewall occurs at the 0–1.0 m range, while the
main deformation of the left sidewall occurs at the 0–1.5 m range. When the joint
density εf increases to 0.6 m/m−2, deformation of the surrounding rock starts at a
distance of 2.0 m from the right sidewall, and the convergence of the right sidewall
increases to 51 mm. When the joint density εf increases to 0.8 m/m−2, deformation
of the surrounding rock begins at a distance of 2.0 m from the left sidewall, and the
convergence increases to 31 mm. When the joint density εf increases to 1.0 m/m−2, the
convergence of the surrounding rock from both sidewalls reaches 78 mm and 72 mm
at a distance of 2.0 m from the sidewalls. It can be observed that the increase in joint
density leads to a decrease in the overall bearing capacity of the roadway surrounding
rock. Shallow rock mass deformation and damage are severe, and the load-bearing
rock mass gradually transfers towards the surrounding rock.
Figure 14 illustrates the comprehensive displacement nephogram of the surrounding
rock models with different joint densities after excavation of the roadway. By adjusting the
range of particle displacements to analyze the inﬂuence of joint density on the displacement
ﬁeld, it can be observed from the ﬁgure that as the joint density continues to increase, the
deformation range of the surrounding rock becomes larger, and the inﬂuence of joint density
on the displacement ﬁeld of the roadway surrounding rock becomes more signiﬁcant. When
the joint density εf increases from 0 m/m−2 to 1.0 m/m−2, under the combined effects of
overlying strata pressure and joint-induced rock degradation, the deformation range of
the roof surrounding rock signiﬁcantly increases. At the same time, the surrounding rock
gradually experiences rock loosening and detachment, leading to a sudden increase in local
displacement and deformation.
4.2. Analysis of Stress Field Variation
In order to analyze the stress variation at different depths of the roadway surrounding
rock more clearly, the stress release ratio λ [25] is introduced:
λ = σm − σn
σm
(1)
where σm is the stress before excavation in MPa, and σn is the stress after excavation
stabilization in MPa.
By detecting the stress state of each measuring circle, the stress release ratio at various
positions near the surrounding rock after roadway excavation is calculated. Figure 15
shows the relationship between the stress release ratio of the roadway surrounding rock
and the distance from the sidewall when the joint density εf is 0.6 m/m−2. In the ﬁgure, λ
is positive when the stress decreases, and λ is negative when the stress increases.

(1) With the location closer to the roadway sidewall, the impact of joint density 
deformation of the roadway surrounding rock becomes greater. The displac
values of the roadway roof, ﬂoor, and sidewalls are aﬀected diﬀerently by join
sity. From Figure 13c, it can be observed that as the joint density εf increases 
m/m−2 to 0.2 m/m−2, signiﬁcant deformation ﬁrst occurs in the sidewall of the
way. The maximum displacement value of the right sidewall increases from 3 
50 mm, an increase of 47 mm. From Figure 13b, it can be seen that when th
density εf increases to 0.4 m/m−2, signiﬁcant deformation subsequently occurs
ﬂoor, with the maximum ﬂoor heave increasing to 46 mm. When the joint den
increases to 1.0 m/m−2, the maximum displacements of the left and right side
roof, and ﬂoor reach 247 mm, 380 mm, 124 mm, and 234 mm, respectively. Th
vergence of the left and right sidewalls is 627 mm, and the convergence of th
and ﬂoor is 358 mm. The analysis reveals the following reasons: as the road
excavated along the roof, both sidewalls and the ﬂoor consist of relatively wea
layers, while the roof consists of mudstone and sandy mudstone. Therefore, th
walls and ﬂoor are the ﬁrst to undergo signiﬁcant deformation due to the inﬂ
of joint density, followed by the roof. 
(2) As the joint density increases, the main areas of deformation in the roadwa
rounding rock extend from the shallow rock mass to the deep rock mass. Taki
deformation of the roadway sidewall as an example, from Figure 13c,d, it can 
served that when the joint density εf increases from 0 m/m−2 to 0.4 m/m−2, the

of joint density on ﬂoor at the same distance; (c) the inﬂuence curve of joint density on the right
sidewall convergence at the same distance; (d) the inﬂuence curve of joint density on the left sidewall
convergence at the same distance.
From Figure 15, the following can be observed:
(1)
During the process of stress redistribution in the roadway surrounding rock, the
vertical stress of the roof and ﬂoor is released more signiﬁcantly compared to the hori-
zontal stress, while the horizontal stress of the sidewalls is released more signiﬁcantly
compared to the vertical stress. With the distance closer to the sidewall, the stress
release ratio of the surrounding rock becomes greater. Taking the stress of the roof and
ﬂoor surrounding rock as an example, when the distance from the sidewall is 1.0 m,
the vertical stress release rate of the roof and ﬂoor are 92% and 98%, respectively,
and the horizontal stress release rate are 42% and 46%; when the distance from the
sidewall is 5.2 m, the vertical stress release rate of the roof and ﬂoor are 44% and 59%,
respectively, and the horizontal stress release rate are −18% and −6%. It can be seen
that with the increasing depth from the sidewall, the vertical stress of the roof remains
in a release state, while the roof and ﬂoor show a zone of increased horizontal stress.
(2)
The horizontal stress of the roof and ﬂoor, as well as the vertical stress and horizontal
stress of the sidewalls, gradually change from positive values to negative values,
indicating a continuous zone of stress increase for the horizontal stress of the roof, the
vertical stress of the sidewalls, and the horizontal stress of the sidewalls with increas-
ing depth from the sidewall. When the distance from the sidewall is approximately
1.6 m, both sidewalls show a zone of increased vertical stress, with stress release
ratios reaching −3.7% and −12.1%, respectively. When the distance from the sidewall
is approximately 4 m, the surrounding rock shows a zone of increased horizontal

rock models with diﬀerent joint densities after excavation of the roadway. By adjusting 
the range of particle displacements to analyze the inﬂuence of joint density on the dis-
placement ﬁeld, it can be observed from the ﬁgure that as the joint density continues to 
increase, the deformation range of the surrounding rock becomes larger, and the inﬂuence 
of joint density on the displacement ﬁeld of the roadway surrounding rock becomes more 
signiﬁcant. When the joint density εf increases from 0 m/m−2 to 1.0 m/m−2, under the com-
bined eﬀects of overlying strata pressure and joint-induced rock degradation, the defor-
mation range of the roof surrounding rock signiﬁcantly increases. At the same time, the 
surrounding rock gradually experiences rock loosening and detachment, leading to a sud-
den increase in local displacement and deformation.

ﬁgure, it can be observed that the increase in joint density results in a decrease in the overall
bearing capacity of the surrounding rock. The vertical stress release rate of the roof and
ﬂoor and the horizontal stress release rate of the sidewalls show a continuous increasing

trend. When the joint density increases from 0 m/m−2 to 1.0 m/m−2, the vertical stress
release rate of the roof and ﬂoor increases from 63% and 65% to 78% and 92%, respectively,
while the sidewalls change from the zone of stress increase to the zone of stress release,
with an increase from −8% and −15% to 35% and 60%, respectively. It can be seen that
with the continuous increase in joint density, the stress release rate of the surrounding rock
keeps increasing, and the bearing rock mass of the roadway surrounding rock is transferred
to deeper regions.
In order to explore the variation in stress release rate with increasing joint d
the vertical stress of the roof and ﬂoor and the horizontal stress of the sidewalls
same location were monitored. Figure 16a represents the variation in stress release 
the surrounding rock with joint density at a distance of 2.8 m from the sidewall. Fro
ﬁgure, it can be observed that the increase in joint density results in a decrease in the
all bearing capacity of the surrounding rock. The vertical stress release rate of the ro
ﬂoor and the horizontal stress release rate of the sidewalls show a continuous incr
trend. When the joint density increases from 0 m/m−2 to 1.0 m/m−2, the vertical str
lease rate of the roof and ﬂoor increases from 63% and 65% to 78% and 92%, respec
while the sidewalls change from the zone of stress increase to the zone of stress r
with an increase from −8% and −15% to 35% and 60%, respectively. It can be seen tha
the continuous increase in joint density, the stress release rate of the surroundin
keeps increasing, and the bearing rock mass of the roadway surrounding rock is
ferred to deeper regions.

By monitoring the horizontal stress of the roof and ﬂoor and the vertical stress
sidewalls through measuring circles, the inﬂuence of joint density on the initial po
of the stress increase zone is analyzed. As shown in Figure 16b, joint density signiﬁ
aﬀects the initial position of the stress increase zone of the horizontal stress of the ro
ﬂoor and the vertical stress of the sidewalls. With the increase in joint density, the
increase zone gradually shifts towards the deeper rock mass. When the joint den
increases from 0 m/m−2 to 1.0 m/m−2, the stress increase zone of the horizontal stress
roof and ﬂoor extends from a distance of 1.6 m from the roadway wall to 3.65 m an
m from the roadway wall, respectively, and the vertical stress increase zone of th
walls extends from distances of 0.8 m and 0.4 m from the roadway wall to 3.12 m an
m from the roadway wall, respectively. In conclusion, with the increase in joint d
the decrease in the bearing capacity of the surrounding rock requires deeper rock m

In PFC (Particle Flow Code), force chains serve as pathways for stress transm
and possess certain bearing characteristics [26]. During the process of roadway e
tion, it is inevitable that the force chain of the surrounding rock will undergo adjust
and changes. By analyzing the distribution morphology of the force chain in the surr

By monitoring the horizontal stress of the roof and ﬂoor and the vertical stress of the
sidewalls through measuring circles, the inﬂuence of joint density on the initial position
of the stress increase zone is analyzed. As shown in Figure 16b, joint density signiﬁcantly
affects the initial position of the stress increase zone of the horizontal stress of the roof and
ﬂoor and the vertical stress of the sidewalls. With the increase in joint density, the stress
increase zone gradually shifts towards the deeper rock mass. When the joint density εf
increases from 0 m/m−2 to 1.0 m/m−2, the stress increase zone of the horizontal stress of
the roof and ﬂoor extends from a distance of 1.6 m from the roadway wall to 3.65 m and
5.12 m from the roadway wall, respectively, and the vertical stress increase zone of the
sidewalls extends from distances of 0.8 m and 0.4 m from the roadway wall to 3.12 m and
3.32 m from the roadway wall, respectively. In conclusion, with the increase in joint density,
the decrease in the bearing capacity of the surrounding rock requires deeper rock mass to
support its stability.
4.3. Analysis of Force Chain Field Variation
In PFC (Particle Flow Code), force chains serve as pathways for stress transmission
and possess certain bearing characteristics [26]. During the process of roadway excavation,
it is inevitable that the force chain of the surrounding rock will undergo adjustments and
changes. By analyzing the distribution morphology of the force chain in the surrounding
rock with joint density εf = 0.6 m/m−2, the evolutionary characteristics of the force chain in
the surrounding rock are studied. The evolutionary characteristics of the surrounding rock
force chain at different time steps after roadway excavation are shown in Figure 17. With
thicker force chains and darker colors, the contact force between particles increases; with
thinner force chains and lighter colors, the contact force between particles decreases.

Figure 17. Evolution characteristics of force chain after roadway excavation: (a) time step = 0 s; (b) 
time step = 0.061 s; (c) time step = 0.123 s. 
From Figure 17a, it can be observed that in the original state of rock stress (time step 
= 0 s), the overall surrounding rock is inﬂuenced by both vertical and horizontal stresses, 
and the distribution of contact forces is crisscrossed, with a relatively uniform distribution 
of force chain. After the excavation of the roadway (time step > 0), the equilibrium state of 
the surrounding rock stress is disrupted, and the rock particles undergo movement and 
deformation, causing changes in the network of force chains. The force chain around the 
sidewall fractures, and the roof, ﬂoor, and sidewalls deform. At time step 0.061 s, the force 
chain network gradually evolves into an arch-shaped force chain, as shown in Figure 17b. 
The strong force chain zone in the upper horizontal direction of the roof has transformed 
into a distinctively directional arch-shaped strong force chain, supporting the load of the 
upper rock layers. At time step 0.123 s, as shown in Figure 17c, the stress state of the sur-
rounding rock has reached a new equilibrium. Due to the weaker rock strata in the coal 
seam, the range of force chain fractures in the sidewalls and ﬂoor is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent 
from that of the roof. At this time, the entire surrounding rock of the roadway is enveloped 
within a strong force chain arch. 
To investigate the inﬂuence of joint density on the force chain ﬁeld of the surrounding 
rock after roadway excavation, the distribution morphology of force chain in the sur-
rounding rock of the roadway under diﬀerent joint densities was obtained, as shown in 
Figure 18. From the ﬁgure, it can be observed that the presence of joints weakens the over-
all bearing capacity of the surrounding rock. With the increase in joint density, the distri-
bution of force chain networks gradually transitions from dense to sparse, and the strong 
force chain networks decrease. As a result, the overall bearing capacity of the surrounding 
rock decreases, and the range of force chain damage and deformation in the sidewalls 
increases. The inﬂuence of joint density on the failure depth of force chain is analyzed by 
calculating the distance between roadway wall and strong force chain arch. When the joint 
density εf = 0 m/m−2, the roof and ﬂoor of the surrounding rock experience damage, with 
force chain damage depths of 2.1 m and 2.8 m, respectively, which is equal to the thickness 
of the immediate roof mudstone and immediate ﬂoor coal seam. The sidewalls, as the 
main load-bearing zone of the surrounding rock, experience stress concentration. When 
the joint density εf = 0.8 m/m−2, the strong force chain network, which plays a major load-
bearing role in the roadway surrounding rock, signiﬁcantly decreases. The damage to the 
force chain network in the roof and ﬂoor intensiﬁes, and the force chain deformation in 
the sidewalls becomes evident, with the damage depths of the left and right sidewalls 
being 2.25 m and 1.92 m, respectively. When the joint density increases to 1.0 m/m−2, the 
degree of damage to the force chain network in the surrounding rock further intensiﬁes. 
The uneven distribution of joints in the sidewalls leads to severe deformation in the right 
sidewall, with the force chain damage depth increasing from 2.25 m to 3.3 m, while the

step = 0 s), the overall surrounding rock is inﬂuenced by both vertical and horizontal
stresses, and the distribution of contact forces is crisscrossed, with a relatively uniform

movement and deformation, causing changes in the network of force chains. The force
chain around the sidewall fractures, and the roof, ﬂoor, and sidewalls deform. At time
step 0.061 s, the force chain network gradually evolves into an arch-shaped force chain,
as shown in Figure 17b. The strong force chain zone in the upper horizontal direction of
the roof has transformed into a distinctively directional arch-shaped strong force chain,
supporting the load of the upper rock layers. At time step 0.123 s, as shown in Figure 17c,
the stress state of the surrounding rock has reached a new equilibrium. Due to the weaker
rock strata in the coal seam, the range of force chain fractures in the sidewalls and ﬂoor is
signiﬁcantly different from that of the roof. At this time, the entire surrounding rock of the
roadway is enveloped within a strong force chain arch.
To investigate the inﬂuence of joint density on the force chain ﬁeld of the surrounding
rock after roadway excavation, the distribution morphology of force chain in the surround-
ing rock of the roadway under different joint densities was obtained, as shown in Figure 18.
From the ﬁgure, it can be observed that the presence of joints weakens the overall bearing
capacity of the surrounding rock. With the increase in joint density, the distribution of
force chain networks gradually transitions from dense to sparse, and the strong force
chain networks decrease. As a result, the overall bearing capacity of the surrounding rock
decreases, and the range of force chain damage and deformation in the sidewalls increases.
The inﬂuence of joint density on the failure depth of force chain is analyzed by calculating
the distance between roadway wall and strong force chain arch. When the joint density
εf = 0 m/m−2, the roof and ﬂoor of the surrounding rock experience damage, with force
chain damage depths of 2.1 m and 2.8 m, respectively, which is equal to the thickness
of the immediate roof mudstone and immediate ﬂoor coal seam. The sidewalls, as the
main load-bearing zone of the surrounding rock, experience stress concentration. When
the joint density εf = 0.8 m/m−2, the strong force chain network, which plays a major
load-bearing role in the roadway surrounding rock, signiﬁcantly decreases. The damage to
the force chain network in the roof and ﬂoor intensiﬁes, and the force chain deformation
in the sidewalls becomes evident, with the damage depths of the left and right sidewalls
being 2.25 m and 1.92 m, respectively. When the joint density increases to 1.0 m/m−2, the
degree of damage to the force chain network in the surrounding rock further intensiﬁes.
The uneven distribution of joints in the sidewalls leads to severe deformation in the right
sidewall, with the force chain damage depth increasing from 2.25 m to 3.3 m, while the
damage depth in the left sidewall decreases from 1.92 m to 1.77 m. Overall, as the joint
density increases, the range of force chain damage in the sidewalls of the roadway enlarges.

Taking the example of the kinetic energy evolution curve of the roadway surrounding
rock with a joint density of εf = 0.2 m/m−2, Figure 20 reveals that the kinetic energy
curve can be divided into four stages [27–29]: (i) Kinetic Energy Release Stage (Stage I):
After roadway excavation, the strain energy of the surrounding rock is rapidly released
and converted into kinetic energy. Particles exhibit a tendency to move towards the
excavation area, and particle damage begins to occur around the sidewalls. The overall
kinetic energy of the surrounding rock gradually increases, reaching its maximum value
when the kinetic energy reaches point D. This stage is followed by the next stage. (ii) Kinetic
Energy Attenuation Stage (Stage II): In this stage, particles that experienced deformation
and damage in the previous stage come into contact again. The deformation rate of the
surrounding rock decreases, and the system’s kinetic energy begins to convert back into
strain energy. The overall kinetic energy of the surrounding rock decreases continuously
during this stage. (iii) Kinetic Energy Equilibrium Stage (Stage III): Under the inﬂuence of
the gravity of the overlying strata, the roadway surrounding rock undergoes continuous
deformation, and the previously accumulated strain energy is converted back into kinetic
energy release. (iv) Kinetic Energy Stability Stage (Stage IV): In this stage, the overall kinetic
energy of the surrounding rock remains at a relatively low level, indicating that the model
has reached an equilibrium state.

netic energy and residual kinetic energy with respect to joint density. As the joint density 
increases, the maximum released kinetic energy shows linear growth, as shown in Figure

energy increases from 149.85 kJ to 429.09 kJ, an increase of 186%. This indicates that the 
disturbance eﬀects on the roadway surrounding rock intensify, making the rock highly 
susceptible to deformation. It suggests that the increase in joint density leads to a decrease 
in the overall bearing capacity of the roadway surrounding rock and an increase in rock 
deformation rate. Figure 21b reveals that the residual released kinetic energy shows a 
trend of increasing, decreasing, and then increasing again with increasing joint density.

5. Conclusions 
In the geometric information of a joint, joint density is one of the key parameters that 
aﬀect the strength and stability of engineering rock masses. Therefore, it is necessary to 
investigate the impact of joint density on the stability of complex jointed roadway sur-
rounding rock. In this study, taking Zhaogu No. 2 Coal Mine as the engineering back-
ground, the micro-contact parameters of particles and joint surfaces in each rock layer 
were calibrated through uniaxial compression tests and shear tests. Based on the cali-
brated micro-contact parameters, a multilayer roadway surrounding rock model with 
complex joints was established to investigate the inﬂuence of joint density on the stability 
of the roadway surrounding rock. The research results provide reference for explaining 
the failure rule of roadway surrounding rock with complex joints, studying the failure 
mechanism of roadway surrounding rock and proposing the corresponding support 
scheme. The main conclusions are as follows: 
(1) As the distance from the sidewall decreases, the inﬂuence of joint density on the de-
formation of the surrounding rock mass increases. However, the displacement of the 
roadway roof, ﬂoor, and sidewalls is aﬀected by joint density to varying degrees, 
mainly related to the rock’s lithology. 
(2) During the process of rock stress redistribution, the vertical stress of the roof and 
ﬂoor undergoes more signiﬁcant release compared to the horizontal stress, while the 
horizontal stress of the sidewalls undergoes more signiﬁcant release compared to the 
vertical stress. The increase in joint density leads to an increasing rate of stress release 
in the surrounding rock, causing the load-bearing rock mass to transfer to deeper 
layers. 
(3) The presence of joints weakens the overall bearing capacity of the surrounding rock. 
With the increase in joint density, the distribution of force chain networks gradually 
transitions from dense to sparse, and the strong force chain networks decrease. As a

5. Conclusions
In the geometric information of a joint, joint density is one of the key parameters
that affect the strength and stability of engineering rock masses. Therefore, it is necessary
to investigate the impact of joint density on the stability of complex jointed roadway
surrounding rock. In this study, taking Zhaogu No. 2 Coal Mine as the engineering

were calibrated through uniaxial compression tests and shear tests. Based on the calibrated
micro-contact parameters, a multilayer roadway surrounding rock model with complex
joints was established to investigate the inﬂuence of joint density on the stability of the
roadway surrounding rock. The research results provide reference for explaining the failure
rule of roadway surrounding rock with complex joints, studying the failure mechanism of
roadway surrounding rock and proposing the corresponding support scheme. The main
conclusions are as follows:
(1)
As the distance from the sidewall decreases, the inﬂuence of joint density on the
deformation of the surrounding rock mass increases. However, the displacement of
the roadway roof, ﬂoor, and sidewalls is affected by joint density to varying degrees,
mainly related to the rock’s lithology.
(2)
During the process of rock stress redistribution, the vertical stress of the roof and
ﬂoor undergoes more signiﬁcant release compared to the horizontal stress, while the
horizontal stress of the sidewalls undergoes more signiﬁcant release compared to
the vertical stress. The increase in joint density leads to an increasing rate of stress
release in the surrounding rock, causing the load-bearing rock mass to transfer to
deeper layers.
(3)
The presence of joints weakens the overall bearing capacity of the surrounding rock.
With the increase in joint density, the distribution of force chain networks gradually
transitions from dense to sparse, and the strong force chain networks decrease. As a
result, the overall bearing capacity of the surrounding rock decreases, and the range
of deformation and failure of the sidewalls increases.
(4)
As the joint density continuously increases, the values of maximum released kinetic
energy and residual released kinetic energy become larger. Excavation disturbance
leads to increasingly severe damage to the roadway surrounding rock. When the
Sustainability 2023, 15, 13561

joint density reaches a certain value, the roadway surrounding rock maintains a high
energy level in the kinetic energy stability zone, indicating extreme instability in the
roadway and the presence of sustainable deformation.
