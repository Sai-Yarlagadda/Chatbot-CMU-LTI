Introduction: To extend individuals’ healthy life expectancies, the improvement 
of subjective health and quality of life (QOL) has been increasingly prioritized, 
alongside the improvement of their physical functioning. Reports have indicated 
that intake of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) benefits the physical health of 
older individuals requiring nursing care, and athletes, and healthy individuals. But 
there are few studies investigating the effects of MCTs on subjective health and 
QOL. The present study sought to evaluate the combined effects of 12-week 
MCTs supplements and moderate-intensity walking exercise on the subjective 
health and QOL of middle-aged and older adults aged 60–74 with low BMIs (< 
24  kg/m2) and who had no exercise habits.
Methods: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial was conducted. 
Three MCTs supplement groups with different doses and fatty acid compositions 
were compared with a control group. The study used the SF-36v2 questionnaire 
to assess subjective health and health-related QOL (HRQOL).
Results: The result showed significant improvements in the scores on subscales of 
the physical QOL, such as Physical functioning and General health, and summary 
scores on the mental QOL, compared to the control.
Conclusion: It is estimated that the combination of continuous intake of MCTs 
and walking exercise may affect HRQOL and improve subjective physical and 
mental health in sedentary, healthy, middle-aged and older adults.

1 Introduction
In Japan in 2021, the percentage of people aged 65 years and older 
comprised 28.9% of the total population. This is one of the highest 
such percentages in the world, and it is estimated to reach 31.2% by 
2030 (1). Among this aging population, the number of people 
requiring long-term care and support continues to increase (2, 3). This 
trend not only leads to a decrease in their quality of life (QOL) (4), but 
also contributes to the costs of health care and long-term care (5, 6). 
Furthermore, the gap between average life expectancy and healthy life 
expectancy (i.e., the period during which some kind of support or 
long-term care is required) has remained at around 10 years for both 
men and women over the past dozen years (1). Increasing the number 
of people who can live independently, and extending healthy life 
expectancy, also reduces the burden on the people around them.
In the prevention of the necessity of long-term care, efforts have 
been made to improve not only the physical functions of older people, 
but also their QOL and subjective health status (7). It has been 
reported that improving physical function alone does not improve 
QOL, including subjective health status, in community-dwelling older 
adults in Japan (8). Additionally, subjective health has been reported 
to correlate with healthy life expectancy (9). Therefore, it is important 
to address not only the physical aspects of health, but also to improve 
QOL and subjective health in order to extend healthy life expectancy.
Medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) is the broad term used to refer 
to straight-chain saturated fatty acids with 6–12 carbon chains. 
Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) composed of MCFA have the 
property of being preferentially converted into energy in the body 
after ingestion, unlike ordinary fats and oils, which consist of long-
chain triglycerides (LCTs) (10). In clinical studies, a continuous daily 
consumption of 6 g of MCTs has been reported to improve physical 
function and body composition in older people. At a long-term care 
hospital, this MCTs intake led to an improvement in blood albumin 
levels, an indicator of malnutrition (11). In addition, significant 
improvements in grip strength, walking speed, and muscle mass were 
observed in nursing home residents (12, 13). Furthermore, animal 
studies have reported that continuous intake of MCTs increased 
mitochondrial biosynthesis (14) and activation of pathways involved 
in albumin synthesis in the liver (15). A case study of athletes reported 
a reduction in subjective fatigue with continuous intake of MCTs (16).
Regarding the effects of MCTs on mitochondrial function, which 
is associated with fatigue, animal studies have reported that both 
octanoic acid and decanoic acid increase mitochondrial biosynthesis 
and fatty acid oxidation-related gene expression, respectively (17, 18). 
Continuous intake of MCTs has been reported to increase fat 
oxidation during exercise in normal weight (19) and overweight (20) 
individuals having no exercise habits. Thus, continuous consumption 
of MCTs may benefit the physical health of people who need long-
term care, and athletes, and normal-weight and overweight 
individuals. However, few studies have examined the effects of MCTs 
supplements on QOL and subjective health, and the effects of differing 
MCFA compositions and intake of MCTs are unknown.
In this study we investigated the effects of continuous intake of 
MCTs and moderate-intensity exercise on QOL and subjective health 
in healthy, middle-aged and older men and women with low BMIs, 
who had no exercise habits. In addition, three MCTs supplement 
groups were established to investigate the effect of MCTs doses and 
fatty acid composition.
2 Methods
Details of ethics, sample size, inclusion and exclusion criteria of 
subjects, study design and allocation of participants, management 
during the intervention period, dietary intervention, physical exercise 
intervention, lifestyle survey, dietary survey were described 
previously (21).
2.1 Ethics
The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki (revised in 2013), the Japanese Ethical Guidelines for Medical 
and Health Research Involving Human Subjects, and the Japanese Act 
on the Protection of Personal Information (22, 23). We obtained 
approval from the ethics committees of the Yoga Allergy Clinic 
(approval number 21000023, approval date May 13, 2022). 
We registered this clinical trial in UMIN-CTR before the recruitment 
of participants (UMIN000046861).1 The measurement of HRQOL was 
a secondary endpoint of this study.
2.2 Sample size
In a previous study of MCTs in a test diet, their effect on physical 
function was confirmed in 21 cases; older adults in nursing homes, 
with BMIs of 23 kg/m2 or less and aged 65 years or older, were fed 6 g 
of MCTs per day for three months (12). In the present study the 
amounts of MCTs in the test supplement were 6 g and 2 g, being equal 
to and one-third of the amount in the previous study. The number of 
cases in this study was set at 30 per group (120 in total), on the 
assumption that the number of cases required would increase and on 
the expectation that there would be drop-outs during the study and 
that some patients would be ineligible for analysis.
2.3 Subjects
Participants were Japanese males and females aged 60–74 years, 
with a BMI in the range from 19 kg/m2 to less than 24 kg/m2, who 
exercise or walk less than once a week, and for less than 30 min each 
time, and who did not routinely (for more than four hours a week) 
provide childcare or nursing care. Individuals who were instructed by 
a doctor to refrain from walking or exercising, or who were serious 
illness were excluded.
2.4 Study design and allocation of 
participants
The study was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, parallel-
group trial with a placebo as the control diet. A party not involved in 
the trial (the test diet allocation manager) divided the subjects into 
four groups by stratified randomization: test diet groups (three types) 
1 https://rctportal.niph.go.jp/s/detail/um?trial_id=UMIN000046861
Ishikawa et al.

and control diet group. The allocation factors were age, sex, and blood 
albumin level. After allocation, the test diet allocation manager 
confirmed that there were no significant differences between the four 
groups in age, sex, and blood albumin levels. The test diet allocation 
manager kept the test diet allocation list strictly confidential until the 
key was opened, and blinding was maintained for all parties except the 
test diet allocation manager.
2.5 Management during the intervention 
period
During the study period, the participants were instructed to avoid 
excessive physical activity, other than exercise interventions, to 
maintain normal lifestyle habits. If they performed non-routine 
household chores requiring physical effort (cleaning, redecoration and 
repair of the house, shoveling snow) or recreational trips for 
unavoidable reasons, they were instructed to record the details of these 
activities on the lifestyle questionnaire.
2.6 Dietary intervention
During the study period, one packet of the supplement containing 
3 g of oil was taken as a supplement after any two of the three daily 
meals, breakfast, lunch, and dinner (two packets per day, 6 g of fats 
and oils). The oils in the supplements were LCTs (rapeseed oil from 
The Nisshin OilliO Group, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and MCTs (Nisshin 
MCT oil, Nisshin MCT-C10R, also from The Nisshin OilliO 
Group, Ltd.).
The four supplements were: the control supplement, Decanoic 
acid supplement, High-dose octanoic acid supplement, and Low-dose 
octanoic acid supplement. The daily amounts of LCTs, MCTs, and 
MCFAs contained in MCTs per 6 g of oil in the supplements are shown 
in Table  1. The subjects were instructed to maintain their 
pre-intervention dietary habits during the study period, except for the 
consumption of supplements.
The three MCT supplement groups were established for the 
following reasons. First, the MCTs (High-dose octanoic acid 
supplement in this study) which Abe et  al. found to improve 
muscle strength and other parameters in persons requiring 
nursing care, were established to establish whether there would 
be  a similar improvement in the subjects in this study (13). 
Second, a reduced dose group (Low-dose octanoic acid 
supplement) was established to test whether a similar effect would 
be observed at a lower dose. Among the MCFAs, octanoic acid 
and decanoic acid have been reported to have different effects on 
mitochondrial function (17, 24). High-dose octanoic acid 
supplement comprised MCTs rich in octanoic acid. Therefore, 
MCTs rich in decanoic acid (Decanoic acid supplement) were 
used to examine differences in the effects on subjective health 
between the consumption of MCTs rich in decanoic acid and 
MCTs rich in octanoic acid. LCTs in edible oils consumed daily 
were used as control.
2.7 Physical exercise intervention
During the study period, participants were instructed to walk for 
40 ± 10 min on two days each week and to record their performance 
on the lifestyle questionnaire. They were instructed to maintain their 
habitual walking speed. Exercise was to be  performed on 
non-consecutive days of the week whenever possible. For safety 
reasons, the following indoor exercises were used as an alternative on 
days when it was raining or extremely hot.
 (1) Subjects having access to a walking machine, treadmill, etc., 
could use it to walk at a normal walking speed for the 
prescribed duration.
 (2) For subjects having no such facilities, foot stamping on a flat 
surface for a specified duration at a pace equivalent to habitual 
walking on the spot, without moving, was an acceptable 
alternative to walking outdoors.
 (3) If such alternative indoor exercise was carried out, it was to 
be recorded on the lifestyle questionnaire.
If any exercise could not be carried out for some unavoidable 
reason, the reason was to be recorded on the lifestyle questionnaire.
In a Japanese guideline (the Physical Activity Reference for 
Health Promotion 2013), normal walking was introduced as 3.0 
metabolic equivalents (METs), strolling as 3.5 METs, and walking 
at a slightly faster pace as 4.3 METs (25). In this study, neither 
slow nor fast walking was instructed, and walking at a habitual 
pace was encouraged. Therefore, the subjects’ exercise was 
estimated to be 3.0–3.5 METs, which was defined as moderate 
intensity walking.
2.8 Lifestyle survey
Participants were asked to report their living conditions during 
the study period, such as consumption of the test diet, physical 
condition, medication, exercise, and alcohol consumption, using the 
lifestyle questionnaire.

2.9 Adverse events
During the study period, adverse events were investigated daily 
via the lifestyle questionnaire. If an adverse event occurred, the 
investigator immediately took the necessary and appropriate action, 
assessed the adverse event, and graded it for causal relation to the test 
diets as follows: none; probably none; may have; probably yes; yes; not 
assessable. Events other than those judged by the investigator to 
be “probably none” or “none” in causal relation to the test diets were 
considered to be adverse events.
2.10 Dietary survey
During the 12-week intervention period, dietary surveys of the 
normal diet without supplements were conducted before the 
intervention, and for four, eight, and 12 weeks after the intervention. 
Dietary surveys were conducted using a brief, self-administered diet 
history questionnaire (BDHQ).
2.11 Measurements
During the 12-week intervention period, subjective health 
and knee extension strength were measured before the 
intervention, and four weeks, eight weeks, and 12 weeks after 
the intervention.
The SF-36v2 (Japanese standard version), a HRQOL questionnaire, 
was used to assess subjective health. The SF-36 is the world’s most 
widely used questionnaire to assess subjective health, and its reliability 
and validity have been scientifically verified in Japan. It measures 
subjective health in eight subscales: physical function (PF), role 
physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health perception (GH), 
vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotional (RE), and mental 
health (MH). In addition, the eight subscales can be analyzed together 
into three component summary scores: the physical component 
summary (PCS) consisting of PF, BP, GH, RP, SF, and VT; mental 
component summary (MCS) consisting of BP, GH, SF, RE, VT, and 
MH; and role-social component summary (RCS) consisting of BP, 
GH, RP, SF, and RE (26, 27).
Knee extension strength of both right and left legs was measured, 
using a lower limb muscle strength measuring device (Locomo 
Scan-II; ALCARE Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
2.12 Statistical analysis
The analysis was performed in accordance with the statistical 
analysis plan.
Subject characteristics and nutrient intakes calculated from 
BDHQs are shown as mean ± standard deviation. For HRQOL 
survey score data, actual value and change values, which are post-
intervention values (at four, eight, and 12 weeks of intake) relative 
to before the intervention (week 0 of intake), are shown as 
mean ± standard deviation.
Multiple comparisons were made of nutrient intakes during the 
intervention period, to compare the control supplement and MCTs 
supplements. First, the equal variance was tested for each data set, 
using Levene’s test. If Levene’s test result was significant, Steel’s test was 
conducted; if not significant, Dunnett’s test was conducted.
HRQOL survey score data were first compared among the four 
groups by multiple comparisons for the values at week 0.
If there were no significant differences, a linear mixed model was 
used, with diet and time as fixed effects and subject as a random effect, 
to test for interactions between diet and time effects for the 
longitudinal measurements (at four, eight, and 12 weeks of intake). If 
no interaction was found, a linear mixed model equation without an 
interaction term was used to test for the diet effect for the longitudinal 
measurements. If a diet effect was found, multiple comparisons were 
performed between the four groups at each intervention period (four, 
eight, and 12 weeks of intake). If an interaction was found, a one-way 
analysis of variance was used to confirm the dietary effect. If there 
were significant differences, multiple comparisons were performed 
between the four groups at each intervention period (four, eight, and 
12 weeks of intake). Multiple comparisons between the four groups 
were first tested for equal variance by Levene’s test. We then performed 
Steel’s test if equivariance was found, or Dunnett’s test if no 
equivariance was found.
For within-group comparisons of data at weeks 4, 8, and 12, 
based on week 0, equal variance was tested by Levene’s test, and 
multiple comparisons by Steel’s test if significant, or by Dunnett’s 
test if not.
Descriptive statistics of the analyzed data were calculated using 
Microsoft Excel for Office 365 MSO (Microsoft Japan Corporation, 
Tokyo, Japan). R statistical software, v4.1.0 for Windows (R Core 
Team, Vienna, Austria) was used for statistical processing. In all 
significant difference analyses, a risk ratio of less than 5% was 
considered significant, and a risk ratio of 5–10% was considered 
a tendency.
2.13 Exploratory analysis
A Pearson’s correlation test was conducted to determine the 
relationship between subjective health and muscle strength for 
exploratory analysis. Correlation coefficients were calculated using 
change values from 0 to 12 weeks in the SF-36v2 score and knee 
extension strength data as variables. In addition, we calculated partial 
correlation coefficients for SF-36v2 and knee extension strength, 
adjusting for gender, age, and fat free mass as covariates. Regarding 
gender, we assigned dummy variables as male = 1 and female = 2 for 
the analysis.
3 Results
Some of the data from this study (nutrients intake and knee 
extension strength) has been reported previously (21).
3.1 Analysis of subjects
A flowchart of the subjects of the analysis is shown in Figure 1. 
Those who gave written consent (n = 258) were assessed for eligibility 
Ishikawa et al. 
10.3389/fnut.2023.1296896
Frontiers in Nutrition
05
frontiersin.org
and 138 were excluded. The eligible subjects (n = 120) were enrolled 
and randomized into four groups of 30. Of those who completed the 
study (n = 119), those excluded by the statistical analysis plan were 
included in the analysis as per protocol set (PPS) (n = 112). A 
characteristic of the study participants has been described 
previously (21).
In this study, compliance was properly maintained. As a result, 
89.9% of the subjects consumed 2 packets of test supplement daily 
during intervention. The remaining subjects also had an intake rate of 
over 98%. In addition, during the study period, walking was performed 
by all participants two days per week, although some participants 
performed the alternative indoor exercise due to the weather.
3.2 Adverse events
There were no adverse events attributed to the test supplement 
during this study.
3.3 Nutrient intake
There were no significant differences in nutrient intakes between 
the control supplement group and MCTs supplement groups, before 
or during the study period. Nutrient intakes were reported 
previously (21).
3.4 Test results of SF-36v2
The actual values and change values in each SF-36v2 score are 
shown in Table 2. There were no significant differences in any of the 
pre-intervention scores between the control group and MCTs 
supplement groups. In the control group there was no significant 
change in any of the SF-36 scores during the intervention period, 
compared to the pre-intervention period. As a result of the 12-week 
intervention, physical function (PF), general health (GH), vitality 
(VT) and mental component summary (MCS) showed significant 
increases in scores in all MCT supplement groups compared to the 
control group, either in actual or change scores. In addition, there was 
a significant increase in mental health (MH) scores in the Decanoic 
acid supplement and Low-dose octanoic acid supplement groups, 
compared to the control group. There were no significant changes in 
role-physical (RP), body pain (BP), social functioning (SF) and role-
mental (RE), nor in physical component summary (PCS) or role-
social component summary (RCS).
3.5 Correlation between SF-36v2 score and 
knee extension strength
The details of knee extension strength were reported previously 
(21). The results of the knee extension muscle strength measurements 
at 0 and 12 weeks are shown in Table 3. At week 12 of the intervention, 
all MCT supplement groups showed an increase from baseline in right 
knee extension strength, compared to the control group. For left knee 
extension strength, only the Decanoic acid supplement and Low-dose 
octanoic acid supplement groups showed higher values than the 
control group. The correlation coefficients between knee extension 
strength and SF-36 are shown in Table 4. A weak positive correlation 
was found between knee extension strength and MCS in Decanoic 
acid supplement group (0.40, p < 0.05). There was a positive correlation 
between knee extension strength and VT in Low-dose octanoic acid 
supplement group (0.42, p < 0.05). In contrast, in High-dose octanoic 
acid supplement group, a small positive correlation was found 
between right knee extension strength and PF (0.38, p < 0.05), but no 
correlation was found between VT, MH, MCS, and knee extension 
strength. This trend was similar when partial correlations were 
calculated using age, sex, and fat free mass as adjustment variables 
(Supplementary Tables S1–S4).

generally below average for Japanese people of that age group (28). The 
intervention consisted of continuous supplements of MCTs combined 
with moderate-intensity equivalent walking for 12 weeks. The results 
showed significant improvements in scores on several subscales of the 
SF-36 in all MCTs supplement groups, compared to the control group. 
Therefore, regardless of the octanoic and decanoic acid composition, 
it is speculated that the combination of a continuous daily intake of 2 g 
or more of MCTs and walking may have an effect on subjective health 
and HRQOL in healthy middle-aged and older adults with lower BMIs 
and no exercise habits.
This study evaluated the effects of continuous MCTs intake and a 
moderate-intensity exercise intervention on mental and physical 
aspects of subjective health and social functioning, using the SF-36. 
The scoring of the subjects, based on the national standard score of 
the SF-36 at baseline (26), showed that all scores were above 50 points. 
There were significant increases in PF, GH, VT, and MCS in all MCTs 
supplement groups at week 12, compared to the control. MH also 
increased significantly in Decanoic acid supplement and Low-dose 
octanoic acid supplement groups. On the other hand, there were no 
significant changes in RP or BP, and there was no change in PCS, a 
summary score of physical health. The results indicated that the 
biggest effects of this intervention were in improving the mental 
aspect of QOL among the mental, physical, and social aspects of 
health. It also suggested improvements in PF, GH, and VT, which are 
subscales of PCS, and in GH, which is a subscale of RCS. Therefore, 
MCTs intake and walking have been shown to potentially improve 
mental aspects of QOL in middle-aged and older adults with no 
exercise habits and low BMIs.
Previous studies have shown a correlation between physical 
activity and HRQOL scores (29, 30). A study of healthy individuals 
aged 60–89 years in the U.S. reported higher HRQOL scores in the 
group that engaged in more than one hour of moderate-intensity 
physical activity per week, compared with the group that engaged in 
less than one hour per week (30). Referring to previous studies in the

U.S., the present study predicted an improvement in HRQOL scores 
with increased physical activity. However, our control group showed 
no significant changes in all SF-36 items, as measured before and after 
the intervention.
On the other hand, because middle-aged and older adults with no 
exercise habits were subjected to exercise, there was a possibility that 
mental and physical fatigue associated with the walking exercise might 
affect the SF-36 score. However, the control group in this study 
showed no significant changes in physical health, mental status, or 
items representing the frequency of feeling tired. It is possible that in 
addition to the increase in physical activity, the consumption of MCTs 
may have affected subjective health.
In Japan it is recommended to exercise at least two days a week, 
for at least 30 min per session, to reduce the risk of age-related 
decline in functional capability in daily living, and to extend the 
period of independent living by increasing the intensity and 
frequency of physical activity (31). This is comparable to the 
exercise load in the present study, but no participants dropped out 
of the study because of the walking exercise intervention. 
Therefore, the results may be valuable in that continued MCTs 
intake, combined with relatively easy exercise, may have improved 
HRQOL in the subjects of this study.
There were significant increases in the MCTs supplement groups, 
compared to the control, especially in the subscales of mental aspects 
of health, such as VT, MH and GH. Their summary score, MCS, was 
also significantly increased. In a study investigating the effects of 
MCTs on mental health, the effects of medium-and long-chain 
triglycerides (MLCTs) on depression-like symptoms were reported in 
animal studies. One study suggested that the intake of MLCTs 
alleviated depression-like behavior and had an antidepressant-like 
effect compared to the intake of LCTs in mice subjected to the stress 
of continuous forced swimming (32). This trend is similar to the result 
of the present study, which shows a significant improvement in MH 
and MCS scores, which indicate a depressed mental state. It is 
speculated that consumption of MCTs may affect subjective health, 
especially the mental aspect of health.
On the other hand, there was a significant change in PF, a 
subscale that significantly affects the physical aspect of health, 
although there was no change in PCS. The PF-related questions 
include an assessment of the walking and score has been reported 
to correlate with walking function (33). Therefore, in addition to 
the improvement in walking function resulting from the walking 
exercise as an intervention, lowering the psychological barrier to 
walking is thought to be one of the reasons for the increased PF 
score. Additionally, in the MCTs supplement groups, there was a 
significant increase in lower limb strength after the intervention, 
compared to the control group. It has been reported that 
continuous intake of MCTs increases metabolism-related enzymes 
in skeletal muscle (14, 34). Therefore, in our MCTs supplement 
groups, it is hypothesized that increased fatty acid oxidation 
capacity provided an ample energy supply for muscle activation 
in skeletal muscle. This increase in energy supply may have 
contributed to the improvement in muscle strength, consequently 
leading to the increase in PF scores.
The SF-36 is an assessment that measures subjective physical 
and mental health, but it is also used to assess subjective fatigue. 
Subjective fatigue is a subjective feeling of awareness of the 
presence of physical and mental fatigue. VT, which represents the 
frequency of experiencing fatigue, has been used as a measure of 
physical fatigue in several clinical studies and its validity has been 
reported (35, 36). In addition, MH is an indicator of levels of 
anxiety and depression, which have been reported to correlate with 
fatigue (37, 38). Moreover, both MH and MCS have been reported 
to have a strong negative correlation with mental fatigue, a subscale 
of the MFI-20 used as a fatigue assessment method (MCS 
r = −0.563, MH -0.550, VT -0.574, SF -0.500) (39). Intake of 
coenzyme Q10, which has been reported to have fatigue-reducing 
effects, resulted in increased SF-36 VT, MH, and MCS scores, 
alongside a decreased salivary secretory immunoglobulin A 
secretion rate — a biological indicator of stress closely related to 
fatigue (40). In addition, VT has been used as a measure of physical 
fatigue, while MH and MCS have been used as indicators of mental 
fatigue (41). Although biomarkers were not evaluated in the 
present study, and the direct relationship to fatigue is not clear, 
significant increases in VT, MH, and MCS were observed in the 
MCTs supplement groups. It can be  speculated that the 
combination of MCTs intake and moderate-intensity exercise may 
reduce subjective physical and mental fatigue in middle-aged and 
older adults. It is also considered that this reduction in fatigue 
might contribute to the improvements in SF-36 scores.
Several mechanisms have been proposed for the perception of 
fatigue. It has been suggested that decreased adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP) production due to mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular 
inflammation caused by oxidative stress, are related to fatigue (42, 43). 
Coenzyme Q10 and imidazole dipeptide are food ingredients that 
reduce mental and physical fatigue. These mechanisms of action have 
been reported to increase in mitochondrial ATP production and 
antioxidant effects (44), as well as anti-inflammatory effects via 
antioxidant effects (45).
Excessive production of reactive oxygen radicals in muscle and 
nerve cells due to over-exertion causes oxidation and damage to cells 
and intracellular proteins and lipids. Whether it is exercise-induced 
fatigue or psychological work-related fatigue, cytokines produced by 
the immune system cells that detect this damage are sent to the cranial 
nervous and endocrine systems, leading to the perception of fatigue. 
It has been suggested that fatigue can be delayed if sufficient energy is 
not available to repair the cells at that time (46). Indeed, increased 
levels of oxidative stress and decreased efficiency of mitochondrial 
ATP production have been reported in patients with chronic fatigue 
syndrome (CFS) (47–49). Providing sufficient ATP by maintaining 
mitochondrial function and suppressing oxidative stress in vivo may 
be important in reducing subjective fatigue, as it leads to a reduction 
in fatigue.
Studies have reported that MCTs or octanoic acid and decanoic 
acid each work to increase mitochondrial biosynthesis and activation 
of metabolism-related enzymes in tissues such as the cranial nervous 
system and skeletal muscle (14, 17, 24, 34, 50) and decrease oxidative 
stress (46). Moreover, β-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone converted from 
MCT, has been reported to increase protein expression of Mn-SOD 
and catalase (51). Therefore, we speculate that such an increase in ATP 
production and antioxidant capacity may have been the underlying 
mechanisms for the improvement in SF-36 scores in this study, 
indicating alleviation of subjective fatigue. However, further research 
is needed to elucidate these mechanisms.

In this study we examined the effects of MCT dose and fatty acid 
composition on HRQOL, in combination with walking exercise. Our 
Low-dose octanoic acid supplement group, which had the lowest daily 
MCTs intake, and Decanoic acid supplement group, which had an 
octanoic acid intake similar to the Low-dose octanoic acid supplement 
group, had significant changes in several SF-36 items, compared to the 
control group. The High-dose octanoic acid supplement group had 
fewer items that showed significant differences from the control. One 
reason for this may have been differences in muscle mass and strength 
at baseline. Although no statistically significant differences were found 
between the groups, knee extension strength at week 0 was 
approximately 20 N and 70 N greater in the High-dose octanoic acid 
supplement group than in the Decanoic acid supplement and High-dose 
octanoic acid supplement groups, respectively (Table 3). In the Decanoic 
acid supplement and Low-dose octanoic acid supplement groups there 
were significant increases in both left and right knee extension strengths 
at the change value, compared to the control diet group. No significant 
change in right knee extension strength was observed in the High-dose 
octanoic acid supplement group. The high muscle mass at baseline may 
have had at least a small effect on this result.
We analyzed the correlations between the changes in knee 
extension strength and SF-36 scores during the intervention. 
We found a weak to moderate positive correlation in scores related to 
subjective fatigue (such as MCS or VT) only in the Decanoic acid 
supplement and Low-dose octanoic acid supplement groups. This 
means there was an association between increased lower limb muscle 
strength and improvement in the mental subjective health subscale in 
the Decanoic acid supplement and Low-dose octanoic acid 
supplement groups. It is speculated that the increase in lower limb 
muscle strength associated with MCTs consumption may have had a 
small positive effect on subjective health and fatigue. It has been 
reported that SF-36 scores are more likely to decrease in individuals 
with reduced muscle strength (52), suggesting that physical function 
correlates with HRQOL. In conclusion, these results suggest that a 
certain daily intake (1.24 g) of octanoic acid as MCFA, which 
constitutes MCTs, in combination with walking exercise, might 
improve subjective health and reduce subjective fatigue by increasing 
muscle strength in middle-aged and older adults with low BMIs and 
no exercise habits.
Octanoic acid has been shown to increase the amount of acylated 
ghrelin in the stomach (53), and to activate Akt/mTOR, which is 
involved in protein metabolism (15). In fact, it has been reported that 
continuous intake of octanoic acid-rich MCTs increased plasma 
albumin concentrations (11), skeletal muscle mass and strength (12, 
13). Therefore, it has been speculated that the antioxidant effect of 
albumin (54) and the increase in muscle strength may have influenced 
the present results. On the other hand, the mechanism by which 
decanoic acid intake increases muscle strength is not fully understood. 
This study was also unable to clarify the effects of different amounts 
of decanoic acid intake on HRQOL and subjective fatigue. Further 
studies are required, to investigate the mechanism by which decanoic 
acid affects muscle strength in animals and humans, to confirm the 
detailed dose–response. In this case, to establish the effects of decanoic 
acid dose, muscle strength and muscle mass at the baseline should 
be considered when assigning subjects.
Other factors that may affect this study include the fact that 
MCTs have been reported to be  more likely to cause 
gastrointestinal discomfort than LCTs (55). However, the 
discomfort of ingesting MCTs was not considered to have a 
significant impact because the subjects’ adherence to supplement 
consumption during the study period was high (over 90%) and 
they did not report any discomfort.
In this study, healthy men and women with no exercise habits 
undertook walking, a moderate-intensity exercise, twice a week. SF-36 
was evaluated before and after the intervention. There are several 
limitations to the study. Firstly, whether walking or MCT had a greater 
effect on HRQOL is not clear. Secondly, the effect on middle-aged and 
older adults with a habit of daily exercise is unknown. Thirdly, the 
effect on subjective health at moderate or higher exercise intensities is 
unknown. Lastly, the effect on fatigue is unknown because biomarkers 
of fatigue were not measured.
5 Conclusion
Using SF-36v2, this study investigated the effects of 12 weeks of 
MCTs supplements plus walking equivalent to moderate-intensity 
exercise twice a week on subjective health and HRQOL in middle-
aged and older adults with no exercise habits. The results showed that 
regardless of the MCFA composition of the MCTs and the amount of 
MCTs, the combination of continuous intake of 2 g or more of MCTs 
per day and walking exercise significantly improved scores on 
subscales of the physical aspect of QOL and summary scores on the 
mental aspect of QOL, compared with the LCTs intake used as a 
comparison. It is estimated that continuous intake of MCTs and 
walking might have affected HRQOL and improved physical and 
mental subjective health in middle-aged and older healthy adults with 
low BMIs.
