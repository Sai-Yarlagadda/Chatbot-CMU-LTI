Abstract. Explosives and propellants are common basic energy for weapons and equipment to 
achieve delivery, damage, and control, and are an important manifestation of national defense power. 
However, due to the wide variety of products and complex performance, the traditional serial design 
optimization mode can no longer meet the requirements of product diversification and rapid 
development. In this paper, the design process of explosives is deeply studied, and a method for 
optimizing the comprehensive performance of explosives and propellants oriented to the whole 
process is proposed. The method uses a comprehensive performance optimization engine to 
numerically model different design links in a unified parameter space, connects different links 
horizontally, and adopts a multi-objective optimization algorithm to comprehensively consider the 
optimization objectives of different links, realizing the automatic execution of the optimization process 
according to the design process. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, this paper 
optimizes the formula of explosives and propellants based on two different types of explosives, gun 
propellant and rocket propellant. Experimental results show that this method improves the design 
efficiency and improves product quality under the premise of ensuring safety and manufacturability. 
Keywords: Explosives and propellants; Optimization engine; Multi-objective optimization; parameter

1. Introduction 
Explosives and propellants are generally composite energetic materials composed of oxidizers, 
combustion agents, high-energy explosives, and functional materials. They are the main energy 
sources for land, sea, and air weapons. They play an irreplaceable and important role in the fields of 
national defense and aviation. Due to the toxic reagents involved in the synthesis and production 
process and the products are flammable and explosive, the current design and development cycle of 
explosives and propellant is long and inefficient, which greatly limits the iterative update of explosive 
and propellant products. With the vigorous development of computer software and hardware 
technology, especially the aided design, the use of numerical simulation technology to carry out the 
proportion design, power calculation and damage effect analysis of explosives and propellants has 
gradually become a research hotspot in the field of explosives and propellants. 
Foreign countries started early in the research of explosives and propellants. In terms of theoretical 
research, military powers such as the United States and Europe took the lead in adopting the research 
and development principle of " No experiment, Calculation first ". Since the 1970s, they have used 
advanced computer technology and combined structural chemistry, organic chemistry, quantum 
chemistry, physical chemistry, chemical informatics and other disciplines have carried out structural 
design, performance prediction, and virtual synthesis of explosives and propellants, effectively 
guiding synthesis experiments and greatly shortening the development cycle of new products, 
significantly reducing costs. In terms of simple energetic materials, the United States reduced the 
synthesis steps from four to three by calculating the synthesis mechanism of CL-20, so that the yield 
reached 92% and the purity was close to 100% [1]. Russia has done a lot of basic research work such 
as molecular design and route design on the furazan series of energetic materials, designed many 
energetic materials with excellent performance, and obtained the 3,4-bis. The new atom-economical

synthesis method of aminoglyoxime has become a new starting point for the synthesis of furan-like 
energetic materials. It is the first to synthesize bridged furan and furan-nitro compounds. The 
calculated detonation velocity of many compounds is close to 10000m /s [2]. In terms of mixed 
explosives and charges, a large number of researchers in the United States have been engaged in the 
research on the formulation and performance of explosives for a long time, and have established many 
effective theoretical models, such as the detonation model C-J model [3] and ZND model [4], and the 
non-ideal detonation model Wood-kirkwood model [5], BKW equation[6] and JWL equation[7] used 
to describe the state of detonation products, theoretical and empirical formulas used to estimate 
detonation parameters such as explosion pressure and detonation velocity[8], and the Forest Fire 
model [9], Lee-Tarver ignition growth model [10], JTF model [11], etc. used to simulate the shock 
safety of explosives, and the Cole and Zamyshlyayev empirical formulas used to calculate the 
explosion shock wave parameters of explosives in water, etc. [12], these Theoretical models and 
formulas are still used by explosives researchers all over the world and have played a huge role. 
Theoretical models are the basis for numerical simulations. 
While using computer technology to improve design strategies and calculation methods, military 
developed countries have successively developed a variety of molecular design software for energetic 
materials [13]. For example, the LOTUSES software developed in India can realize the prediction of 
the detonation performance and thermodynamic properties of energetic materials, such as density, 
detonation velocity, detonation pressure, detonation heat, decomposition products, etc. The 
GenMolTM software developed in France uses structural parameters as descriptors to predict the 
impact and friction sensitivity of energetic materials. MATEO software can carry out the molecular 
design of energetic materials, and can realize the estimation of density, enthalpy of formation, 
detonation performance, etc. The thermochemical calculation software EXPLO5 developed in the 
Czech Republic can predict the density, enthalpy of formation, and detonation performance of 
energetic materials, and is also applicable to the prediction of combustion performance of metal 
composite energetic materials. The CHEETAH software for predicting the detonation performance 
of energetic materials developed in the United States has a rich database and is highly recognized in 
the industry. The RMG software predicts the reaction mechanism through molecular structure coding, 
combined with resources such as chemical databases, reaction rules, and online computational 
chemistry. Virtualization design has also been basically realized in the aspect of mixed explosive 
formula and charge design. For example, the United States already has a series of simulation design 
programs, which can simulate and predict the performance of certain formulations and charges in 
terms of energy, safety, and vulnerability. This means that the performance of the charge has been 
mastered before the range test is carried out, and the range test is only used as a final verification 
method. 
Compared with developed military countries such as the United States, domestic theoretical 
research on explosives is still relatively weak, and basically stays in the analysis based on mature 
foreign theories, mainly focusing on the research on different attributes of explosives, focusing on 
the relationship between different attributes, there are few theoretical models and experimental 
methods independently proposed. For example, Wang Yawei [14] analyzed the influence of the 
relative content of components on the stability and safety of high-energy and low-sensitivity 
propellants. Zou Fengjuan [15] analyzed the extrusion time, extrusion temperature and extrusion die 
structure through numerical simulation to analyze the quality of the propellant. Zhao Liang [16] 
studied the effects of different sizes of ammunition on the cook-off response characteristics of 
explosives. Cheng Yuteng [17] studied the detonation shock wave characteristics of thermobaric 
explosives with different formulations in different environments through four methods: theoretical 
analysis, numerical simulation, open space static explosion test, and limited space static explosion 
test. 
In terms of simulation programs, there are not many simulation calculation programs of explosives 
and propellants independently developed in China. Individual research teams use some software 
internally, such as flame sensitivity calculation, and tool software such as mechanical properties and

comprehensive sensitivity developed based on general commercial software. Although the software 
has been applied in the development of related products, there are still some problems: such as the 
independence of various objects, algorithm databases, etc., the lack of unified specifications, and the 
lack of unified calling; the software performance is unstable, poor compatibility, Complicated 
operations etc. 
The performance of explosives and propellantsproducts is complex, and a large number of 
simulations and tests are involved in the design and development process. Although certain 
simulation technologies have been used in China, due to the particularity of the industry, many foreign 
software have blocked our country, resulting in the development of explosives is still mainly based 
on a large number of trial production tests, supplemented by simulation calculations. This research 
and development model relies heavily on experiments, resulting in high research and development 
time and economic costs; secondly, the existing model adopts the collaborative model of serial 
feedback and cannot meet the requirements of diversified and rapid product development. In order to 
meet the refined research and development under the new situation, it is necessary to carry out 
research on the comprehensive performance optimization of explosives and propellants, shorten the 
research and development cycle, and reduce the research and development cost. This paper studies 
the comprehensive performance optimization method of explosives and propellants, and proposes a 
comprehensive performance optimization method for explosives and propellants oriented to the 
whole process. 
2. Comprehensive Performance Optimization of Explosives and Propellants 
2.1. Design of comprehensive performance optimization engine  
The development process of explosive and propellant products usually includes formula design, 
charge design, process design, quality design and other links, each link is closely related to the 
comprehensive performance of the product. At present, the traditional optimization idea is to decouple 
the research and development process, and to optimize the involved links or a single attribute, but the 
factors related to the performance of explosives are complex, and the whole process involves dozens 
of design and simulation analysis tool software, hundreds of items of manual and mechanical 
processes. The optimization process requires repeated iterations to carry out experimental verification. 
In this paper, a comprehensive performance optimization engine is used to unify a large amount of 
structured and unstructured data generated in the whole process of product development into the same 
parameter space, and carry out multi-objective optimization for the whole process to improve the 
comprehensive performance of explosives. 
The optimization engine uses digital technology to carry out numerical modeling of each link in 
the development process, parameterizes the properties related to the performance of explosives, and 
solidifies the designer's experience knowledge and business rules into a model for rapid iteration. At 
the same time, the optimization engine learns the relationship between different links, opens up the 
data flow between different links, realizes process-based data linkage, greatly improves design 
efficiency, and achieves the purpose of automatic and full-process analysis. 
Due to the particularity of explosives and propellants, it is necessary to coordinate and optimize 
performance indicators in different aspects under the control conditions of product safety and 
manufacturability constraints when carrying out comprehensive performance optimization and 
improvement. In this paper, machine learning methods are used to obtain performance evaluation 
models for different aspects of the product. Based on the comprehensive performance optimization 
algorithm library, a constrained multi-objective optimization method is used to build a comprehensive 
performance optimization engine for explosives and propellants that is oriented to the entire process. 
Based on the automatic intelligent analysis of the design process, the engine can assist designers to 
fully understand the design space of explosive and propellant products, and find the optimal solution 
according to the optimization goal. The overall framework is shown in Figure 1 below.

2.2. Multi-objective comprehensive optimization 
As we all know, the purpose of optimization is to obtain a solution with the minimum cost from a 
problem that may have a large number of solutions, and avoid being trapped in a local optimum. 
Multi-objective optimization with constraints is usually a nonlinear problem, and simulated annealing 
algorithm is the most typical parameter optimization algorithm for finding the global optimal value 
in nonlinear problems. 
The simulated annealing algorithm comes from the process of crystal cooling. In the world of 
molecules and atoms, the greater the energy, the less stable the molecules and atoms are. When the 
energy is lower, the atoms are more stable. If the solid is not in the lowest energy state, the solid is 
heated and then cooled. As the temperature drops slowly, the atoms in the solid are arranged in a 
certain shape to form a high-density, low-energy regular crystal, which corresponds to the global 
optimal solution in the algorithm. And if the temperature drops too fast, it may cause the atoms to 
lack enough time to arrange into a crystalline structure, resulting in an amorphous with higher energy, 
which is the local optimal solution. Therefore, according to the annealing process, the temperature of 
the object can be increased, and then cooled, and increasing energy can help jump out of the local 
optimal solution. 
The simulated annealing algorithm is actually a greedy algorithm, but it introduces random factors 
in the search process. The simulated annealing algorithm accepts a solution that is worse than the 
current solution with a certain probability, so it is possible to jump out of the local optimum and reach 
the global optimum. The algorithm includes two parts, namely Metropolis algorithm and annealing 
process. In 1953, Metropolis proposed the importance sampling method, that is, to accept the new 
state by probability rather than using completely determined rules, which is called the Metropolis 
criterion, and the calculation amount is low. Metropolis algorithm is the basis of annealing to avoid 
the result falling into local optimum. 
According to the Metropolis criterion, assuming the previous state is x(n), the system changes to 
x(n + 1) according to a certain indicator state. Accordingly, the energy of the system changes from 
E(n) to E(n + 1), and the acceptance probability P of the system changes from x(n) to x(n + 1) 
is defined as: 
P = {
1,                       𝐸(𝑛 + 1) < 𝐸(𝑛)
𝑒−𝐸(𝑛+1)−𝐸(𝑛)
𝑇
 , 𝐸(𝑛 + 1) ≥ 𝐸(𝑛)
                          (1) 
Where T represents the temperature. From the above formula, we can see that if the energy 
decreases, the transfer will be accepted. If the energy increases, it means that the system deviates 
farther from the global optimal value. At this time, the algorithm will not immediately abandon it, but 
carry out probability operation, where P determines the size of probability P by the amount of 
energy change and T, so this value is dynamic. 
However, direct use of Metropolis algorithm may lead to too slow optimization speed. In order to 
ensure convergence in a limited time, it is necessary to set parameters to control the convergence of 
the algorithm. In the above formula, the parameter T can be adjusted. If the value of T is large, the 
annealing speed will be accelerated, and the iteration will end when the local optimal value is reached.

1127 
If the value is small, the calculation time will increase. Generally, the larger value of T is used at the 
initial stage of annealing, and will gradually decrease as the annealing proceeds. The formula is as 
follows: 
                            𝑇(𝑛 + 1) = 𝜆𝑇(𝑛)                                  (2) 
Where, T(n) represents the temperature at the nth round, n = 1,2,3 ⋯, where λ is a positive 
number less than 1, and the value is generally between 0.8 and 0.99. 
3. Experiments 
On the basis of in-depth research on the comprehensive performance optimization of explosives 
and propellants, with the help of rapid packaging and integration technology, this paper constructs a 
comprehensive performance optimization engine that covers the input and output of standardized 
parameters and is oriented to the entire process of explosives and propellants. In order to verify the 
optimized engine performance, experiments were carried out based on two types of explosive and 
propellant. 
3.1. Experimental setup 
There are many types of explosives, and different product development and design processes are 
different, resulting in differences in optimization steps. Comprehensive performance optimization 
needs to design different processes for different types of explosives and propellants, then 
parameterize each link, and finally carry out optimization under a unified framework. 
3.1.1 Process creation 
The comprehensive optimization engine includes all possible links in the design of explosives and 
propellants, achieving full coverage of the research and development process of explosives and 
propellants. A process template can contain several process nodes. The logical sequence relationship 
between nodes can be automatically generated with the help of big data analysis technology and 
supports custom modification. The input and output data of nodes and node trigger conditions can be 
adjusted as needed, as shown in Figure 2 shown. 
 
Fig. 2 Examples of processes created in the optimization engine 
3.1.2 Model parameterization  
The optimization engine uses big data analysis technology to analyze the impact of various factors 
on the comprehensive performance, mines the correlation between data, and automatically builds the 
correlation between the input and output parameters of different modules, so as to realize the 
automatic iterative optimization of the optimization process according to the business process.

3.1.3 Optimization process  
On the premise of the safety and manufacturability of explosives and propellants, the optimization 
engine optimizes the composition ratio to improve product performance according to the different 
design requirements of gun propellants and rocket propellants. 
In the experiment, the component distribution ratio is used as input data, and the upper and lower 
limits of the component distribution ratio are used as the key factors affecting the safety and 
manufacturability of explosives and propellants, and the optimal solution is obtained from a large 
number of possible solutions at the minimum cost. 
In the experiment, the group allocation ratio is taken as the input data, and the upper and lower 
limit of the group allocation ratio is taken as the key factor affecting the safety and manufacturability 
of explosives, and the optimal solution is obtained from a large number of possible solutions at the 
minimum cost. The optimization process takes the explosion temperature value of the gun propellant 
and the specific impulse of the rocket propellant as constraints, and optimizes the composition ratio 
so that the gunpowder power of the gun propellant and the temperature of the rocket propellant are 
close to the expected target. In order to avoid falling into a local optimum, the simulated annealing 
optimization algorithm in the optimization algorithm library was selected for optimization in the 
experiment. 
3.2. Experimental results 
The maximum temperature parameter of the simulated annealing algorithm is set to 1000, the 
minimum temperature is 100, the annealing rate is 0.8, the number of iterations in each round is 30, 
the probability coefficient is 100, and the retrieval step is 3. In the optimization process, the Energy 
software is used to calculate the energy by using the calculation method of constant energy and 
constant volume. The composition ratio in the formulation design of explosives and propellants is 
used as the input parameter of the optimization engine, and the upper and lower limits corresponding 
to different parameters are shown in Table 1 below.

In the gun propellant experiment, the detonation temperature value is a constraint condition, 
represented by Y1,, set to 3500k, the deviation must not exceed 20%, that is, the temperature results 
between 2800k~4200k meet the requirements, the number of cycle constraints is 100, and the

maximum cycle time for 10 seconds. The gunpowder power is the optimization target variable, and 
the expected target value is 1350J/Kg, denoted as M1. 
In the rocket propellant experiment, the specific impulse value is used as a constraint condition, 
represented by Y2, which is set to 2600s, and the deviation must not exceed 20%, that is, the result 
of the specific impulse between 2470s and 2730s meets the requirements. The target variable of 
propellant detonation temperature optimization is denoted by M2, and the expected target value is 
3500k. 
Observing the optimization process of the comprehensive performance optimization engine, it can 
be found that in the gun propellant experiment, the value of the propellant power gradually converges 
to around 1260, as shown in Figure 4; when the component ratio is set to 5:15:1:21:58, the gunpowder 
power of the gun propellant is closest to the expected value of 1350, as shown in Table 2 below. At 
this time, the gunpowder power value is 1260.71, and the explosion temperature is 3353.15. In the 
rocket propellant experiment, the detonation temperature gradually converges to around 3380, as 
shown in Figure 5; when the component ratio is 4:8:0:2:86, the detonation temperature is closest to 
the expected value of 3500, as shown in Table 3 below Show, At this time, the explosion temperature 
value is 3384.47, and the specific impulse is 2631. The experimental results show that the 
comprehensive performance optimization engine can optimize the ratio design of explosives and 
propellants, quickly find out the optimal design scheme, improve the efficiency and product quality 
of explosive and propellant development, and prove the effectiveness of the method in this paper.

4. Summary 
As the basis of energetic materials, explosives and propellants have complex manufacturing 
processes and product properties. The traditional serialization optimization method is to optimize 
each link in the design process separately, the optimization efficiency is low, and the operation is 
cumbersome. This paper deeply analyzes the design process of explosives and propellants, and 
proposes a comprehensive performance optimization method for explosives and propellants oriented 
to the whole process. The method uses a comprehensive performance optimization engine to 
numerically model the different design links of explosives and propellants, open up the data links 
between different links, unify the design of explosives and propellants into the same parameter space, 
and then optimize the results based on multi-objective optimization. In order to verify the 
effectiveness of the method, this paper carried out formula optimization experiments based on two 
different types of explosives and propellants. The results show that the comprehensive optimization 
engine can improve the design efficiency and quality of explosives and propellants on the premise of 
satisfying the safety and manufacturability, and achieve the goal of reducing the test cost and shorting 
development cycle.
