Abstract
A fundamental fact about human minds is that they are never truly alone: all minds are steeped in
situated interaction. That social interaction matters is recognized by any experimentalist who seeks
to exclude its inﬂuence by studying individuals in isolation. On this view, interaction complicates
cognition. Here, we explore the more radical stance that interaction co-constitutes cognition: that we
beneﬁt from looking beyond single minds toward cognition as a process involving interacting minds.
All around the cognitive sciences, there are approaches that put interaction center stage. Their diverse
and pluralistic origins may obscure the fact that collectively, they harbor insights and methods that can
respecify foundational assumptions and fuel novel interdisciplinary work. What might the cognitive
sciences gain from stronger interactional foundations? This represents, we believe, one of the key
questions for the future. Writing as a transdisciplinary collective assembled from across the classic
cognitive science hexagon and beyond, we highlight the opportunity for a ﬁgure-ground reversal that

puts interaction at the heart of cognition. The interactive stance is a way of seeing that deserves to be a
key part of the conceptual toolkit of cognitive scientists.
Keywords: Interaction; Cognitive science; Pluralism; Interdisciplinarity; Social interaction
Classical cognitive science started out by focusing on “the properties and operation of
the human mind,” deﬁnite and singular (Levinson, 2012; Keyser, Miller, & Walker, 1978).
This was more a practical choice than a principled one, but it turned out to be immensely
consequential. It set the cognitive sciences on a path in which product is privileged over
process, information over relations, and individuals over interactions. As a result, it obscured
how social interaction co-constitutes cognition (De Jaegher, Di Paolo, & Gallagher, 2010;
Enﬁeld, 2013; Vygotsky, 1962). Yet, interaction is what turns brains into minds. To truly
understand cognition, we must move beyond single-mindedness.
Work on situated action and distributed cognition paved the way by showing that peo-
ple’s plans and representations take shape in interaction and encompass minds as well as
material structures (Suchman, 2007 [1987]; Hutchins, 1995). In parallel, disparate lines of
work across the cognitive sciences have made progress by putting interaction center stage.
Although diverse in disciplinary origins, methods, and theories, these approaches are similar
in seeing cognition not as the province of singular minds but as an interactional achievement
of embodied agents. Yet, here is a curious fact: most of them are perceived as marginal in
their own disciplines. Their kinship and collective power becomes apparent only when we
change perspective––and when we do, we ﬁnd that the scene is set for a Gestalt switch that
puts interaction at the heart of cognition (Fig. 1).
What do the cognitive sciences have to gain from an interactive stance? It foregrounds
the potential of methodological and explanatory pluralism (Gentner, 2019) and creates new
opportunities for synergy across disciplinary borders. Take reasoning, in many ways the text-
book case of an individual cognitive capacity. Work in the last decade has thrown new light
on why we reason the way we do, unveiling the dialogical roots of reasoning (Dutilh Novaes,
2013, 2021) and suggesting that its primary function is not individual ratiocination but interac-
tive argumentation (Mercier & Sperber, 2017). Indeed, observational work shows how people
employ reasons in mundane interaction to coordinate joint action (Baranova & Dingemanse,
2016) in a context of ever-present social accountability (Enﬁeld & Sidnell, 2022). This shows
how the interactional angle can foster productive connections between philosophy, psychol-
ogy, and linguistics.
Or consider the study of autism and other expressions of neurodiversity, long reiﬁed (if
not fetishized) as special conditions that may shed light on classic topics like modular-
ity, theory of mind, and joint action coordination. Recent work calls attention to the need
to respecify neurodiversity from relational and interactional perspectives (Bolis, Balsters,
Wenderoth, Becchio, & Schilbach, 2017; Milton, 2012). This allows us to move away from
deﬁcit-based views toward more reciprocal contributions. For instance, a careful study of
neurodivergent interaction reveals how behaviors seen as “symptomatic of ASD” can be inter-
actionally achieved and coproduced by both participants (Muskett, Perkins, Clegg, & Body,

Fig. 1. “Fringe” is in the eye of the beholder. Realigning interaction-centered approaches from across disparate
ﬁelds can fuel a ﬁgure-ground reversal in the cognitive sciences, here illustrated with an assortment of sub-
ﬁelds around the classic hexagon: 1 interactional linguistics (Clift, 2016; Schegloff, Ochs, & Thompson, 1996);
2 grammars of language use (Ameka & Terkouraﬁ, 2019; Gregoromichelaki et al., 2022); 3 cognitive ethnography
(Hutchins, 1995); 4 situated action (Suchman, 2007); 5 social and second person neuroscience (Schilbach et al.,
2013; Wheatley, Boncz, Toni, & Stolk, 2019); 6 joint action (Shockley, Richardson, & Dale, 2009; Vesper, But-
terﬁll, Knoblich, & Sebanz, 2010); 7 dialogue modeling (Schlangen & Skantze, 2011); 8 embodied interaction
(Bennett et al., 2021); 9 discursive psychology (Edwards, 1997); 10 ecological psychology (R ˛aczaszek-Leonardi,
Nomikou, Rohlﬁng, & Deacon, 2018; Reddy, 2018); 11 social epistemology (Goldman, 1999); 12 interactivism
and enactivism (Bickhard, 2009; Di Paolo, Cuffari, & De Jaegher, 2018).
2010; and see Bottema-Beutel, Crowley, & Kim, 2022). Situated interaction is the meeting
ground for all kinds of minds, where cognitive processes are created and developed in dialec-
tical, social, and emotional relations (De Jaegher, 2021b; Reddy, 2018).
As a third example, consider interactive repair: the streamlined ways in which we prompt
each other to revise or recalibrate contributions in interaction (Albert & de Ruiter, 2018).
Occurring every few turns, repair is far too common to be just a remedial procedure or a last
resort (Ginzburg, 2012). Instead, empirical and experimental work reveals how repair drives
rapid coordination and efﬁcient communication in human interaction (Micklos & Woensdregt,
2022). Computational modeling shows that interactive repair can greatly alleviate the compu-
tational effort otherwise expended in pragmatic reasoning (Arkel, Woensdregt, Dingemanse,
& Blokpoel, 2020). As it distributes inferential and computational processes over turns and
minds, repair is a prime example of dialogically extended cognition (Fusaroli, Gangopadhyay,
& Tylén, 2014). The on-the-ﬂy recalibration embodied by repair is what makes ambiguity
surmountable (Piantadosi, Tily, & Gibson, 2012) and good-enough processing viable (Gold-
berg & Ferreira, 2022).

Fig. 2. Seen from Earth, the movements of celestial bodies display near-intractable complexity. When taking not
a single vantage point but multiple (here, Sun and Earth), suddenly the picture changes, and new forms of order
become visible (Sousanis, 2015). Likewise, key concerns of cognitive science may be illuminated by a change of
perspective that locates cognition not in isolated but in interacting minds.
These examples, necessarily selective, show some of the things a move beyond single-
mindedness can bring. Interaction offers an unprecedented view of the multiscale dynamics
of cognition: a form of direct empirical access that is hard to get otherwise (Wittgenstein,
1968 [1953]). Moreover, taking an interactional perspective can have far-reaching theoretical
consequences (Fig. 2). It can affect and even contest the very ontology of the phenomena
studied, whether it is a “capacity” like reasoning, a “disorder” like autism, or an “outcome”
like mutual understanding. Interaction is like a prism that brings out the irreducibly social
and relational aspects of everything that ﬂows through it, enabling new observations and
explanations (De Jaegher, 2021a; Enﬁeld, 2013; Sacks, 1992).
There are further areas where an interactive angle is critical for progress. A theory of
cognitive gadgets (Heyes, 2018) is incomplete without an account of how such gadgets
culturally evolve and come to be socially shared; in short, without empirical grounding in
social interaction. The mystery of metacognition (Frith & Frith, 2022) can only receive an
adequate explanation if we attend more closely to the material metacognitive tools supplied
by language in interaction: public cues to private states of mind that people make available in
every turn at talk. The cognitive abilities of nonhuman minds are exceedingly hard to probe,
except by studying sequentially organized social action (Bangerter, Genty, Heesen, Rossano,
& Zuberbühler, 2022). And in computer science, we can only hope to build artiﬁcial agents
and explain attributions of “intelligence” if we supplement the computational and cognitivist
bent of the ﬁeld with a deep understanding of situated interaction (Cassell, 2020; Ruane,
Birhane, & Ventresque, 2019; Seibt, Vestergaard, & Damholdt, 2020; Suchman, 2019).

We have argued for a recentering of the cognitive sciences around interacting minds. Are
there any aspects of cognition that can fully be understood from the perspective of single
minds? We do not know, but we submit that a reversal of the burden of evidence is in order.
The watershed divide between the mental and the social has always been at best a convenient
ﬁction (Shteynberg, 2014). As we come to terms with forms of cognition not centered on
single brains, interaction looms large as the crucial connective tissue: ontologically prior,
epistemologically fundamental, ecologically sound. As the cognitive sciences enter their next
phase, interaction will be core to the enterprise of understanding how minds are made.
