Most studies of the effects of urbanisation on local climate have been based on
ground observation data. In contrast, we used observation data from a boundary
layer
radar
wind
proﬁler,
radio-acoustic
sounding
system,
and
automatic
meteorological station located at Shenzhen Bao’an International Airport to
analyse changes in wind and virtual temperature in the upper level atmosphere,
with a top height of 1,200 m, over the Pearl River Estuary between 2011 and 2020.
Our results show that during the decade evaluated, the wind speed and virtual
temperature of the upper level atmosphere over the Pearl River Estuary changed very
signiﬁcantly and faster than the changes observed at ground level. During the study
period, the linear warming rate of the virtual temperature of the upper level
atmosphere reached 0.24°C/a, whereas that on the land surface was 0.17°C/a.
The mean decreases in the upper level atmosphere and land surface wind speeds
were −0.12 and −0.05 m/s·a, respectively. Additionally, the rate of change in the
upper level climate was faster in winter than in summer for both wind speed and
virtual temperature. These changes in the climate of the upper level atmosphere over
the Pearl River Estuary may be related to the rapid increase in the number of high-rise
buildings in the region during that decade, which generally negatively affected the
atmospheric environment.

1 Introduction
The Pearl River Delta (PRD) was among the fastest developing and urbanising regions
in China over the past 4 decades (Hui et al., 2020). This rapid urbanisation has notably
altered the physical attributes of the region’s land surface and, together with anthropogenic
heat and pollution emissions, has led to profound changes in the regional climate and
atmospheric environment of the PRD. The three key features of climate change in the PRD
are the increase of surface air temperature (Chan et al., 2012), the rapidly decrease of
surface wind speed (Peng et al., 2018), and the initially decreasing and subsequently
increasing relative humidity (Li et al., 2021a; Zhang et al., 2022). Compared with other
climate elements, the researches on temperature and wind speed in the ﬁeld of urbanization
effect on climate have received more attention, for the changes of thermophysical
properties and the increase of roughness of the Earth surface caused by urbanization

have the most direct impacts on temperature and wind speed. In
the PRD region, the average warming rate has been about 0.19°C/
decade since 1971 (Li et al., 2021). However, in the region with the
most rapid urbanization process in the PRD, the warming rate has
reached as high as 0.36°C/decade, and the contribution of the
urbanization effect to the warming rate can amazingly reach
81.4%–85.1% (Li et al., 2015). The statistics also show that the
annual mean wind speed showed an oscillatory downward trend
since 1970s, the decade-average wind speed of the GBA during the
period of 2011–2020 is 2.25 m/s, which is 0.22 m/s lower than the
value during the period of 1971–1980.
In addition to the regional climate, the atmospheric environment
of the PRD has also undergone signiﬁcant changes over the past
4 decades. Because of the region’s dense network of factories and
transportation routes, large volumes of pollutants are emitted into the
atmosphere, leading to poor air quality. Particularly, ﬁne particulate
matter (PM2.5) pollution was a severe problem in the PRD in the mid-
2000s, seriously affecting visibility in the region (Yang et al., 2020;
Song et al., 2021). The emerging city of Shenzhen recorded 187 days of
“haze” in 2004. After regional air pollution control measures were
implemented and several rounds of industrial upgrades were
performed, the PM2.5 in the PRD has decreased rapidly since the
mid-2000s, although ozone (O3) pollution has increased (Zhang et al.,
2018; Li et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022).
The regional climate and the atmospheric environment are
scientiﬁc issues closely related to each other. For example, as the
urban surface roughness increases, the near-surface wind speed
decreases (Lin et al., 2014), thus the advective transport of
pollutants is reduced and the accumulation of these pollutants
becomes to be easier than before. Circulation caused by strong
thermal processes in urban areas interacts with the background
wind ﬁeld, increasing the structural complexity of the near-surface
ﬂow ﬁeld at different spatial scales. These factors create challenges in
assessing and predicting pollutant meteorological conditions in urban
areas (Wang et al., 2019). In recent years, O3 concentration in the PRD
region has gradually increased, which is related to higher temperatures
(Wang et al., 2021). As such, the impact of urbanisation on the
regional
climate
is
gradually
expanding
to
the
atmospheric
environment.
In the vertical direction, changes in the structure of the
atmospheric boundary layer caused by urbanization also have a
signiﬁcant impact on the atmospheric environment in the PRD
region. Fan et al. (2007, 2011) pointed out that the structure of the
atmospheric boundary layer of PRD is jointly affected by the warm
and wet airﬂow from the south, the dry and cold north airﬂow across
the Nanling Mountains, the urban cluster in the region and the
peripheral circulation of tropical cyclones, which is an important
reason for the deterioration of atmospheric environment quality in
PRD region. Fan et al. (2018) found that there are strip or cellular
vortex structures inside the cities, and the strip structures could cause
the convergence and accumulation of pollutants around the strip,
resulting in a local high pollution zone. Some case studies have
conﬁrmed that the interaction between urban heat island and sea
land breeze will lead to small-scale convergence and local high
pollution (Wei et al., 2019).
Although progress has been made in studies of the effects of
urbanisation on climate and boundary layer structure in the PRD
and in the ability to use this information to adopt measures for
adjusting to urban climates, further improvements are needed in
this ﬁeld. Particularly, almost all previous studies of the effects of
urbanisation on climate in the region are based on surface
meteorological observations; thus, the validity of the conclusions
is limited to the atmospheric subdivision closest to Earth’s land
surface. On the other hand, the researches on the vertical structure
of the boundary layer in this region are generally focused on
individual cases, and lacks the understanding of the climate
characteristics
of
the
boundary
layer
based
on
long-term
observational data. While to analyse the effects of long-term
changes in climatic conditions on the atmospheric environment,
meteorological conditions must be considered vertically across the
whole atmospheric boundary layer, as the transport, diffusion, and
chemical reactions of pollutants are not limited to the land surface
(Shi et al., 2019; 2020). As a result, research should be extended to
at least the top of the daytime boundary layer at a typical height of
at least 1,000 m above the land surface in PRD region. However,
obtaining
vertical
data
is
difﬁcult,
and
meteorological
administration departments did not require these data to be
collected among operational observations for a long time. Thus,
climate change across the vertical boundary layer has not been
widely examined.
Shenzhen is one of the main cities in the PRD region. In less
than 40 years, Shenzhen has developed from a small city to a megacity
with a population of over 10 million (Zhang et al., 2018). Shenzhen
also has the densest meteorological observation network in the PRD
region. Additionally, at Shenzhen’s Bao’an International Airport, a
boundary layer radar wind proﬁler has been installed and has been
operational since around 2011, gathering observation data for more
than a decade. Using these data, we analysed changes in the climate of
the upper level atmosphere with a maximum top height of 1,500 m, in
the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) region over a 10-year period, which is
undoubtedly a progress when compared with the past studies on
climate effect of urbanisation only based on the ground level
observation.
2 Data and methods
The data obtained by the Vaisala LAP®-3000 wind proﬁler at
Shenzhen Bao’an International Airport (location is shown in
Figure 1) were used in this study. The lowest height at which
the wind speed and direction are detected is 110 m, and the vertical
resolution below 1,500 m is approximately 60 m. The radio-
acoustic sounding system (RASS) attached to the radar has a
virtual temperature measurement function, with a minimum
detection
height
of
180 m
and
vertical
resolution
of
approximately
60 m.
We
also
used
the
wind
speed,
air
temperature, relative humidity, and air pressure data obtained
by an automatic meteorological station located at the airport. To
maintain
consistency
with
the
RASS
observations,
the
air
temperature, relative humidity, and air pressure data were used
to calculate the near-surface virtual temperatures. Through this
conversion, the thermal environment at the ground level and that
at upper level are comparable. Additionally, to cover observation
blind spots below 110 and 180 m, linear interpolation was
conducted using observation data from the automatic station
and data obtained at the lowest height from the wind proﬁler,
which provided information between the land surface and lowest
detection height. The data used in this study were collected from

1 January 2011 to 30 December 2020, with a data collection
frequency of 1 h.
To ensure the accuracy of the observation data, the sensitivity,
dynamic range, and speed of the wind proﬁler were calibrated
monthly. Further quality controls were conducted prior to
statistical analysis. Based on historical climate records where the
observation equipment is located, wind speeds exceeding 70 m/s
were considered as questionable and excluded from further
analysis. Virtual temperature observations below −30°C and
above 60°C were also treated as erroneous data. When more
than 50% of the data for a particular time were erroneous or
missing, the data of that time were not included in the analysis.
When less than 50% of the data that should have been available for
a period were erroneous or missing, linear interpolation or
extrapolation was conducted.
In statistical analysis, we focused on the annual and monthly mean
virtual temperatures and wind speeds at various heights and evaluated
their inter-annual changes. Previous studies conﬁrmed that low-level
jets (LLJ) in this region signiﬁcantly inﬂuence O3 pollution; thus, we
also analysed changes in LLJ (Yang et al., 2022).
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Virtual temperature
Urbanisation has the most notable climatic effect on virtual
temperature. According to Li et al. (2021a), the warming rate
between 1971 and 2020 in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao
Greater Bay Area, where the PRE is located, was approximately
0.2°C/decade. In cities with particularly rapid urbanisation, such
as Shenzhen, the rate of warming was even higher, as a remarkable
80% of warming is caused by urbanisation. Using the data from
the wind proﬁler to analyse changes in the upper level virtual
temperature at the 10-year scale can improve the understanding of
how urbanisation inﬂuences thermal environment in the vertical
direction. Notably, because the elements observed by the RASS
module of the wind proﬁler are virtual temperatures, our analysis
was performed based on virtual temperatures. We added a
correction
term
for
speciﬁc
humidity,
causing
virtual
temperature
to
be
slightly
higher
than
the
original
air
temperature.

3.1.1 Mean annual values
Changes in the mean annual virtual temperature in the upper level
based on the wind proﬁler observation data are shown in Figure 2. The
mean annual virtual temperature increased throughout the upper level
below 1,200 m. Notably, the part of the upper level atmosphere where
the mean annual virtual temperature was above 26°C constantly
increased. In 2011, no part of the upper level atmosphere had a
mean annual virtual temperature of 26°C, whereas by 2020, the part of
the upper level atmosphere with a mean annual virtual temperature of
26°C extended from the ground level to above 400 m. Previous studies
of warming in the PRD region were almost exclusively ground-based
(Chan et al., 2012); however, our wind proﬁler data suggest that
warming in this region can be detected throughout the upper level
atmosphere. In another study, Li et al. (2015) analysed warming of the
surface air temperature in Shenzhen based on data from the Shenzhen
Caiwuwei Meteorological Station from 1968 to 2013 and showed that
previously rapid temperature increases slowed during the mid-2000s
as the structure of the urban built-up area became more settled. In
contrast, our results indicate that local warming has very signiﬁcantly
increased on the 10-year scale (between 2011 and 2020).
3.1.2 Mean monthly values
Changes in the mean monthly virtual temperatures in the upper
level during the 10-year study period are shown below (Figure 3). A
special coloured isoline design was used in the ﬁgure to intuitively
illustrate the intervals and changes between cold and warm virtual
temperatures. Shades of blue indicate virtual temperatures below 18°C,
whereas shades of red represent virtual temperatures above 20°C.
Before 2017, cool isolines are shown throughout the upper level
atmosphere at certain times of the year, typically from November
to February. However, after 2017, this was no longer the case, and the
heights reached by the cooler colours decreased, reﬂecting continuous
and considerable increases in the virtual temperature of the upper level
atmosphere in winter. Warming also occurred in summer, which is
reﬂected by continuous upward expansion of dark red isolines. Thus,
warming of the upper level atmosphere is evident in almost all months
of the year, though to a lesser degree in summer.
3.1.3 Warming rate
Changes in the mean virtual temperature at the ground level and
in the upper level above the land surface between 2011 and 2020 are
shown in Figure 4. The mean value for the whole upper level
atmosphere was determined as the mean value between 200 and
800 m, where the original observed data is the most complete in
the whole upper level atmosphere, and the surface level value is the
observation data obtained by the automatic meteorological station at
the airport. The annual mean warming rate of the upper level
atmosphere (0.24 °C/a) was higher than that of the land surface
(0.17°C/a). Figure 4 also shows changes in the mean virtual
temperature in different seasons, with January and December of a
given year representing winter and June and July representing
summer. Comparative analysis indicated that the warming rate of
the mean virtual temperature of the upper level atmosphere (0.10°C/a)
was similar to that of the land surface virtual temperature (0.09°C/a) in
summer. Unexpectedly, in winter, the mean virtual temperature of the
upper level atmosphere increased rapidly at a rate of 0.70°C/a, which
was much higher than that at ground level (0.47°C/a). Rapid warming
of the upper level atmosphere in winter demonstrates that temperature
inversions are more common in winter than in other seasons in the
PRE region.
Furthermore, it should be noted that both on the ground and in
the upper level atmosphere, the increase rate of virtual temperature
calculated in the current study is much higher than that of the pure air
temperature provided in previous studies (Chan et al., 2012; Li et al.,
2021a). This may be related to the increasing relative humidity in the
region over the past decade (Zhang et al., 2022). Since the virtual
temperature is equal to the sum of the air temperature and a correction
term related to the relative humidity, the rapidly increasing relative
humidity undoubtedly has a signiﬁcantly positive contribution in the
increase of the virtual temperature. However, due to the lack of long-
term relative humidity observation data in the vertical direction, it is
impossible to quantify the contribution of the increase of relative
humidity to the increase of virtual temperature, which needs further
research in the future.
3.2 Wind speed
3.2.1 Mean annual values
Changes in the mean annual wind speed recorded by the radar
wind proﬁler between 2011 and 2020 are shown in Figure 5. Although
the mean annual wind speed varied in three-to-four-year cycles, there

Li et al.
10.3389/fenvs.2022.1104553
was an overall decrease in wind speed across the upper level
atmosphere. The weak wind layer (WWL), which has a mean
annual wind speed below 2.0 m/s, increased during the study
period. Before 2016, the wind speed of the whole upper level
atmosphere almost always exceeded 2.0 m/s, with the ground-based
automatic meteorological station only occasionally recording a mean
annual wind speed below 2.0 m/s. After 2016, however, the WWL
began to appear at ground level and gradually increased in size,
reaching a height of approximately 200 m by 2018.
3.2.2 Mean monthly values
Changes in the mean monthly wind speed in the upper level are
shown in Figure 6. The inter-month ﬂuctuations were caused by
speciﬁc weather processes in each month. When typhoons, strong
cold air, strong monsoons, and other climatic events that cause
strong winds occurred, the mean monthly wind speed notably
increased. Moreover, the PRE region’s subtropical monsoon
climate led to higher mean wind speeds in summer than in
winter, as shown in Figure 6.Regardless of the inter-month
ﬂuctuations, the WWL increased overall. Before 2016, the WWL
typically only appeared for a few months of each year, whereas after
2016, the WWL appeared more frequently and its height ﬂuctuated
upwards. In the winter of 2018–2019, the WWL reached a height of
approximately 400 m.
3.2.3 Decreasing wind speed
Changes in the mean annual wind speed at the ground level and
throughout the upper level (mean wind speed of the upper level is
the mean value between 50 and 1,000 m) between 2011 and 2020 as
well as their ﬁtted linear trends are shown in Figure 7. The wind
speed at both the land surface and in the upper level ﬂuctuated
downwards. The interannual ﬂuctuations in the land surface wind
speed were minor, with a decrease of −0.05 m/s a. In contrast,
interannual ﬂuctuations in the wind speed in the upper level were
more severe, and the downward trend was more notable,
reaching −0.12 m/s a; Figure 7 also shows the mean wind speeds
in winter (January and December of each year) and summer (June
and July), during which the decrease in wind speed was more
signiﬁcant in winter than in summer. The decreases in the surface
and upper level wind speeds in winter were −0.07 and −0.19 m/s·a,
respectively. In summer, the decrease in wind speeds were −0.04 m/
s a at both the surface and upper level atmosphere.
The decrease in wind speed in the upper level and rising WWL
reveal the inﬂuence of urbanisation on the wind speed. Between
2011 and 2020, because of the increase in high-rise buildings in the

PRE, surface roughness continuously increased, leading to the loss
of kinetic energy of wind in the upper level and a continuous
decrease in the wind speed. Crucially, this effect was not limited to
the near surface but rather occurred throughout the upper level
atmosphere. Unexpectedly, the impact on the overall wind speed in
the upper level atmosphere was greater than that on the land
surface.
3.2.4 LLJ
Recent studies showed that LLJ inﬂuence the atmospheric
environment in the PRD (Yang et al., 2022). Particularly at
night, turbulent vertical mixing associated with LLJ can alter the
structure of the residual layer, leading to abnormally high O3
concentrations at night at ground level. Thus, we also analysed
changes in LLJ.
Based on a previous study by Whiteman et al. (1997), we
calculated the frequencies of three different intensities of LLJ
based on the criteria shown in Table 1, the results of which are
shown in Figure 8. Between 2011 and 2020, LLJ of various
intensities decreased overall in the PRE. Comparison of winter
and summer months showed that the decrease in LLJ was more
notable in winter than in summer. This result is consistent with the
trends observed for urbanisation-induced warming, which were
also
more
notable
in
winter.
LLJ
typically
require
stable
temperature stratiﬁcation. During the decade of the study
period, the rapid rise in winter virtual temperatures throughout
the upper level atmosphere over the PRE destabilized the
temperature stratiﬁcation in winter, preventing the occurrence
of LLJ.
3.3 Possible causes of climate change in the
upper level atmosphere
Based on the above analysis, several urbanisation-related factors
inﬂuenced the climate in the upper level atmosphere over the PRE: 1)
virtual temperature increases, particularly in winter; 2) greater
warming in the upper level than that at the ground level; 3) a
signiﬁcant decrease in wind speed and an increase in the height of
the WWL; and 4) a decrease in the LLJ frequency, particularly in
winter.
Following 30 years of extremely rapid urbanisation, the overall
structure of the built-up area of the PRE became relatively settled in
the period 2010–2020. Li et al. (2022) demonstrated that the built-up
area in Shenzhen has expanded very little since 2010. Nevertheless, the
climate of the region’s upper level atmosphere has changed
signiﬁcantly since 2010, which is somewhat unexpected. Studies of
the region’s urban development can explain this discrepancy to some
extent. Data from statistical yearbooks reveals that the urban
population of Shenzhen, where the radar wind proﬁler is located,
continued to increase rapidly after 2010 by 7.2618 million residents, or
approximately 70%, between 2010 and 2020. Furthermore, the
Shenzhen Basic Ecological Control Line was introduced in around
2006 to prevent the built-up urban area from encroaching on
ecological spaces. As a result of this regulation, expansion of
Shenzhen’s built-up area was negligible between 2010 and 2020. To
accommodate the growing population and required development
space, the city grew vertically. According to local news media,
Shenzhen had 158 skyscrapers above 200 m as of October 2021,
which is more than in any other city worldwide. In 2018, local

media reported that Shenzhen had just 96 skyscrapers of this size.
Although these data were from non-governmental sources, they
conﬁrm the rapid growth in the number of high-rise buildings in
Shenzhen. The construction of large numbers of high-rise buildings
signiﬁcantly increased the roughness of the region and anthropogenic
heat emitted into the upper level atmosphere, resulting in a rapid
increase in the air temperature of the upper level over the 10-year
study period and rapid decrease in the mean wind speed.
When trying to explain the causes of climate change in the
vertical direction by using the increase of skyscrapers, another
problem arises, namely, why the impact of the increase of the
number of skyscrapers is more obvious in the higher elevation?
While this can be explained by the footprint theory of ﬂux
observation (Zhang et al., 2015). According to the footprint
theory on atmospheric observation, the higher the observation
height, the larger the range represented by the observational data.
In the current study, the data observed by ground level automatic
weather station (AWS) only represent local information, while the
data detected at high altitude usually have a larger range of
representativeness. In this study, the AWS is located in an
airport. In order to ensure the safety of aircrafts taking off and
landing, there are strict restrictions on the height of buildings
around the airport. Therefore, the data observed by the AWS
mainly reﬂects the local climate characteristics of low-density
built-up areas similar to the suburbs. While at high altitudes,
the observational data are representative in a much larger range
due to the advection transportation and turbulent mixing of energy
and mass. Under such conditions, the impact of high-rise buildings
in urban built-up areas far away from the airport may gradually
emerge. This is possibly the reason why the impact of the increase
of the number of skyscrapers is more obvious in the higher
elevation.
3.4 Potential impact on the atmospheric
environment
These changes in the climate of the upper level atmosphere will
clearly impact regional pollution and meteorological conditions.
Based on previous studies, we can infer the following. 1) Warmer
environment will lead to the production of O3, and gradually rising
virtual temperatures in the region will create more favourable
conditions for O3 production. Particularly, the increase in the
virtual temperature throughout the upper level atmosphere
increases the vertical area suitable for O3 production. 2) The
dominant wind direction in winter in the PRE is northerly,
which causes inﬂow of inland pollutants or precursors to the
PRE, and the rapid increase in winter virtual temperatures may
adversely affect O3 pollution in the PRE. 3) In winter, the virtual
temperature increases more in the upper level atmosphere than at
the ground level, thereby enhancing the temperature inversion and
hindering the diffusion of pollutants. 4) The rapid decrease in the
upper level wind speed and continuous rise in the WWL hinders
the dilution and diffusion of pollutants, leading to deterioration of
the atmospheric environment. The overall mean wind speed in
winter is lower than that in summer in the PRE, and the greater
decrease in wind speed in winter is unfavorable to the atmospheric
environment. 5) A reduction in the LLJ frequency may reduce the
probability of O3 pollution at night.
4 Conclusions and discussion
We used observation data from a boundary layer radar wind
proﬁler, RASS, and automatic meteorological station at Shenzhen
Bao’an International Airport to analyse changes in the wind speed and
virtual temperature in the upper level over the PRE between 2011 and
2020. The climate of the upper level atmosphere over the PRE is
undergoing large and rapid changes.
At the decadal scale, the virtual temperature and wind speed in
the upper level atmosphere over the PRE changed signiﬁcantly and
to a greater extent than those at ground level. Between 2011 and
2020, the linear warming rate of the mean virtual temperature in
the upper level atmosphere was 0.24°C/a, whereas the land surface
warming rate was 0.17°C/a. Furthermore, the mean wind speed
decreased by −0.12 and −0.05 m/s a throughout the upper level
atmosphere and at ground level, respectively. Comparison of
different seasons showed that both wind speed and virtual
temperature
in
the
upper
level
atmosphere
changed
more
quickly in winter than in summer.
Climate change in the upper level atmosphere over the PRE
may affect the region’s atmospheric environment. A rapid increase
in the virtual temperature in the upper level atmosphere creates an
environment conducive to O3 production, whereas a decrease in

the wind speed reduces the dilution and diffusion of pollutants,
which
negatively
affects
the
atmospheric
environment.
Particularly, in winter, the rapid increase in virtual temperature
causes more pronounced temperature inversions, which together
with a notable decrease in the wind speed worsen the atmosphere’s
diffusion capability. The probability of LLJ in the upper level
atmosphere is also reduced by warming and increased ground
roughness, leading to decreased O3 pollution at night.
These ﬁndings improve the understanding of the effects of rapid
urbanisation on the climate in the upper level above ground and can
guide urban planning, management, and development models.
