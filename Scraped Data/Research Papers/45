Abstract: In this work, the structural, electronic, and optical stability properties of the chitosan
monomer (M-Ch) and atomic silver complex are reported, as well as a unitary cell of a silver cluster
in the gas phase and acetic acid. The generalized gradient approximation HSEh1PBE/def2-TZVPP50
results established the structures’ anionic charge (Q = −1|e|) and the doublet state (M = 2). The high
cohesive energy indicates structural stability, and the quantum-mechanical descriptors show a high
polarity and low chemical reactivity. Also, the quantum-mechanical descriptors present a low work
function that shows the structures are suitable for applications in light-emitting diodes. Finally, the
electronic behavior observed by the |HOMO-LUMO| gap energy changes depending on the atomic
silver incorporated into the complex.

1. Introduction
Presently, many polymers, among them biopolymers, have relevance within medicine,
biochemistry, genetics, and materials engineering, due to their applications as ﬁbers, adhe-
sives, etc. These biopolymers are classiﬁed into polysaccharides (starch, chitin, chitosan,
cellulose, and its derivatives), proteins (amino acids, enzymes, and peptides), and polynu-
cleotides (polyesters of phosphoric acid and nucleotides). Because of this, the number of
studies about biopolymers has increased to ﬁnd or improve applications [1].
The scientiﬁc community’s attention is focused on ﬁnding natural resources to im-
prove human health and wellness by investigating the reuse of seafood waste, e.g., the
exoskeletons of crustaceans and ﬁsh scales. This seafood waste is considered an environ-
mental pollutant. Nevertheless, it is the primary source of two worldwide value-added
biopolymers, chitin and chitosan [2], with chitosan the most abundant on Earth owing to its
extraction via the deacetylation of the chitin process, and comprising the main constituent
of ﬁshing waste [3,4].
Chitosan (Ch) is a natural polysaccharide composed of β-(1-4) glucosamine and
N-acetyl glucosamine [5]. It has excellent properties, such as a chelating agent, easy-to-
form ﬁber, good biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, antibacteriality, and good
anti-hemostatic activity [6–8]. In the pharmaceutical industry, it is used as a drug-delivery
agent [9], and in the electronic industry, it is used as a microﬂuidic bio-chip, based on the
chitosan-titania composite [10].
Metallic structures (Cu, Au, Pt, Cd, and Ag) and metallic structures combined with
polymers have been employed to design and develop bionanosensors [11–13] to prepare

medical, catalytic, and optical equipment [14,15]. The most studied are silver (Ag) nanopar-
ticles, which are used as stabilizers, composites, biosensors, and antimicrobial agents, and
for drug delivery [16–18], because of their potential absorption behavior [19]; Ag nanoparti-
cles have even been used for cancer treatment. However, healthy cells undergo unfavorable
effects when nanoparticles are below 20 nm [19,20]. Silver nanoparticles also present elec-
tronic and conductivity properties [21,22], but there needs to be more research into the
electronic properties of silver nanoparticles and their interaction with chitosan (Ag–Ch).
Therefore, this work analyzes the effect of the silver atom adsorption and a silver cluster on
the chitosan monomer using Density Functional Theory to ﬁnd potential applications.
2. Computational Aspects
The free software ArgusLab 4.0.1 was used to build geometrical atomic positions.
Subsequently, Density Functional Theory (DFT) [23] was used to study the interaction
between silver atoms (Ag), silver clusters (denoted by c and with a unitary cell composed
of 14 atoms), and the chitosan monomer (MCh). For the analysis of the chitosan monomer,
the HSEh1PBE functional [24,25] and the set 6-311G(d,p) basis were used (see Table A1).
At the same time, the optimization process of the complex formed by the Ag and the
MCh was carried out using two approaches. The ﬁrst consisted of looking for the most
stable conﬁguration given the minimum energy criterion, where seven possible interaction
conﬁgurations were analyzed considering the main functional groups of the monomer;
this was carried out at the level of generalized gradient approximation with the hybrid
functional HSEh1PBE and a DGDZVP basis set [26,27], as implemented in the GAUSSIAN
09 quantum chemistry software version 9.0 [28].
The charge and multiplicity (M = 2ST + 1, where ST is the total spin) for chitosan were
neutral and 1 (singlet state), respectively. By contrast, for the MCh–Ag complex, a neutral
charge and multiplicity of 2 were considered. For the ﬁrst structure (Q1) analyzed, silver is
oriented towards the amino group of the monomer (N: blue sphere, C: gray sphere, O: red
sphere, and H: white sphere, Figure 1a); in the second structure (Q2), the silver atom was
positioned in the OH–CH functional group attached to the oxygen atom of the hexagonal
ring (Figure 1b). In the third (Q3) and fourth (Q4) structures, the Ag atom is positioned on
the opposite side of Q2 and onto the OH–CH group on the hexagonal ring (Figure 1c,d).
The ﬁfth structure (Q5) indicates that the Ag atom is positioned on the CH2–OH functional
group of the MCh (Figure 1e). Finally, in the Q6 and Q7 systems (Figure 1f,g), the silver
atom is positioned above and below the chitosan monomer hexagonal ring. In a second
process, the effect of the charge (anion and cation) and the multiplicity (M = 2) for each
system were analyzed in order not to ﬁnd degenerate states concerning the energy of
each system (Table A2). Also, the effect of a cluster of Ag atoms as an FCC unit cell
interacting with MCh was studied. It is worth mentioning that the silver cluster was chosen
considering an embryo in the crystalline phase, emulating a natural system situation at the
nanometric level. However, there are reports in the literature where different clusters are
studied [29–31], and the crystalline case has yet to be reviewed at this level of theory.

These structures were also re-optimized at the HSEh1PBE theory level, derived from
the PBE method, and include 25% of the exact Hartree–Fock exchange. It can describe
non-covalent interactions and the more extensive def2-TZVPP basis set [32] because this
basis set describes organometallic with 4d and 5d elements very well. Also, in this way, to
guarantee the determination of local minima, vibrational calculations within the harmonic
approximation were carried out for the lowest energy structures, obtaining positive values.
The systems presenting the lowest total energies are shown in Table A2.
A more detailed study has analyzed the quantum descriptors within the DFT frame-
work [33]. The electronic energy gap (∆Egap) was considered to be the energetic difference
of the frontier orbitals—LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) and HOMO (highest
occupied molecular orbital)—as follows: ∆Egap = (εLUMO − εHOMO)/2 ≈ |εLUMO − εHOMO|.
The chemical potential, µ, a measure of global chemical reactivity, was estimated as the
µ = (εHOMO + εLUMO)/2) arithmetic mean [34]. For the design of optoelectronic devices,
essential to obtain the work function (WF) [35], this parameter is deﬁned as the minimum
energy needed to remove an electron from a solid to a point immediately outside the solid
surface or needed to move an electron from the Fermi energy level into the vacuum. The
work function (WF) was estimated as the difference between the potential energy of the
empty LUMO level and the Fermi energy (or chemical potential). The cohesion energy of
these structures was determined as follows: ECoh = ET(C6H13NO5Ag14) − kET(Carbon) −
pET(Nitrogen) − nET(Hydrogen) − gET(Silver)/(k + p + n + g), where ET represents the
total energy for the most stable structure of a system (for Q = 0 and multiplicity = 1). ET (car-
bon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and silver) represents the total energy for the ground state of the
carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and silver atoms. The labels k, p, and g represent the amount
of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and silver atoms in the structures [36]. The MEP (Molecular
Electrostatics Potentials) surfaces were determined as described in the literature [37]. These
surfaces are usually associated with lone pairs of the more electronegative atom.
To obtain more realistic results, the systems were investigated in the presence of
acetic acid simulated with the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) using one acetic acid
dielectric constant (ε = 6.2528), as implemented in software GAUSSIAN 09 [28]
3. Results and Discussion
The results of chitosan and the complex formed by chitosan and silver were analyzed
as follows: ﬁrst, it was investigated whether a signiﬁcant effect to consider in the chitosan
monomer or dimer (Figure 2) is present. Second, the analysis of the seven possible interac-
tion conﬁgurations of chitosan with atomic silver was carried out under the criterion of
minimum energy, as indicated in the methodological section; in addition, a cluster of silver
interacting with the chitosan monomer and the effect on the systems of the acid medium
(acetic acid, pH = 4.8) was analyzed.

Figure 2. Optimized structures of (a) Chitosan monomer and (b) Chitosan dimer with HOMO and
LUMO iso-surfaces, respectively.
Figure 2a,b show the optimized geometries of the chitosan monomer (MCh) and its
dimer (DCh). For both structures, it was found that the minimum energy is for the neutral
charge (Q = 0) and singlet multiplicity (M = 1); see Table A1. Only an increase of 0.132,
0.07, 0.14, 0.10, and 0.21 percentages of the C–C, C–N, C–O, N–H, and O–H bonds were
observed in the analysis of the structural properties. The bond angles showed a signiﬁcant
change of approximately 1–2 degrees on average for the C–C–O, C–O–C, C–O–H, H–N–H,
and N–C–H angles (Table 1). On the other hand, the numerical value of the polarity of both
structures indicates their highly polar character—for DCh with a value of 6.98 D and higher
than the MCh (3.59 D). This is due to the presence of a second amino group in the dimer.
One quantum parameter that indicates qualitative electronic behavior is the energy
gap (∆Egap); for both, the insulator character is presented with a value of 7.0 eV. At the
same time, a high chemical reactivity value is because the chemical potential for both DCh
and MCh is less than −5.0 eV (Table 1).
Both structures present high stability (cohesion energy: MCh= −5.4 eV/atom and
DCh = −5.5 eV/atom), the dimer being more stable by 0.1 eV. These results are close to
those reported by Upma et al. [38], who studied the effect of cohesion energy on the position
of the amino functional group in the DCh. However, this study showed that at this level of
theory, the MCh also presents good structural stability. In the same context, the vibrational
analysis of both chemical species indicates that they are stable, since no complex frequency
is observed. Figure 3 shows the theoretical infrared spectra, where the peaks are located in
the following ranges: 3680–3711 cm−1, 3620–3590 cm−1, 3520–3500 cm−1, 3140–2900 cm−1,
1665–1650 cm−1, 1460–1400 cm−1, and 1390–1200 cm−1 are associated with the stretching
of the O–H, asymmetric stretching of the H–N–H, and symmetric stretching of the H–N–H,
the stretching of C–H, H–N–H scissoring, the O–H and C–H outer chain rocking link, and
O–H and C–H internal chain rocking-type vibrational modes, respectively [39,40].

The peak located from 1150 to 1000 cm−1 shows a wagging movement of the C–C–C
and for the O–C–C link of the hexagonal ring; on the other hand, the wagging mode of the
H–N–H and rocking motions of the H–C–H appear at 884 cm−1 for the MCh (Figure 3a)
and 913 cm−1 (Figure 3b) for the DCh. Finally, a small peak in the 590–300 cm−1 range,
distinctive of the O–H group and the twisting type, can be seen. The work function value in
both structures is high, 3.50 and 3.59 eV, for the MCh and DCh, respectively, so it is unlikely
that a photocurrent will occur.
3.1. Structural and Electronic Properties of Chitosan–Silver Complex
Figure 4 presents the geometric conﬁguration vs. relative energy concerning more
negative energy conﬁguration; we can observe the minimal energy state. Therefore, the
more stable structure is Q1, because it has 0.061 eV less than the Q4 and Q5 structures,
where the Ag atom interacts with the amine group from chitosan. These results agree with
reports in the literature where the interaction of metallic atoms such as Cu and Na are
carried out by said amino functional group, as reported [41,42].

Figure 4. Geometrical configuration vs. relative energy of chitosan monomer and silver atom interaction.
The re-optimized structures under the def2-TZVPP50 basis set of MCh–Ag and
MCh–Ag–c are shown in Figure 5; both systems ﬁnd the energy minimum on the an-
ionic charge potential energy surface (Q = −1|e|) and multiplicity 1 and 2, respec-
tively (Table A2), with an adsorption energy of −1.63 eV for MCh–Ag and −2.45 eV for
MCh–Ag–c, indicating that the Ag chemically adsorbs the MCh in both systems (Table 1).
The structural parameters, such as bond length and bond angle of the MCh–Ag and
MCh–Ag–c complexes are also shown in Table 1, and only a slight change of 1.0% in the
bond length of the N–H and O–H in the case of MCh–Ag concerning MCh–Ag–c. On the
other hand, the dipole moment compared to the chitosan monomer (3.45 D) increases for
MCh–Ag (7.1 D). It decreases for the MCh–Ag–c system (2.17 D), maintaining the covalent
character, which implies that there is a charge transfer from silver to the chitosan monomer
(Table 1) and through the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis images of Figure 6, said
charge transfer is approximately 0.071|e|, concentrating on the hexagonal ring of the MCh.
However, according to the chemical stability determined by the cohesion energy, it can
be observed that the two systems are less stable than the isolated species, i.e., the MCh;
however, both structures are highly stable, because the numerical values for MCh–Ag and
MCh–Ag–c are −5.26 and −4.101 eV/atom, respectively (Table 1).

The infrared spectra calculated from MCh–Ag and MCh–Ag–c complex vibrational
analysis are shown in Figure 7. We cannot observe any complex frequency indicating
that both systems are stable in the gas phase. Figure 7a shows the IR spectrum of the
MCh–Ag system where the O–H, N–H, and C–H stress-type modes are located at 3835 cm−1,
3551 cm−1, and 3022–3125 cm−1, respectively.

However, when the MCh interacts with the Ag atoms (MCh–Ag–c) cluster, the O–H
tension shifts to higher wave numbers of 45 cm−1. Although the C–H tension undergoes
a shift to lower wave numbers (Figure 7b), both systems present a high-intensity peak
located at 3241 cm−1 for the MCh–Ag and 3607 cm−1 MCh–Ag–c due to the interaction
of the O–H functional group of the MCh hexagonal ring and N–H with the silver; these
results conﬁrm the experimental studies by An et al. [43] where it is mentioned that both
the amino group of MCh and OH functional group interact with the silver atom.
On the other hand, the deformation rocking vibration modes of the O–H and the
C–H of the MCh–Ag are located in the ranges 1321–1424 cm−1 and 1431–1403 cm−1 of the
MCh–Ag and MCh–Ag–c complex, respectively, while the twisting vibrational mode due to
the H–N–H, O–C–H are between 1128 and 1075 cm−1, and the intense peaks are due to the
interaction with Ag and MCh with the respective wagging movement of the H–N–H bond
located at 925 and 934 cm−1, for the MCh–Ag and 3607 cm−1 and MCh–Ag–c, respectively.
A small peak in the 469–411 cm−1 range is due to a combined rocking movement of the
C–H–N–H and O–H, twisting of the OH–C, and wagging C–O–H to MCh–Ag–c, while
MCh–Ag is located at 445 cm−1.
Regarding the electronic properties of the MCh–Ag and MCh–Ag–c complex shown
in Table 1, it can be seen that chitosan undergoes a transition in its electronic behavior
from an insulator to a semiconductor-like character when it interacts with the Ag due to
the ∆Egap value. For the MCh–Ag, it is 3.1 eV, and for the MCh–Ag–c, it is 0.55 eV. In
comparison, the MCh has a gap of 7.18 eV; this can be explained by Figure 5a,b, where the
density of the HOMO is Ryd(3p) type for MCh–Ag (more signiﬁcant contribution of s-type
orbitals of Ag and p-character orbitals of N and O) and Ryd (5d) type for MCh–Ag–c (more
outstanding contribution of d-type orbitals from Ag). At the same time, the LUMO is of
the Cor(1S) MCh–Ag type (contribution of p-type orbitals from both silver and O and N)
and other Cor(3d) type (contribution of d-type orbitals of both silver and O and N) and are
concentrated on the silver cluster, which explains the reduction of said value of the energy
gap [44]. On the other hand, since the MCh–Ag–c system was stabilized in anionic charge
(Q = −1|e|) and multiplicity 2, this system presents magnetic properties, with a magnetic
moment of 1.0 µB, where the silver atoms are primarily responsible for magnetism. This
can be conﬁrmed by the spin density surface images shown in Figure 8a.
Figure 8. Spin density surface (0.004) for acetic acid systems: (a) MCh–Ag–cluster complex and
(b) The MCh–Ag–c–Solv.
The chemical reactivity determined by the value of the chemical potential of the
MCh–Ag is 2.21 eV, while for the MCh–Ag–c it is −1.16 eV. It increases, compared to the
MCh. These results support those already reported in the literature, where it is mentioned
that the chitosan biopolymer involves silver nanoparticles [45,46]. In the case of the work
function, its value is reduced to 0.05 eV for the MCh–Ag system and 0.85 eV for the
Molecules 2023, 28, 5809
11 of 18
MCh–Ag–c system (Table 1) compared to the chitosan monomer, indicating that these
systems are suitable for the development of light-emitting diode systems. Additionally, the
MEP iso-surface obtained by the Jmol program [47] (Figure 9a) of the structures shows us
that the zone of most remarkable reactivity with a concentration of electric charge is in the
silver atoms, which indicates that this zone is nucleophilic in both systems.

phase and (b) Acetic acid.
3.2. Effects of Solvent (Acetic Acid) on Chitosan–Silver Complex
The known effect of the acid medium on the complex formed by the silver cluster
and the MCh in situ synthesis methods of silver nanostructures when the acid dissolves
chitosan to conform biopolymer ﬁlms with silver nanostructures is being developed experi-
mentally [48].
A signiﬁcant structural effect can be observed due to acetic acid on the MCh–Ag and
MCh–Ag–c complexes, as shown in Figure 5b,d, i.e., it can be seen in Table 1 that this acid
medium causes the attractive energy of both atomic silver and the silver cluster on the
MCh to increase by 54% (for the MCh–Ag, the Ead = −1.63 eV) and 30% for MCh–Ag–c
with Ead = −3.53 eV. This is because acetic acid gives chitosan the chelating character to be
able to wrap both atomic silver and the cluster to stabilize the silver [49].

The MCh–Ag–c–Solv system, as in the case of the gas phase, presents magnetic
properties with a magnetic moment of 1.0 µB, where the spin density is located mainly in
the silver atoms and partially in the O atoms of the monomer (Figure 8b). The monomer
structure was somewhat altered, presenting a reduction of 0.65, 1.55, and 3.8% in the C–C,
N–H, and OH bond lengths, respectively, due to the 3% increase for the C–O bond lengths,
compared to the MCh (the bond angles do not present signiﬁcant alteration, Table 1). The
dipole moments for the systems increase by 9.96 D for the MCh–Ag–Solv system, and 2.97
for MCh–Ag–c–Solv compared to the gas-phase system, and, due to the charge transfer of
0.08|e| silver, is given in the direction of the atom towards chitosan, concentrating on the
amino group (Figure 10).
Figure 10. Dipole moment vector and calculated from charge NBO analysis showing charge trans-
ferring around the acetic acid systems of (a) Chitosan monomer–single silver atom complex with
solvent and (b) Chitosan monomer–cluster silver complex with solvent.
Vibrational analysis shows that both systems are stable as they do not present negative
vibration frequencies. Figure 11a shows the IR spectrum of the MCh–Ag–Solv system,
which shows that the tension vibration modes of O–H, N–H, and C–H are in the ranges
of 3836–3730 cm−1, 3385 cm−1, and 3002–3101 cm−1, respectively. However, when the
MCh interacts with an Ag cluster (MCh–Ag–c–Solv), the O–H and H–N–H tensions shift
to higher wavenumbers; i.e., they are located at 3811 cm−1 and 3599 cm−1, while the

C–H tension undergoes a shift to lower wavenumbers in both systems (Figure 11a,b). The
IR spectra show peaks as more intense at 3385 cm−1 and 3599 cm−1 of symmetric and
asymmetric tension for NH and OH interactions with a silver atom. This is due to the
acetic acid solvent. The deformation vibrational modes for the MCh–Ag–Solv system are
found in the regions 1299–1441, 1150–1069, 920, 506–347, and 269 cm−1 associated with
C–H and O–H rocking, H–N–H twisting, H–N–H wagging, a combination of H–N–H–C
twisting and C–O–H rocking, and C–O–H wagging, respectively (Figure 11a). In the same
sense, the deformation modes of the MCh–Ag–c–Solv system (Figure 11b) are located
at 1430–1403 cm−1 for C–H and O–H rocking, 1113–1065 cm−1 of O–C–H and H–N–H
twisting, and N–H rocking, 928 cm−1 for H–N–H wagging interaction with a silver atom,
and ﬁnally in the interval 420–375 cm−1 due to a combination between C–NH2, OH rocking,
H–N–H twisting, N–H rocking, and the C–O–H wagging functional group.

Regarding the electronic properties, the MCh–Ag–Solv and MCh–Ag–c–Solv systems
present a semiconductor character because the ∆Egap value is 3.64 eV and 0.48 eV, re-
spectively; this is because, like the systems in the gas phase, the densities of the HOMO
and LUMO orbitals are distributed over the silver atoms (see Figure 5b,d). The chemical
reactivity given by the value of the chemical potential indicates that acetic acid increases
the chemical reactivity by 3% for MCh–Ag–Solv and 70% for MCh–Ag–c–Solv, indicating
that this acid medium promotes an increase in charge transfer in the systems (Table 1).
The cohesion energy of the systems both in the gas phase and in acetic acid indicates
that stability tends to increase with the addition of a metallic silver cluster and with the
solvent (Table 1). Finally, the work function is altered for the MCh–Ag–c–Solv with an
increase of 1.59 eV and 3.21 eV to MCh–Ag–Solv compared to the gas-phase systems. Still,
it maintains an excellent optical activity to the ﬂow of electrons. The iso-surface MEPs, like
the gas-phase systems (Figure 9b), show us that the nucleophilic area is in the silver atoms.
4. Conclusions
DFT calculations were used to study the structural, electronic, and optical properties
of the MCh–Ag and MCh–Ag–c systems with the chemical composition C6O5H13N–Ag
and C6O5H13N–Ag14, respectively, and the effect of acetic acid as a solvent medium. The
structural stability of the systems is high and increases with the impact of acetic acid. Our
results agree that chitosan has already been experimentally reported as a stabilizing agent
for silver nanostructures. According to their quantum descriptors, it was found through
the analysis of the global chemical potential that the systems have moderate chemical
reactivity and high polarity, so these systems can be considered feasible for the design of
light-emitting diodes. In the same way, the design of optoelectronic devices using these
systems can occur because they present a moderate value of work function. On the other
hand, the doublet state of the C6O5H13N–Ag14 complex in the gas phase and with a solvent
such as acetic acid suggests that the system may have potential use for removing metal
ions with ferromagnetic properties. The systems can even be used as nucleophilic agents
since the MEP iso-surfaces show that the negative charge is concentrated in the silver atom.
