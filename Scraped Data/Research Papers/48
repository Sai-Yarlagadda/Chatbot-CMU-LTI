Abstract
Significance: Leakage in the interfaces between restorative materials and tooth structure allows
for fluid and bacterial acid infiltration, causing restoration failure due to secondary caries.
Dentists spend more time replacing composite restorations than placing new ones. Previous
in vitro and in vivo studies on enamel and root surfaces using shortwave-infrared (SWIR) and
thermal imaging during dehydration with forced air have been promising for assessing lesion
activity.
Aim: We hypothesized that SWIR reflectance and thermal imaging methods can be used to
monitor the activity of secondary caries lesions around composite restorations. The objective
of this study was to employ these methods to measure the rate of fluid loss from lesions during
dehydration with forced air to assess lesion activity.
Approach: Sixty-three extracted human teeth with total of 109 suspected secondary lesions were
examined using SWIR and thermal imaging during dehydration. The thickness of the highly
mineralized transparent surface layer (TSL) at lesion interfaces indicative of lesion activity was
measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Micro-computed tomography (MicroCT)
was used to further confirm lesion severity and structure. OCT and MicroCT measurements
of lesion structure, depth, and severity were correlated with fluid loss rates measured with
SWIR reflectance and thermal imaging.
Results: TSL thickness measured with OCT correlated with both SWIR reflectance and thermal
measurements of rates of fluid loss (p < 0.05). Increasing TSL thickness led to decreased per-
meability of lesions, potentially indicating full lesion arrest at TSL ≥ 70 μm. SWIR performed
better than thermal imaging for secondary lesion activity assessment, although both methods
performed best on smooth surface lesions.
Conclusions: Nondestructive SWIR reflectance and OCT imaging methods are promising for
clinically monitoring the activity of secondary caries lesions.

1 Introduction
In recent years, the prevalence of using shade-matched and radiopaque dental restorative materi-
als for replacing decayed tooth structure after cavity preparation has led to a marked increase in
the formation of secondary caries lesions. Dentists now spend more time replacing failed resto-
rations than placing new ones. Maladaptation of bonding materials to tooth structure permits the
microleakage of fluids and bacterial acid, resulting in the demineralization of tooth structure
extending beneath the restoration. Clinicians are trained to rely on tactile sensation via the dental

explorer and visual inspection to determine whether the decay is active or arrested.1 Such meth-
ods that rely on texture and color are highly subjective and unreliable.2 Often tooth structure is
heavily stained, and stain is commonly mistaken for demineralization. A major advantage of
shortwave-infrared (SWIR) imaging is that stains do not interfere at wavelengths longer than
1100 nm.3–5 Moreover, tooth-like, radiopaque restorative materials may mask secondary lesions,
further complicating their detection and diagnosis with current methods. Accurate assessment of
lesion activity, depth, and severity is important for clinicians to decide whether intervention is
necessary.
A key indicator that lesions have become arrested due to remineralization is the formation of
a highly mineralized transparent surface layer (TSL) on the outer layers of the lesions.6–14 The
presence of such a layer greatly inhibits the diffusion of fluids in and out of the lesion.
Conversely, active lesions lack such a layer and possess a much higher permeability. Hence,
the rate of water diffusion out of the lesion reflects the degree of lesion activity. Effective
employment of new optical diagnostic technologies that can exploit changes in the light scatter-
ing of sound and carious tooth structure and restorative materials have great potential for diag-
nosing the present state of secondary lesions.15
Previous studies have demonstrated that optical changes due to the loss of water from porous
lesions can be used to assess lesion severity and activity with fluorescence, SWIR, and thermal
imaging.16–22 We have investigated the use of SWIR reflectance methods to indirectly assess
water diffusion rates from lesions because the porosity of the outer layers of active lesions
is significantly greater than for arrested lesions.20,23–25 Sound enamel appears transparent in
SWIR wavelengths, whereas early demineralization increases SWIR scattering and reflectance.
The incident SWIR light is absorbed by the water in the pores at the lesion surface, particularly at
wavelengths such as 1460 and 1950 nm that coincide with water molecular absorption bands,
thereby reducing surface scattering and lesion contrast. Water loss from pores in the lesion dur-
ing lesion dehydration produces a marked increase in reflectivity and lesion contrast. Previous
studies have shown great potential for SWIR reflectance imaging at 1950 nm for monitoring
carious lesion activity with high sensitivity and efficacy due to the enhanced water absorption.26
Temperature changes on tooth surfaces during air drying have been exploited to assess lesion
activity via thermal imaging. Previous studies utilizing thermal imaging for assessing the activity
of lesions on coronal and root surfaces both in vivo and in vitro have shown considerable
promise.16,17,20–22 Measured temperature changes reflect the amount of water that diffuses from
pores in the lesion to evaporate from the surface.20,27 In addition, because water tends to pool in
gaps and crevices, we postulate that thermal imaging may be able to highlight gaps between
restorative materials and tooth structure where there is increased microleakage. Such areas
should experience larger temperature drops due to greater water retention in such gaps. In a
recent thermal imaging study of root caries lesions, pockets in the gingiva were much cooler
than the surrounding tooth structure due to water pooling in such areas.27 Therefore, both SWIR
and thermal dehydration imaging methods have significant clinical potential for the nondestruc-
tive assessment of the activity of secondary caries lesions. Improving caries diagnosis should
reduce the unnecessary replacement of composite restorations.
Several studies have demonstrated the utility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) for
acquiring high-resolution images of lesion structure and activity in vivo.10 When used at
SWIR wavelengths, OCT is useful in determining whether lesions are active and expanding,
partially arrested and undergoing remineralization, or fully arrested and remineralized.6–8,28,29
This imaging method resolves the reflectivity of each layer of sound and lesion structures,
as well as restorative materials. OCT has also been particularly valuable for the measurement
of gaps between restorative materials and tooth structure.6,30 Most importantly, OCT can detect
the presence of a transparent zone of high mineral content at the lesion surface formed due to
remineralization, which serves as a key indicator that the lesion has become arrested. Such trans-
parent surface zones have been clearly resolved in OCT images of lesions both in vitro and in
vivo on coronal and root surfaces.9,10,27
The purpose of this study is to develop methods to assess secondary lesion activity using
SWIR, thermal imaging, and OCT. We hypothesize that lesion characteristics measured with
OCT such as lesion depth (LD), integrated reflectivity (ΔR), and thickness of the formation
of the highly mineralized TSL correlate with the lesion permeability (fluid loss rate) and activity

measured with SWIR and thermal imaging during dehydration with forced air. In this study,
OCT and micro-computed tomography (MicroCT) measurements of lesion structure, depth, and
severity were correlated with fluid loss rates measured with SWIR reflectance and thermal
imaging.
2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Sample Preparation
Sixty-three extracted human teeth collected from oral surgeons were assessed by clinicians for
suspected secondary caries lesions. These teeth were sterilized with gamma radiation, mounted
into black Delrin blocks using epoxy, and stored in a 0.1% thymol solution. Lesions on each
tooth were identified by surfaces per clinical standard, yielding a total sample size of n ¼ 109.
Figure 1 shows the workflow of the study design.
2.2 Visible (Color) Imaging
A USB-powered Model 5MP Edge AM7915MZT digital microscope from AnMO Electronics
Corp. (New Taipei City, Taiwan) equipped with eight white LED lights and a visible polarizer to
reduce glare was used to acquire 5 mega-pixel (2952 × 1944) color images of all sample
surfaces.
2.3 SWIR Reflectance Imaging at 1950 nm
Samples were stored in a moist environment to preserve internal hydration. Each sample was
immersed in a water bath and shaken to enhance water diffusion prior to measurement and then
placed into a custom fabricated sample mount. A computer-controlled air nozzle with a 1-mm
aperture was positioned 5 cm away from the sample surface at a 20-deg angle. After the sample
was removed from the water bath, an image was captured to use as an initial reference image and
the air spray was activated. Continuous pressurized air at 25 psi was delivered from the air nozzle
to dehydrate the sample as images were captured for 60 s [Fig. 2(a)]. The SWIR reflectance
imaging setup was automated using LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Austin, Texas).
A Xeva-2.35-320 extended range InGaAs SWIR T2SL camera (Xenics, Leuven, Belgium)
sensitive from 900 to 2350 nm was used to acquire SWIR reflectance images during dehydration.
The camera was equipped with two lenses, a Navitar f ¼ 35-mm SWIR optimized (f∕1.4) lens
and a 60-mm achromat lens positioned 40 mm from the 35 mm lens. A high extinction polarizer
was used to acquire cross polarization images from 1500 to 2350 nm. The quantum efficiency
peaks at 1500 nm near 65%, drops off rapidly to 30% after 1700 nm, and drops off again to
below 20% after 2000 nm.

A polarized, broadband amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) light source Model AP-ASE-
2000 from AdValue Photonics (Tucson, Arizona) with a center wavelength of 1959 nm, a band-
width of ∼100 nm (−3 dB), 230 nm (−30 dB), and an output power of 11 mW was used as the
1950 nm light source. The light source was directed at the sample at an incident angle of
∼20 deg to reduce specular reflection, and the source to sample distance was fixed at 5 cm.
SWIR reflectance images were processed and automatically analyzed using a dedicated program
constructed with LabVIEW and MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts) software. A
region of interest (ROI) encompassing the whole sample was used, and the measurement was
recorded for each time point. The mean intensities, ΔIs, were derived from the area under the
time–intensity curve

for lesion areas (ΔIL) and control areas (ΔIC). The difference and the ratio between ΔIL and ΔIC
within the same sample, denoted as ΔIL−C and ΔIL∕C, respectively, were compared to determine
which approach is most sensitive to changes in lesion activity.
2.4 Thermal Imaging
A similar dehydration setup used for SWIR imaging was used for thermal imaging. A Model
A65 infrared (IR) thermography camera from FLIR Systems (Wilsonville, Oregon) sensitive
from 7.5 to 13 μm with a resolution of 640 × 512 pixels, a thermal sensitivity of 50 mK, and
a lens with a 13-mm focal length was used to record temperature changes during the dehydration
process. The ambient room temperature, flowing air temperature, and water bath temperature
were ∼21°C (294.15 K) and were consistent throughout the experiment. The object emissivity
was set to 0.92, and the atmospheric temperature was set to 294.15 K.31 Although humidity
values were not recorded, every sample was measured under the same conditions, with the rel-
ative humidity set at a default value of 50%. Previous studies have shown that the area enclosed
by the time–temperature curve represents the amount of heat lost, ΔQ, that can be used as a
quantitative measurement of the magnitude of evaporative cooling or amount of fluid loss that
is indirectly related to the lesion structure and permeability.16,17,20 Thermal images were proc-
essed and analyzed using dedicated programs written in LabVIEW and MATLAB. ΔQ was
calculated and recorded as

for lesion areas (ΔQL) and control areas ðΔQC). The difference and the ratio between ΔQL and
ΔQC within the same sample, denoted as ΔQL−C and ΔQL∕C, respectively, were compared.

Similar considerations as comparing ΔIs warranted us to account for variations in temperature
change throughout dehydration in comparing ΔQs.
2.5 Optical Coherence Tomography
An IVS-2000-HR-C OCT system from Santec (Komaki, Aichi, Japan) that utilizes a swept laser
source and a handpiece with a microelectromechanical scanning mirror and imaging optics was
used to acquire complete tomographic images of samples at a volume of 5 × 5 × 5 mm. The
body of the handpiece is 7 × 18 cm with an imaging tip that is 4 cm long and 1.5 cm across.
Images are captured in ∼3 s at a wavelength of 1312 nm with a bandwidth of 173 nm and a
measured resolution in air of 8.8 μm (3 dB). Measured LDs were divided by 1.6, the refractive
index of enamel. The lateral resolution is 30 μm (1∕e2) with a measured imaging depth of 5 mm
and depth resolution of 5 μm in air. Image analysis and lesion structural measurements were
carried out using Dragonfly from ORS (Montreal, Canada). Using a previously developed
processing workflow within the ORS Dragonfly environment, thresholding was performed
as image segmentation to estimate the LD, and ΔR was calculated by averaging the intensity
values across the ROI. If observed, the thickness of the TSL was also measured.
2.6 MicroCT Analysis and Evaluation
A Scanco MicroCT 50 (Wayne, Pennsylvania) located at the UCSF Bone Imaging Core Facility
was used to acquire 10 μm resolution images. Image analysis and lesion structural measurements
(LD) and surface layer (SL) thickness were carried out also using Dragonfly. A built-in median
filter at an appropriate sigma for smoothing and a Sobel-operator for edge detection were used to
determine the LD via multiple subsequent measurements using line profiles.
2.7 Data and Statistical Analysis
Microsoft Excel (Redmond, Washington) and GraphPad Prism 9 (La Jolla, California) were used
for data aggregation, analysis, and graphical presentation. Pearson’s correlation and the student
t-test were used for comparing different measurements.
3 Results
3.1 SWIR Imaging
SWIR images acquired during dehydration with forced air of a composite restoration with a
suspected lesion are shown in Fig. 3. ΔIs are represented by the areas enclosed by the
time–intensity dehydration curves. The integrated heat map allowed the operator to designate
the respective control and lesion ROIs. Across all lesion surfaces, the dehydration curves t
ypically exhibited an initial minimum at time zero as when water was present to absorb most
of the incident SWIR light. The sigmoidal increase represents both the loss of water absorption
and the increase in reflectance of porous areas of demineralization. ΔI values for each
lesion were further modified by subtracting the respective control ΔI for each tooth from the
lesion ΔI, represented as ΔIL−C, and by dividing the respective lesion ΔI by control ΔI, or
ΔIL∕C. The ΔIL−C among the lesions ranged from 1.83 × 104 to 3.16 × 106 [6.49 × 105 
6.22 × 104 (mean ± SEM)], where ΔIL∕C ranged from 1.10 to 40.3 (5.4  0.6). The SWIR
imaging protocol and the collected ΔIs were closely examined to avoid inclusion of any
composite restorations, which exhibit high intensities on SWIR reflectance, in the lesion and
the control ROIs.
3.2 Thermal Imaging
Thermal images acquired for the same composite restoration during dehydration are shown in
Fig. 4. ΔQ values are represented by the difference between the areas enclosed by the time versus

temperature dehydration curves. Across all lesion surfaces, the dehydration curves typically
exhibited an initial drop in temperature followed by a slow recovery to the ambient temperature.
An overall average dehydration curve was not derived for every lesion as each lesion behaves
differently. ΔQ values for each lesion were further modified by subtracting the respective control
ΔQ for each tooth from the lesion ΔQ, represented as ΔQL−C, and by dividing the respective

lesion ΔQ by control ΔQ, or ΔQL∕C. The ΔQL−C among the lesions ranged from 8 to 617 Ks
[193.4  13.4 Ks (mean ± SEM)], where ΔQL∕C ranged from 1.0 to 6.1 (1.7  0.1). At the
onset of dehydration for the sample in Fig. 4, the thermal image showed demarcation between
composite material and tooth structure likely because the composite surface was rougher and
retained more water after being removed from the water bath. Eventually, the thermal dehydra-
tion process was able to overcome the initial water retention and reveal the lesion area, specifi-
cally near the interface between the composite material and tooth structure. However, we
observed that, for a few samples, the dehydration process was unable to overcome the nonlesion
water retention, leading to higher ΔQs.
3.3 OCT Imaging
Sample OCT C- and B-scans for the same lesion surface are shown in Fig. 5. Estimated LDs
ranged from 22 to 340 μm [136  5 μm (mean ± SEM)]. ΔR ranged from 49 to 199 (153  3)
for all of the lesions. As expected, ΔR was higher in the lesion area compared with the sound
control area. There was a significant positive correlation between LD and ΔR (r ¼ 0.24,
p < 0.05). Of the 109 suspected lesions, 85 lesions had a detectable TSL above or within the
lesion, with thicknesses varying from 16 to 100 μm (53  2 μm).

3.4 MicroCT Imaging
A MicroCT scan for the same sample shown in Fig. 5 is shown in Fig. 6. Using a previously
developed processing workflow within the ORS Dragonfly environment, a combination of a
median filter for smoothing and a Sobel-operator for edge detection were used to process the
scans to obtain the LD. An SL for each lesion was also recorded. The LD ranged from 57 to
575 μm [235  11 μm (mean ± SEM)]. The SL thickness ranged from 10 to 154 μm
(69  2 μm).
3.5 Correlation of Thermal and SWIR Imaging with OCT and MicroCT
Measurements
For OCT measurements, there was a significant positive correlation (r ¼ 0.24, p < 0.05)
between the LD and ΔR, i.e., deeper lesions had a higher overall reflectivity. There was no
significant correlation between the LD and either thermal (ΔQ) or SWIR (ΔI) measurements.
The correlation between ΔR and ΔQ or ΔI appeared to be weakly positive; however, they were
not statistically significant. The exception was the correlation between ΔR and ΔQL∕C, in which
a significant positive relationship was observed (r ¼ 0.23, p < 0.05). On the other hand, the TSL
thickness was significantly negatively correlated with both dehydration methods; the thicker the
TSL was, the lower the dehydration values were (TSL and ΔIL−C: r ¼ −0.75, p < 0.05; TSL and
ΔQL−C: r ¼ −0.54, p < 0.05; TSL and ΔQL∕C: r ¼ −0.36, p < 0.05) [Figs. 7(a) and 7(b)]. The
exception was TSL and ΔIL∕C, in which the relationship was weakly negative but not statistically
significant (r ¼ −0.21, p > 0.05). In general, there was no significant correlation between SL
as measured by MicroCT and ΔQ or ΔI. However, there was a significant positive correlation
between TSL as measured by OCT and SL as measured by MicroCT (r ¼ 0.26, p < 0.05)
[Fig. 7(c)].
The influence of the TSL was further examined by investigating the influence of the TSL
thickness on ΔQ or ΔI. We found that, for TSL thicknesses <70 μm, there was a significant

negative correlation with most dehydration measurements (TSL and ΔIL−C: r ¼ −0.75,
p < 0.05; TSL and ΔQL−C: r ¼ −0.52, p < 0.05; TSL and ΔQL∕C: r ¼ −0.32, p < 0.05) except
for TSL and ΔIL∕C (r ¼ −0.145, p > 0.05). However, for TSLs of 70 μm or more, there was
no further increase in correlation. Unpaired t-tests further substantiated the significant differ-
ence between both dehydration values for lesions with TSL of 70 μm or less and those with
TSL of >70 μm (ΔIL−C: t ¼ 2.93, p < 0.05 (Fig. 8); ΔIL∕C: t ¼ 1.35, p < 0.05; ΔQL−C:
t ¼ 2.33, p < 0.05).
We further analyzed the dehydration measurements and the respective OCT measurements
based on lesion type: occlusal (n ¼ 11), smooth surface (consists of buccal/facial, mesial, distal,
lingual; n ¼ 69), and incisal (n ¼ 5). The correlation analysis showed that there is no significant
relationship between the TSL thickness with ΔQ and ΔI for occlusal and incisal lesions.
However, there were significant negative correlations of the TSL thickness with ΔQ and ΔI
for smooth surface lesions (TSL and ΔIL−C: r ¼ −0.78, p < 0.05; TSL and ΔQL−C: r ¼ −0.54,
p < 0.05; TSL and ΔQL∕C: r ¼ −0.38, p < 0.05) except for TSL and ΔIL∕C (r ¼ −0.22,
p > 0.05) [Figs. 9(a) and 9(b)].

4 Discussion
Several studies have demonstrated the use of thermal and SWIR imaging coupled with dehy-
dration methods to assess the permeability and level of activity of simulated and natural lesions.
This study employed similar imaging modalities to assess natural lesions surrounding composite
restorations. Previous studies on SWIR reflectance and transillumination imaging of both in vitro
and in vivo secondary caries revealed the capability for SWIR to differentiate between sound
tooth structure, lesions, and composite restorations with high contrast.15,32 In this study, SWIR
imaging at 1950 nm was advantageous for differentiating composite restorations and lesions
from sound tooth structure. Despite the complex geometry and topography in a few lesions,
SWIR reflectance imaging during dehydration was able to assess the permeability with relatively
close correlation to OCT. However, we did observe, too, that the type of restorative composite
material used and the degree of surface roughness have led to a few hyperinflated intensities
when no lesions were found in OCT or MicroCT images. Therefore, the accuracy of SWIR
dehydration imaging is highly dependent on the user’s ability to carefully designate the
ROIs for comparisons between lesion ΔIs and sound ΔIs. Any inclusion of restorative areas
in the ROIs may confound the dehydration value calculations and lead to false positives (higher
ΔI; determining a lesion as active when it is arrested).
Previous studies have demonstrated the use of thermal imaging for assessing lesion activity
in vitro and in vivo, but this is the first study to investigate its use for imaging secondary caries
lesions. An important characteristic of secondary decay is the presence of microleakage at the
interfaces between restorative materials and tooth structures. Because areas of increased water
pooling and retention yield larger drops in temperature after dehydration, we postulated that
thermal imaging is likely to yield information regarding the magnitude of microleakage.
Such water pooling has influenced thermal imaging of the pits and fissures of the occlusal
surfaces.17,21 In our study, we similarly observed such behavior for occlusal surfaces, around
cracks, and over certain restorative materials that appeared to retain more water, resulting in
higher ΔQ values when OCT and/or MicroCT images indicated lesion arrest.
Thermal imaging principally detects changes in temperature due to water evaporation, but it
inherently does not help differentiate between composite materials and tooth structures due to
similar values of thermal emissivity. Differences in the surface texture or composition of some
composite materials appear to increase water retention that enables differentiation from tooth
structure. We observed that thermal imaging worked well when any pooled water in the lesion
area was rapidly removed during dehydration to reveal the lesion area, specifically near the inter-
face between the composite material and tooth structure. In a few samples in which the forced air
was not able to rapidly remove any pooled water, false positives (higher ΔQ) were observed.
Careful examination of the imaging series was required to ensure the correct designation of
lesion and control ROIs to prevent errors in comparisons. Overall, SWIR imaging seemed to

outperform thermal imaging in this study. ΔI seemed to be less affected than ΔQ by the com-
plexities of occlusal anatomy and crevices of interfaces that tend to retain water and interfere
with thermal dehydration. Thermal dehydration showed greater variability in the measurements
compared with SWIR dehydration.
Previous studies have utilized different methods for the analysis of dehydration curves. For
SWIR reflectance measurements, we have observed that, although many lesion dehydration
curves exhibit sigmoidal growth, several lesions have yielded dehydration curves deviating from
this fit. To be more inclusive with our analyses, instead of using the simpler derivation of
ΔI ¼ ΔIt¼0 − ΔIt¼60,9,10 we chose to integrate the intensity over time. Employing two different
ways of comparing dehydration values by calculating differences and ratios between that of the
lesion and that of the control allows us to capture more information presented by the complex-
ities of lesion surfaces. Although both differences (L − C) and ratios (L∕C) of values between
the lesion and the control areas within each sample correlated with TSL thickness, L − C values
seemed to correlate more closely than L∕C. L∕C normalizes and potentially masks portions of
the dehydration curve that are attributed to the differences in permeability values between lesion
and that of control areas; hence ΔIL∕C for all secondary lesions did not significantly correlate
with TSL thickness, but ΔIL−C did.
LD did not correlate with either type of dehydration measurement, which was not surprising
and has been observed previously.9,10,21 It is likely that the changes in temperature and reflec-
tivity were limited to areas of the lesion that are near the lesion surface and deeper lesion areas
have little influence on the dehydration dynamics. In addition, water loss for deeper lesions may
require a longer duration for dehydration than was performed here. Alternatively, high subsur-
face reflectivity due to variable demineralization throughout the whole lesion might have
obscured the true LD, contributing to greater variation in the dehydration values for similar LDs.
Based on previous in vitro OCT studies using simulated lesions on flat surfaces, we expected
ΔR to decrease with increasing TSL thickness due to increasing remineralization.6,28,33 Here, the
relationship was weakly negative but not statistically significant (r ¼ −0.02, p > 0.05). It is
likely that variation in the topography of the tooth influences remineralization. There is also
larger variation of the lesion structure and orientation. Lesions with larger surface area with
less demineralization may have similar ΔRs compared with lesions with smaller surface area
but greater demineralization. Another reason might be that SWIR light behaves differently with
varying composition of the composite restorative materials. Certain composites with opaque
shades have titanium dioxide added as an optical opacifier, which blocks the penetration of
SWIR light and can interfere with imaging through the composite. Therefore, the composition
and surface roughness of some composites might have interfered with accurate measurement of
lesions located underneath the composite material. Even so, previous work has demonstrated the
ability of different OCT systems to adequately image simulated secondary lesions beneath differ-
ent composite types in vitro.30,34 Therefore, even though surface textures, composite material
types, and OCT system types may affect OCT imaging of lesions, there are methods to circum-
vent such limitations and allow OCT to capture the status of secondary lesions nondestructively
for clinical assessment of severity and activity. SWIR and thermal imaging dehydration rates also
seemed to correlate more closely with TSL thickness for smooth surface lesions than those resto-
rations located on occlusal and incisal surfaces.
There was significant correlation of the SWIR and thermal imaging rates and the TSL thick-
ness measured using OCT. A previous study using simulated lesions indicated that a TSL thick-
ness of <20 μm led to large permeability changes and that thicknesses of >50 μm might
completely arrest in vitro lesions.9 Another ex vivo study also showed that coronal lesions with
TSLs thicker than 75 μm led to significantly lower permeability, indicative of lesion arrest.10 In
this study, we found similar comparisons, in which lesions with TSLs >70 μm were significantly
less permeable than lesions with thinner TSLs. Based on these results, we hypothesize that fur-
ther increases in TSL will have limited influence on the lesion permeability. This provides further
confirmation of the utility of SWIR and thermal imaging for monitoring lesion activity.
Although the correlation between permeability measurements and TSL thickness measured
using OCT was strong, the correlation between permeability and the SL thickness measured
using MicroCT was not significant, even though the correlation between the TSL and SL thick-
ness was significant. It is important to emphasize that, although almost all caries lesions possess

some surface zone of increased mineral content, not all surface zones are of sufficiently high
mineral density to qualify as “transparent” surface zones that have reduced reflectivity in OCT
images compared with the reflectivity of the underlying body of the lesion. Previous measure-
ments of light scattering in demineralized enamel at 1300 nm have shown that light scattering
increases markedly with up to 15% mineral loss but increases no further with additional mineral
loss.35 This is consistent with a network of scattering pores in which further mineral loss only
serves to connect the pores without creating more scattering centers to increase reflectivity. In
MicroCT, almost all of the lesions had an SL of higher mineral content that was higher than the
lesion body. OCT is highly sensitive to slight degrees of mineral loss, and we have previously
confirmed that TSLs must contain mineral content near equivalent to sound enamel, making TSL
thickness a better indicator of lesion activity compared with SL thickness.4,11,22,36,37 A future
study to correlate OCT TSL thickness and surface zone of similar mineral content in
MicroCT SL may help further delineate the relationship between OCTand MicroCT for imaging
carious lesions.
5 Conclusion
In this study, we employed SWIR and thermal imaging methods during dehydration to assess the
rate of fluid loss (permeability) that can be used as an indirect measure of the activity of sec-
ondary caries lesions. Increasing TSL thickness measured with OCT correlated with decreased
permeability of lesions, potentially indicating an arrest in activity at thicknesses exceeding
70 μm. SWIR imaging performed better than thermal imaging for the assessment of secondary
caries lesions on tooth coronal surfaces. Thermal imaging performed well in identifying crevices
between composite material and tooth structure, but at times can be masked by the complex
topography of the occlusal anatomy. SWIR imaging did not appear as susceptible to such inter-
ference, owing to the ability to differentiate composite materials, tooth structures, and lesions
with high contrast. These results further demonstrate the potential of SWIR reflectivity and OCT
imaging methods for the clinical monitoring of the activity of secondary caries lesions.
