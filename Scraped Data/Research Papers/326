Abstract
13
Cancers are shaped by somatic mutations, microenvironment, and patient background, each altering gene ex-
14
pression and regulation in complex ways, resulting in heterogeneous cellular states and dynamics. Inferring gene
15
regulatory network (GRN) models from expression data can help characterize this regulation-driven heterogeneity,
16
but network inference requires many statistical samples, traditionally limiting GRNs to cluster-level analyses that
17
ignore intra-cluster heterogeneity. We propose to move beyond cluster-based analyses by using contextualized learn-
18
ing, a multi-task learning paradigm which allows us to infer sample-specific models using phenotypic, molecular,
19
and environmental information pertinent to the model, encoded as the model’s "context" to be conditioned on. We
20
unify three network model classes (Correlation, Markov, Neighborhood) and estimate context-specific GRNs for
21
7997 tumors across 25 tumor types, with each network contextualized by copy number and driver mutation profiles,
22
tumor microenvironment, and patient demographics. Contextualized GRNs provide a structured view of expression
23
dynamics at sample-specific resolution, which reveal co-expression modules in correlation networks (CNs), as well
24
as cliques and independent regulatory elements in Markov Networks (MNs) and Neighborhood Regression Networks
25
(NNs). Our generative modeling approach allows us to predict GRNs for unseen tumor types based on a pan-cancer
26
model of how somatic mutations affect gene regulation. Finally, contextualized networks enable GRN-based preci-
27
sion oncology, explaining known biomarkers in terms of network-mediated effects, and leading to novel subtypings
28
for thyroid, brain, and gastrointestinal tumors that improve survival prognosis.

Introduction
30
Tumors are heterogeneous, developing through clonal evolution that accumulates mutations, including cancer-driving
31
single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). In addition to tumor cell intrinsic
32
changes, tumors develop in and are shaped by a microenvironment that includes immune cells, the extracellular ma-
33
trix, blood vessels and surrounding cells. This extensive heterogeneity necessitates hetereogeneous treatments targeted

samples are identically distributed. Cohorts must be large enough to allow robust inference, presenting a tradeoff be-

powerful context-specific inference without a priori clustering of subpopulations or assuming homogeneity. Contexts

prognosis and biomarker identification. (d) Graphical depiction of the deep learning framework. Sample context is

sought to identify prognostic biomarkers that stratify patients into tumor subtype cohorts, and predictive biomarkers

and/or immunological data, and further identifies prognostic biomarkers as features that differentiate these clusters

tumor pathology. Consequently, the identification of biomarkers using somatic DNA alterations or gene expression
45
patterns has proved challenging [24], but biological dogma and notable exceptions (e.g. HER2 amplification in breast
46
cancer) motivate us to find a systematic way to search for differentiating regulatory factors that reflect cellular states
47
and foreshadow cellular responses to treatments. In our view, biomarker discovery should directly inform the devel-
48
opment of novel treatments, revealing molecular features that relate to the robustness or fragility of molecular systems
49
in individual tumors. Addressing the shortcomings of cluster analysis, we focus on three questions: (1) how do we
50
model the mechanisms of molecular interactions as it relates to tumorigenesis and treatment efficacy, (2) how do we
51
identify prognostic biomarkers for rare diseases and outlier patients that are too sparsely sampled to cluster, and (3)
52
how can we quantify the heterogeneity of tumor pathology, which is widely acknowledged but poorly understood, and
53
encode or represent the myriad of phenotypic, molecular, and environmental factors driving this heterogeneity from
54
observational data alone?
55
Toward representing interactions, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) represent the functional circuitry within cells
56
that simultaneously respond to biomolecular stimulus and drive tumorigenesis. We intuit that many interactions be-
57
tween disparate biomolecular features can be identified at the cellular level through transcriptomic regulation, both
58
directly and indirectly. Further, tumor-specific GRNs capture regulatory redundancy and fragility in individual can-
59
cers, whereby multi-omic features relate to GRN structure and organization, and GRN organization reveals the func-
60
tional mechanisms of tumor pathology and the robustness of therapeutic targets. Single-cell and multi-omic profiling
61
have advanced the potential for studying highly context-specific regulatory relationships in GRNs, but computational
62
methods of inferring GRNs continue to rely on partitioning samples into homogeneous sets of samples [25–28]. As
63
such, existing methods for high-resolution network inference either impose strong biological priors based on known
64
transcription factor-gene regulation [29], or apply a sample-left-out approach that lacks statistical power [30, 31].
65
Partition-based modeling is insufficient to capture high-resolution or continuously rewiring GRNs, a problem for pre-
66
cision oncology because some types of cancer neither form discrete clusters [32] nor cluster by tissue of origin [33].
67
More generally, the exponential increase of data set complexity, heterogeneity, and size, has motivated the need for
68
sample-specific inference in many application areas [34–38]. Contextualized modeling [39] addresses this by repre-
69
senting the heterogeneity in data as driven by sample-specific models, and explaining variation among sample-specific
70
models in terms of sample context encodings. These contexts can be any information that may explain heterogeneity
71
in the data (e.g. age, genotype, medical images, environmental factors). More traditionally, context-driven hetero-
72
geneity might be controlled by performing probabilistic inference on context-specific data sets, but this fails to scale
73
to high-dimensional and continuously-varying contexts, common in biomedical data, where context data splits have
74
as few as one sample and most context conditions are missing entirely. The simplest and most classic version of
75
the contextualization paradigm are varying-coefficient models [40], which account for the effects of a univariate and
76
continuously-varying context on a linear model’s parameters.
77
Modern contextualized models, proposed in [41] and generalized in [39], are a combination of statistical modeling
78
and deep learning, where context encoders are typically neural networks that can utilize any multi-modal contextual
79
information. This framework also introduces the concept of model archetypes (Figure 1d), whereby all sample-specific
80
models are spanned by the set of model archetypes, constraining and explaining their variation through the context
81
encoding which parameterizes this space (See Methods). Thus, these archetypes, also learned from data, link the
82
heterogeneity of sample-specific models to variation in the context encoding and enable sharing information between
83
sample-specific model inference tasks. Many notable works on heterogeneous linear effects use this framework [41–
84
46], but contextualized models have yet to be extended to the more general graphical modeling regime.
85
To infer tumor-specific GRNs that account for patient-to-patient heterogeneity, we propose to reframe GRN in-
86
ference within the contextualized modeling paradigm, thereby sharing information among tumor-specific inference
87
tasks by relating these tasks through their clinical and molecular contexts. By recasting networks as the output of a
88
learnable function, our approach shares statistical power between samples while also permitting fine-grained varia-
89
tion to capture the complexity of sample-specific contexts such as tissue-of-origin, somatic mutation landscape, tumor
90
microenvironment and clinical measurements. We formulate three types of GRNs (Markov, Neighborhood, and Cor-
91
relation networks) under this paradigm, and estimate sample-specific GRNs which enable sample-specific analyses of
92
latent regulatory processes. By applying this computational framework to over 7000 samples, we find that contextu-
93
alized networks improve prediction of held-out expression data and reveal latent heterogeneity which has previously
94
been obscured by partition-based methods of network inference.

Results
96
Graphical model inference is a canonical task in the life sciences, whereby unstructured observational data is trans-
97
formed into graph revealing the latent structure, strength, and direction of interactions between biological entities.
98
However, for heterogeneous populations where latent models change from individual to individual, such as how tu-
99
morigenesis is driven by patient-specific environmental and molecular factors, traditional modeling approaches are
100
ill-defined. We introduce contextualized GRNs, which learn to model the effect of individual clinical and molecular
101
contexts on GRN parameters, revealing latent model-based drivers of GRN dysregulation and tumor heterogeneiety.
102
While GRNs are commonly interpreted as adjacency graphs [25, 27, 29], existing methods for GRN inference can
103
be categorized as variants of four probabilistic models: Markov networks, which represent pairwise dependencies,
104
Pearson’s correlation networks, which represent pairwise correlations, neighborhood regression networks, which rep-
105
resent each node as a linear combination of its neighbors, and Bayesian networks, and which represent directed and
106
acyclic interactions. We focus on Markov, correlation, and neighborhood networks, unifying these models through a
107
reparameterization trick, and thus enable them to be contextualized uniformly within our framework.
108
The power gained from contextualization allows us to estimate highly accurate sample-specific network models
109
without incorporating any prior knowledge of network structure. We apply contextualized graph estimation to infer
110
context-specific networks for 7997 patients in TCGA, utilizing molecular contexts including cancer-driving single nu-
111
cleotide variations (SNVs), somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), biopsy composition metrics, and patient demo-
112
graphics. Across all network classes, contextualized networks confer significant improvements for network accuracy
113
and likelihood, generalizing to held-out populations and held-out disease types. We evaluate our 7997 patient-specific
114
GRNs for new clinical and biological insights, discovering robust state-of-the-art prognostic subtypes for thyroid carci-
115
noma (THCA) and brain lower grade glioma (LGG), as well as cross-tissue disease groups like the gastointestinal tract
116
that includes four distinct tumor types. Finally, patient-specific networks relate prognostic biomarkers to changes in
117
specific regulatory modules and gross GRN organization, and identify candidate biomarkers for further investigation.
118
Contextualization Recovers Latent Variation from Heterogeneous Observational Data
119
Observational data is cheap and abundant in comparison to experimental data, but suffers from complex environmen-
120
tal confounders, contexts, and conditions. To recover latent processes of data generation through model estimation
121
with observational data, the user must artificially control for on sample contexts and conditions to emulate a con-
122
trolled experimental environment. However, controlling for all conditions and contexts simultaneously, especially on
123
biomedical data with high-dimensional contexts, leads to conditions with as few as just one sample – too small to
124
infer accurate context-specific models. Ignoring contextual effects (i.e. population modeling) is similarly ill-advised
125
for heterogeneous data, leading to spurious results from models that are misspecified and inaccurate (e.g. Simpson’s
126
paradox).
127
Contextualization [39] addresses this by applying deep learning to the meta-relationship between contextual in-
128
formation and context-specific model parameters. Contextualization unifies previous approaches such as varying-
129
coefficient modeling [40], cluster analysis, and cohort analysis by introducing two simple concepts: a context en-
130
coder which translates sample context into model parameters, and a sample-specific model which represents the latent
131
context-specific mechanisms of data generation. By learning how models change in response to context, contextual-
132
ization enables powerful control over high-dimensional and continuously varying contexts, discovering dynamic latent
133
structure underlying data generation in heterogeneous populations.
134
Contextualization Enables Estimation of Sample-Specific Correlation, Markov, and Neigh-
135
borhood Networks
136
To contextualize Markov, correlation, and neighborhood networks, we first unify them with linear parameterizations
137
equivalent to each models’ unique constraints (See Methods). Linear parameterization provides a differentiable ob-
138
jective for optimizing each model and the linear residual errors are proportional to the negative log likelihood of
139
each network model under the data. Our unifying linearization of these models allows us to apply contextualization
140
uniformly to each network class, and further enables us to benchmark and test the effects of common model personal-
141
ization paradigms against contextualization in terms of model likelihood and modeling errors.

Error reduction is reported relative to the best baseline, which in all cases is disease-specific modeling.
Contextualized Networks Improve Likelihood of Held-Out Expression Profiles
143
Contextualization improves the fit of networks models to gene expression data (Table 1). We benchmark the contextu-
144
alized networks by comparing against several granularities of partition-based models: (1) a population network model
145
which estimates the same network for all samples, (2) cluster-specific networks that are estimated independently for
146
each cluster of contextual information, and (3) disease-specific networks that are estimated independently for each
147
cancer type (Fig. 7). For all three network models, we evaluate the fit of the network model to actual expression
148
data by measuring the predictive performance of the network graphical model. These predictive performances are
149
measured as mean-squared errors between predicted and observed expression data which are inversely proportional to
150
the model likelihood under the probabilistic interpretation of the network graphical model. Relative to disease-specific
151
model inference (the best baseline method), contextualized networks reduce modeling error on average by 14.6% for
152
Markov networks, 18.1% for neighborhood selection, and 20.2% for correlation networks. Contextualized graphical
153
models achieve this improved predictive performance by accounting for contextual dependencies in model parameters
154
without imposing prior assumptions on the form of these dependencies. As a result, contextualized graphical mod-
155
els capture context-specific effects that can be overlooked by group-level modeling approaches (e.g. cluster-specific,
156
disease-specific models).
157
Contextualized Networks Share Power Between All Cancer Types and Infer Models for Un-
158
seen Diseases
159
Contextualization relates transcriptional regulation to genomic variation through a context encoder (Fig. 1). During
160
training, the encoder learns to modify the parameters of a downstream network model in response to contextual signals.
161
At test time, the encoder uses learned context signals to generalize between sparsely sampled contexts. Rare or
162
undersampled diseases like Kidney Chromophobe (KICH) and Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) can benefit from
163
contextual signals learned from well-sampled diseases in similar tissues (Figure 2b). In disease-specific modeling,
164
these smaller subpopulations must either be lumped within a larger tissue group, ignoring subpopulation heterogeneity,
165
or modeled individually, sacrificing statistical power in a "large p small n" regime. For example, there are n = 75
166
training samples from KICH patients, while each disease-specific network has 50 × 50 edges, or p = 2500 parameters;
167
estimating a disease-specific network from such limited data would be prohibitively high-variance.
168
Furthermore, contextualization adapts models to unseen contexts at test time, responding to even extreme dis-
169
tribution shift (Fig. 2a). For completely unseen contexts, the context encoder can still leverage learned relationships
170
between contexts and models to infer zero-shot network models on-demand. We evaluate model performance through a
171
disease-fold cross vaidation, where we hold out each of the 25 disease types in turn and learn to contextualize networks
172
on the remaining 24. Notably, disease-specific modeling cannot be applied in this regime. In contrast, contextualized
173
networks improve model performance and reduce error on 22 or 25 hold-out diseases, even when generalizing to an
174
entirely new disease type.

Contextualized Networks Reveal Tissue-Specific Regulatory Modules
176
Contextualization produces context-specific network models, resulting in patient-specific networks for all 7997 pa-
177
tients in our TCGA dataset. Organizing patients according to their network models reveals that tissue type is a primary
178
driver, but not the sole factor in determining gene-gene interactions (Fig. 3). In particular, diseased networks dif-
179
fer drastically from healthy networks, while gene and PCA-derived metagene expression profiles are still largely
180
tissue-derived. Additionally, intra-disease (Fig. 5a) and inter-disease (Fig. 6a) subtypes are visible even at pan-cancer
181
resolution (Fig. 3), making obvious common tumorigenesis mechanisms that underly noisy gene expression dynamics.
182
Contextualized Networks Reveal Regulatory Modules Conserved Across Tissues in Cancer
183
Contextualized networks reveal that tumors of the GI tract display a continuum of GRN dysregulation (Figure 6).
184
While this continuum cannot be captured by existing TCGA subtypes [47], contextualized networks form clusters that
185
relate existing subtypes to inter-disease and intra-disease heterogeneity via conserved regulatory motifs and shared
186
dysregulation motifs. Contextualized networks reveal that tumors of the GI tract display a continuum of GRN dys-
187
regulation (Figure 6). While this continuum cannot be captured by existing TCGA subtypes, contextualized networks
188
form clusters that relate existing subtypes to inter-disease and intra-disease heterogeneity via conserved regulatory
189
motifs and shared dysregulation motifs. Finally, contextualized networks discover disparate types of GRN dysregula-
190
tion within patients assigned to the SCNA-derived GI.CIN subtype, comprising the majority of GI tract tumors (Fig.
191

subtypes by flattening the network parameters and applying hierarchical ward clustering. To compare the prognostic
197
utility of network-based subtypes against the prognostic utility of state-of-the-art TCGA subtypes and expression
198
subtypes, we use the same number of clusters for each disease as subtypes annotated in TCGA. We find that network-
199
based subtypes are more prognostic on average than both expression-derived subtypes and TCGA subtypes (Table 2).
200
In general, we find that network-based subtypes either recapitulate or refine prognostic subtypes produced by TCGA,
201
which often utilize additional data types including DNA methylation, miRNA, and histopathological imaging. All
202
subtype comparisons by disease are available in Appendix S4. For 10 of 25 tumor types, contextualized networks
203
reduce one of the survival function p-values by at least an order of magnitude, and in some cases, as much as 9
204
orders of magnitude on KIRC, 4 orders of magnitude on LGG, 2.4 orders of magnitude on THCA, and 2.3 orders
205
of magnitude on HNSC. On KICH, both network subtypes and TCGA subtyapes are outperformed by expression
206
subtypes by 13.5 orders of magnitude. In the second and third worst cases for contextualized networks, network
207
subtypes are outperformed by TCGA subtypes on GBM and UVM in terms of survival prognosis by about 1.5 and 1.3
208
orders of magnitude, respectively.

Discussion
210
In this study, we propose contextualized GRNs as cohesive sample-specific representations of latent tumor states
211
underlying disease progression and survival. Our models reveal new insights about cancer heterogeneity by relating
212
transcriptomic, genetic, immune, and clinical factors to through tumor regulatory network topology.
213
The importance of context in cancer development and treatment is well recognised with treatment decisions fre-
214
quently determined by a tumor’s tissue of origin. The frequency of mutations in specific driver mutations varies
215
substantially between tumors of different tissues and likely reflects the importance of distinct signaling pathways
216
within distinct cellular contexts [48]. For example, BRAF(V600E) driver mutations vary substantially in frequency
217
across cancer types and drugs that target the BRAF(V600E) mutant product are less effective in colorectal cancers
218
than in skin cutaneous melanoma and non-small cell lung cancers with this mutation [49]. Further emphasizing the
219
importance of context beyond the tissue-level, considerable variation in terms of aggressiveness, drug sensitivity, and
220
genomic mutations, is also observed between tumors arising from the same cell type and tissue [50]. These hetero-
221
geneous genetic contexts likely hinder efforts to define tumor subgroups based on specific mutations with epistasis,
222
which involves the action of one gene on another, having been shown to affect treatment efficacy in acute myeloid
223
leukemia where NPM1 mutations confer a favorable prognosis only in the presence of a co-occurring IDH1 or IDH2
224
mutation [51].
225
Although genetic heterogeneity between tumors from the same tumor type is known to be widespread, it has long
226
been thought that heterogeneity at the phenotype level may not be so marked, with the same cellular pathways often
227
affected [52]. For example, dysregulation of the G1–S transition is observed in almost all cancers, and may occur
228
through multiple routes, both promoting proliferation and overriding cellular senescence [53]. However, in spite of
229
the evidence for functional convergence, it is challenging with current statistical methods to identify biomarkers that
230
define similar phenotypes on genetically diverse contexts in order to guide treatment.
231
Many promising expression-based biomarkers use the level of expression across gene pathways or multiple genes
232
rather than identifying specific somatic mutations [24]. Contextualized GRNs provide an intuitive way of identifying
233
both subpopulations with differential transcriptomic regulation and the pathway-level cohorts of genes that should
234
be studied as potential biomarkers, as well as the likely effect size of pathway dysregulation. Contextualized GRNs
235
further identify associated contextual signals with these subpopulations, providing new leads for traditional classes of
236
genomic biomarkers.
237
More broadly, contextualized modeling seeks to estimate context-specific models beyond context-specific sam-
238
pling constraints. By sharing information among samples while also allowing sample-specific variation, our frame-
239
work models complex and dynamic distributions despite physical and technical barriers that would typically prohibit
240
sample-specific inference. Context-dependent models models naturally account for non-identically distributed data
241
and provide a principled method for performing statistical inference on data that would traditionally be too small or
242
too heterogeneous. While it is generally believed that biological observations are a product of latent cellular states and
243
tumors exhibit extreme patient-to-patient heterogeneity, these ideas are orthogonal in traditional modeling regimes.
244
Contextualized GRNs are the first to effectively unite the two: networks are a useful latent representation, relating
245
biomarkers to pathology through systems of molecular interactions, and accounting for network heterogeneity allows
246
us to explore both population-level and per-patient tumor pathology in terms of latent representations of molecular
247
systems.

Contextualized Networks
250
We seek a context-specific density of network parameters P(θ ∣ C) such that
251
P(X ∣ C) = ∫θ dθPM(X ∣ θ)P(θ ∣ C)
is maximized, where PN(X ∣ θ) is the probability of gene expression X ∈ Rp under network model class M with
252
parameters θ ∈ Rp×p and context C, which can contain both multivariate and real features. To overcome θ being a

high-dimensional, structured latent variable, we assume that all contextualized networks lie on a subspace spanned by
254
a set of K network archetypes A ∶= span({Ak ∈ Rp×p ∶ A1,...,AK}), i.e. θ ∈ A. Further, the space spanned by A is
255
parameterized by a latent variable (“subtype”) Z ∈ RK such that Z is a deterministic function of context Z = f(C)
256
and the context-specific network model θ (and subsequently the gene expression observations X) are independent of
257
context given Z, i.e. C ⊥ (X,θ) ∣ Z. In this way, we constrain θ as a convex combination of network archetypes via
258
latent mixing.
259
P(X ∣ C) = ∫θ,Z dθdZPM(X ∣ θ)P(θ∣Z)P(Z ∣ C)

Where the context encoder ϕ(C;f,A) is parameterized by a learnable context-to-subtype mapping f and the set of

archetypes A. This architecture is shown in Figure 1d, and is learned end-to-end with backpropagation. While the
261
archetypal networks Ak could use prior knowledge for initialization or regularization, no prior knowledge is required.
262
In all experiments reported here, we do not use any prior knowledge of network structure or parameters.
263
This framework unites three different perspectives of GRNs: (1) Correlation networks, in which network edges
264
are the pairwise Pearson’s correlation between nodes, (2) Markov networks, in which edges are the pairwise precision
265
values representing conditional dependencies between nodes, and (3) Neighborhood regression networks, in which
266
edges represent directed linear relationships between nodes. The key challenge for each network class is to define a
267
differentiable loss function ℓM that is proportional to the negative log probability of our contextualized network model.

The loss objective can be used in the end-to-end optimization, solving for the context encoder and the network
269
archetypes simultaneously, and subsequently inferring the context-specific parameters θ. Below, we outline a uni-
270
fying linear parameterization of each network loss. Implementation details are discussed in Appendix S1.
271
Contextualized Neighborhood Regression
272
We first apply contextualization to the graph variable selection algorithm proposed by Meinhausen and Buhlmann
273
[54]. The direct relationship of this model to lasso regression links contextualized neighborhood regression to original
274
works on contextualized linear models [41], making it a convenient stepping stone toward the graphical models in the
275
sequel. The model is a Gaussian graphical model where X ∼ N(0,Σ) and Σ has sparse off-diagonal entries. The
276
algorithm, neighborhood regression, recovers edges between nodes with non-zero partial correlations by solving the
277
lasso regression for every feature Xi, given every other feature X−i, where regression maximizes P(Xi∣X−i) via the
278
loss

̂θi = argmin
θ
∥Xi − X−iθ∥2

resulting in edges with source Xj for every j ≠ i and sink Xi and strength θij, or no edge if θij = 0. Equivalently, we
280
parameterize the neighborhood selection objective using the square matrix of network edge parameters θ ∈ Rp×p.

where ⊗ is the hadamard product.
285
Contextualized Markov Networks
286
Linear regression and Gaussian graphical models are intrinsically related, allowing us to extend work on contextualized
287
linear models to various graphical representations of the Gaussian graphical model. To estimate sample-specific
288
precision matrices representing the conditional dependency structure of an undirected graphical model or Markov
289
network, we assume the data is drawn from X ∼ N(0,Ω−1) where Ω = Σ−1 and estimate pairwise partial correlation
290
coefficients. Using an equivalence defined by Peng et al. [55], the partial correlation coefficient is defined by regression
291
as
292
ρij = sign(βij)
√
βijβji = − ωij
ωiiωjj
Where the precision matrix Ω has elements ωij and β is the ordinary least squares solution to multivariate linear
293
regression βi = argminβ ∥Xi − X−iβ∥2
2. Critically, the precision matrix directly encodes conditional independence
294
between features in X, and thus precision encodes the Markov network.
295
ωij = 0 ⇐⇒ Xi ⊥ Xj ∣ X−{i,j}
Following [56], we assume constant diagonal precision wii = wjj∀i,j and therefore achieve proportionality between
296
the regression and the precision matrix.
297
ωij ∝ −sign(̂βij)
√
̂βij ̂βji
Assuming unit diagonal precisions ωii = 1, the proportionality becomes exact equivalence. Further, proportionality
298
induces symmetry in the regression, i.e. βij = βji. We encode this in the objective by requiring our estimate for θ to
299
be a symmetrically augmented matrix based on γ, i.e. β = γ + γT
300
̂γ = argmin
γ
∥X − X(γ + γT )∥2
F s.t. diag(γ) = [0]
If Ω is sparse, we can apply lasso regularization to the multivariate regression objective [54]. Given the similarity
301
between this differential Markov network objective and the neighborhood regression objective, we follow the exact
302
contextualization procedure from above to contextualize γ and arrive at a loss function ℓMN
303
ℓMN(ϕ(C;f,A),X) = ∥X − X(ϕ′(C;f,A) + ϕ′(C;f,A)T )∥2
2 + λ∑
i
∥ϕ′(C;f,A)i∥1
where ϕ′ is defined identically for masking the diagonal. The resulting precision matrix estimate is ̂Ω = −(ϕ′(C; ̂f, ̂
A)+
304
ϕ′(C; ̂f, ̂
A)T ). In practice we do not threshold the estimated precision to non-zero values, instead using the exact pre-
305
cision matrix to represent the Markov network, retaining information about dependency strength as well as dependency
306
structure in the network.

Contextualized Correlation Networks
308
Correlation networks are simple to estimate and often state-of-the-art for gene regulatory network inference [27];
309
contextualized correlation expand this utility to the granularity of sample-specific network inferences. To estimate
310
sample-specific correlation networks, we assume the data was drawn from X ∼ N(0,Σ) and use the well known
311
univariable regression view of Pearson’s marginal correlation coefficient:
312
ρ2
ij =
σij
σiiσjj
= βijβji
where the covariance matrix Σ has elements σij, and βij = argminβ(Xj − Xiβ)2. This form converts correlation into
313
two separable univariate least-squares regressions that maximize the marginal conditional probabilities P(Xi∣Xj) and
314
P(Xj∣Xi). Contextualizing this differentiable objective, we get the contextualized correlation network loss
315
ℓCN(ϕ(C;f,A),X) = ∥X − X ⊗ ϕ(C;f,A)∥2
F
where the context-specific correlation matrix is reconstructed as ̂ρ2 = ϕ(C; ̂f, ̂
A) ⊗ ϕ(C; ̂f, ̂
A)T .
316
Baselines
317
We compare contextualized modeling with several traditional approaches for context-controlled and context-agnostic
318
inference, including population modeling, cluster modeling, and cohort modeling (Fig. 7). A population model as-
319
sumes that the entire sample population is identically distributed. As a result, population modeling infers a single
320
model representing all observations. In reality, sample populations often contains two or more uniquely distributed
321
subpopulations. If we expect that there are several subpopulations with many observations each, and that these subpop-
322
ulations can be stratified by context, it may be appropriate to cluster the data by context to identify these subpopulations
323
and then infer a model for each context-clustered subpopulation. This assumes that all context features are equally
324
important and therefore does not tolerate noise features well. Alternatively, when subpopulation groupings are known
325
to be determined by a few important features, cohort modeling is more appropriate. Sample cohorts can be identified
326
based on prior knowledge about important context features (e.g. disease type).

The baseline modeling regimes enjoy the benefits of traditional inference methods (i.e. identifiability, conver-
328
gence) by relying on the assumption there are a discrete number of subpopulations underlying the observed data that
329
are each defined by a latent model, and each of these subpopulations is well-sampled. This assumption is rarely, if
330
ever, satisfied in a real-world setting. We develop contextualized modeling as a synthesis between traditional statis-
331
tical inference and modern deep learning to enable model-based analysis of heterogeneous real data. Contextualized
332
modeling assumes a functional dependency between models, but unlike prior methods makes no assumption about the
333
form or complexity of this dependency. As such, contextualized models permit context-informed inference even when
334
contexts are sparsely sampled and high dimensional.

338
information, biopsy composition, SCNAs and cancer-driving SNVs (Appendix S2). Gene expression data was log-

Supplemental Information for:
518
Contextualized Networks Reveal Heterogeneous Transcriptomic Regulation in Tumors at Sample-Specific Resolution
519
S1
Implementation
520
Our entire framework (Fig. 1) is implemented in PyTorch using the PyTorch Lightning framework within our open-
521
source software ContextualizedML. The context encoder, network archetypes, and contextualized network models are
522
learned simultaneously using end-to-end backpropagation of the network loss (defined in Methods).
523
Context Encoder & Training
The context encoder is implemented as a multi-layer perceptron with 3 hidden layers,
524
each 100 neurons wide with ReLU activations. The context data views (S2.2) are concatenated sample-wise to create
525
a single context feature vector encompassing all views for each patient. We use a batch-size of 10 and our learning rate
526
is chosen automatically using PyTorch Lightning’s auto-lr-find with an initial state of 1e-3. Model weights are
527
initialized as Uniform[-0.01, 0.01]. We split our dataset into 80% training-validation and 20% testing. We
528
create 30 bootstraps of the training-validation set and finally split into 80% training and 20% validation, resulting in a
529
64-16-20 split for train-validation-test where the train and validation sets are bootstrapped to evaluate model variance.
530
We use early-stopping with a patience of 5 to end training when the minimum validation loss has not been improved
531
for 5 epochs. We retain only the model with the minimum validation loss for each bootstrap. In Table 1, we evaluate
532
these bootstraps individually to get error means and variances. Following this, we apply each of our bootstrapped
533
models to the non-bootstrapped training-validation set and average the outputs of each model to obtain a single graph
534
for each patient in this set, which we evaluate in-depth in Figures 4, 5, and 6, and for all disease types in Appendix S4.
535
The context encoder is a highly flexible component of our framework and a driving force for future work. This
536
attribute can be used to enforce assumptions about the relationships between contexts and models, between context
537
features, and about the archetype space. For instance, by using a neural additive model instead of a multi-layer
538
perceptron, we provide context-feature-specific archetype weights for interpretability. Similarly, we can augment
539
our context encoder with a convolutional base and include imaging modalities in our context views. At the context
540
encoder head, we currently use an unconstrained output, but applying a softmax activation would require all of the
541
sample-specific models to lie within a polytope defined by the archetypal networks.
542
S2
Data
543
S2.1
Data sources
544
The Cancer Genome Atlas3 (TCGA) is a publicly-available pan-cancer datasource containing genomic, transcriptomic,
545
and clinical profiling of tumors from dozens of landmark studies. We queried TCGA for samples with bulk RNA-
546
sequencing and merged this dataset with two follow-up studies on an overlapping set of patients.
547
Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs)
SCNAs affect a larger fraction of the genome than do any other type
548
of somatic genetic alteration [57] and are a major driver of expression variation in cancer [58]. We used copy number
549
profiles derived from TCGA samples using ASCAT [59] from a pan-cancer study of the role of allele-specific SCNAs
550
in cancer [60].
551
Driver single-nucleotide mutations (SNVs)
SNVs can be classified into "driver" mutations thought to provide
552
selective growth advantage and "passenger" mutations thought to have little role in promoting cancer development.
553
We incorporated driver SNVs from the TCGA-derived CHASMplus dataset [61]

S2.2
Context data views
555
Clinical information
This data view incorporates sample tissue-of-origin, race, age at diagnosis, gender, year of
556
birth, and days to collection provided by TCGA.
557
Biopsy Composition
This data view contains the sample’s percent tumor cells, percent normal cells, percent tumor
558
nuclei, percent monocyte infiltration, percent lymphocyte infiltration, and percent neutrophil infiltration provided by
559
TCGA. We also incorporate expression-derived estimates of the fraction of a sample consisting of tumor cells from
560
[60].
561
Copy Number Alterations
From ASCAT [59], we gather whole genome doubling events as well as gain and loss
562
events for bp-specific regions of hg19 based on data from [62]. We transform these gain and loss events into both arm-
563
level and gene-level events, where arm-level events affect 85% of an entire arm in the same event, while genes-level
564
events affect a single gene. We transform these into number of major and number of minor chromosome arms, and
565
the number of major and minor alleles for the set of 295 genes that overlap between COSMIC [63] and MSigDB [64].
566
For both gene and arm-level events, we create a separate indicator for loss of heterozygosity on each gene.
567
Driver Mutations
From CHASMplus [61] we gather the mutations on all COSMIC [63] oncogenes/tumor suppresor
568
genes and binarize the presence or absence of a mutation in each gene.
569
S2.3
Transcriptomic data views
570
Transcriptomics
We take the set of known oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes annotated in COSMIC [63] and
571
included in TCGA gene expression panels. We then calculate the variance of each gene in each tumor type and take a
572
weighted sum of these variances according to the total number of samples in each tumor type. We select the top 100
573
genes by this metric of “intra-disease variance”.
574
Baselines
We are not aware of any other scalable meta-learning, deep learning, or varying-coefficient methods to
575
produce context-informed correlation, Markov, and Bayesian networks under a universal framework. As such, our
576
baselines apply the network estimators in S1 under several well-known and general paradigms for improving model
577
personalization, broadly relating to cluster analysis. Our population baseline provides no personalization, learning a
578
single model for the entire population of training samples. Our context-clustered baseline takes an unsupervised ap-
579
proach to personalization by first doing a k-means clustering with k=25 on the aggregated context views (S2) and then
580
inferring cluster-specific networks. Our disease-clustered baseline uses a personalization oracle, grouping samples by
581
tumor type and then inferring disease-specific networks.
582
S3
Related work
583
State-of-the-art gene regulatory network estimators are limited to population, cohort, and cluster-based approaches
584
[26, 65, 66]. Other proposals to estimate networks as the difference between a population model and a sample-left-
585
out model lack statistical power [30]. Kolar et. al achieve sample-specific network estimation without sacrificing
586
statistical power by using an approach similar to classic varying-coefficient models that weighs samples by their
587
distance over context [67]. However, this approach inherently assumes smoothness of the parameters over a context,
588
which does not align with our understanding of the non-linear, switch-like changes in biological systems that lead
589
to disease. Contextual estimation networks (CENs) remove this smoothness assumption by inferring the relationship
590
between context and model parameters with a neural network, but the CEN framework is only proposed as an adaptive
591
learning approach for linear models [41]. Context-varying linear models have previously been applied to multi-omic
592
cancer data, where context-varying coefficients inform how epigenetic markers have patient-specific effects on clinical
593
outcomes [42]. Linear models do not inform us of the differential gene-gene interactions that explain changes in
594
cellular behavior. To understand regulatory and metabolic variation at per-sample resolution, we require network
595
models with context-varying structures and parameters.
