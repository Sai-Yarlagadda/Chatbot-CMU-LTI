Abstract
Federated learning is a promising paradigm that allows multi-
ple clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing the
local data. However, the presence of heterogeneous devices
in federated learning, such as mobile phones and IoT devices
with varying memory capabilities, would limit the scale and
hence the performance of the model could be trained. The
mainstream approaches to address memory limitations focus
on width-slimming techniques, where different clients train
subnetworks with reduced widths locally and then the server
aggregates the subnetworks. The global model produced from
these methods suffers from performance degradation due to
the negative impact of the actions taken to handle the varying
subnetwork widths in the aggregation phase. In this paper, we
introduce a memory-adaptive depth-wise learning solution in
FL called FEDEPTH, which adaptively decomposes the full
model into blocks according to the memory budgets of each
client and trains blocks sequentially to obtain a full inference
model. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
achieving 5% and more than 10% improvements in top-1 ac-
curacy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. We also
demonstrate the effectiveness of depth-wise fine-tuning on
ViT. Our findings highlight the importance of memory-aware
techniques for federated learning with heterogeneous devices
and the success of depth-wise training strategy in improving
the global model’s performance.
Introduction
Federated Learning (FL) is a popular distributed learning
paradigm that can address decentralized data and privacy-
preserving challenges by collaboratively training a model
among multiple local clients without centralizing their pri-
vate data (McMahan et al. 2017; Kairouz et al. 2021). FL
has gained widespread interest and has been applied in nu-
merous applications, such as healthcare (Du Terrail et al.
2022), anomaly detection (Zhang et al. 2021), recommenda-
tion system (Lin et al. 2020b), and knowledge graph com-
pletion (Zhang et al. 2022). However, a defining trait of
FL is the presence of heterogeneity — 1) data heterogene-
ity, where each client may hold data according to a dis-
tinct distribution, leading to a sharp drop in accuracy of FL
(Zhao et al. 2018), and 2) heterogeneous clients, which are

equipped with a wide range of computation and communi-
cation capabilities — challenges the underlying assumption
of conventional FL setting that local models have to share
the same architecture as the global model (Diao, Ding, and
Tarokh 2021). In the last five years, data heterogeneity has
been largely explored in many studies (Karimireddy et al.
2019; Lin et al. 2020a; Li et al. 2020a; Seo et al. 2020; Acar
et al. 2021; Zhu, Hong, and Zhou 2021; Li, He, and Song
2021; Tan et al. 2022). However, only a few works aim to
address the problem of heterogeneous clients, particularly
memory heterogeneity in FL (Diao, Ding, and Tarokh 2021;
Hong et al. 2022).
One solution to heterogeneous clients is to use the small-
est model that all clients can train, but this can severely im-
pact FL performance as larger models tend to perform better
(Frankle and Carbin 2019; Neyshabur et al. 2019; Bubeck
and Sellke 2021). Another approach is to prune channels of
the global model for each client based on their memory bud-
gets and average the resulting local models to produce a full-
size global model (Diao, Ding, and Tarokh 2021; Hong et al.
2022; Horvath et al. 2021). However, such approaches suf-
fer from the issue of under-expression of small-size models,
since the reduction in the width of local models can signif-
icantly degrade their performance due to fewer parameters
(Frankle and Carbin 2019). The negative impact of aggre-
gating small-size models in FL is also verified by our case
studies in Section .
Considering the exceptional performance of the full-size
model, we aim to provide an algorithmic solution to enable
each client to train the same full-size model and acquire ad-
equate global information in FL. Specifically, we propose
memory-adaptive depth-wise learning, where each client se-
quentially trains blocks of a neural network based on the
local memory budget until the full-size model is updated. To
ensure the classifier layer’s supervised signal can be utilized
for training each block, we propose two learning strategies:
1) incorporating a skip connection between training blocks
and the classifier, and 2) introducing auxiliary classifiers.
Our method is suitable for memory-constrained settings as it
does not require storing the full intermediate activation and
computing full intermediate gradients. Additionally, it can
be seamlessly integrated with most FL algorithms, e.g., Fe-
dAvg (McMahan et al. 2017) and FedProx (Li et al. 2020a).
Apart from providing adaptive strategies for low-memory
arXiv:2303.04887v2  [cs.LG]  10 Jan 2024
local training, we investigate the potential of mutual knowl-
edge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2018) to
address on-the-fly device upgrades or participation of new
devices with increased memory capacity. Lastly, we con-
sider devices with extremely limited memory budgets such
that some blocks resulting from the finest network decom-
position cannot be trained. We propose a partial training
strategy, where some blocks that are close to the input sides
are never trained throughout. The main contributions of our
work are summarized as follows.
1. Through
comprehensive
analysis
of
memory
con-
sumption, we develop two memory-efficient training
paradigms that empower each client to train a full-size
model for improving the global model’s performance.
2. Our framework is model- and optimizer-agnostic. The
flexibility allows for deployment in real-world cross-
device applications, accommodating clients with varying
memory budgets on the fly.
3. Our proposed approach is not sensitive to client partic-
ipation resulting from unstable communication because
we learn a unified model instead of different local mod-
els as in prior works.
4. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance
of the proposed methods is better than other FL base-
lines regarding top-1 accuracy in scenarios with hetero-
geneous memory constraints and diverse non-IID data
distributions. We also show the negative impact of sub-
networks using width-slimming techniques.
Related Work
Federated Learning
FL emerges as an important paradigm for learning jointly
among clients’ decentralized data (Koneˇcn`y et al. 2016;
McMahan et al. 2017; Li et al. 2020a; Kairouz et al. 2021;
Wang et al. 2021a). One major motivation for FL is to pro-
tect users’ data privacy, where users’ raw data are never dis-
closed to the server and any other participating users (Abadi
et al. 2016; Bonawitz et al. 2017; Sun et al. 2019). Partly
opened by the federated averaging (FedAvg) (McMahan
et al. 2017), a line of work tackles FL as a distributed op-
timization problem where the global objective is defined by
a weighted combination of clients’ local objectives (Mohri,
Sivek, and Suresh 2019; Li et al. 2020a; Reddi et al. 2020;
Wang et al. 2020b). The federated learning paradigm of Fe-
dAvg has been extended and modified to support different
global model aggregation methods and different local opti-
mization objectives and optimizers (Yurochkin et al. 2019;
Reddi et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021a,b, 2020a). Theoretical
analysis has been conducted, which demonstrated that feder-
ated optimization enjoys convergence guarantees under cer-
tain assumptions (Li et al. 2020b; Wang et al. 2021a).
Device Heterogeneity in Federated Learning.
Especially for cross-device FL, it is a natural setting that
client devices are with heterogeneous computation power,
communication bandwidth, and/or memory capacity. A
few research efforts have been paid to designing memory
heterogeneity-aware FL algorithms. HeteroFL (Diao, Ding,
and Tarokh 2021) and FjORD (Horvath et al. 2021) al-
lows model architecture heterogeneity among participating
clients via varying model widths. The method bears similar-
ity to previously proposed slimmable neural network (Yu
et al. 2018; Yu and Huang 2019) where sub-networks with
various widths and shared weights are jointly trained with
self-distillation (Zhang, Bao, and Ma 2021). SplitMix (Hong
et al. 2022) tackles the same device heterogeneity problem
via learning a set of base sub-networks of different sizes
among clients based on their hardware capacities, which
are later aggregated on-demand according to inference re-
quirements. While recent studies like InclusiveFL (Liu et al.
2022) and DepthFL (Kim et al. 2023) have also embraced
a layer-wise training approach, they allocate model sizes to
clients primarily based on a fixed network depth, e.g., tak-
ing 2 layers as a computation block. This method does not
accurately represent on-device capabilities during network
splitting, as layers at varying depths have distinct computa-
tion and memory costs.
In summary, prior research efforts mainly focus on parti-
tioning the global model weights among participating users
given their hardware resource constraints, which may be im-
precisely evaluated. Consequently, each local user only ac-
cesses a portion of the global model. In this work, however,
we seek a holistic approach to handling device heterogene-
ity in FL without the need for partitioning model weights.
Instead, our approach allows each device to train a full-size
model in a sequential manner.
Empirical Study
Preliminaries
This section briefly reviews prior significant and open-
sourced works that aim to address heterogeneous clients in
FL, including HeteroFL (Diao, Ding, and Tarokh 2021) and
SplitMix (Hong et al. 2022). We then conduct an extensive
analysis of memory consumption of training a neural net-
work, which has not been explored thoroughly in the FL
community.
Width-scaling FL for heterogeneous clients.
Existing
works such as HeteroFL (Diao, Ding, and Tarokh 2021)
and SplitMix (Hong et al. 2022) address memory hetero-
geneity by pruning a single global model in terms of chan-
nels, creating heterogeneous local models. HeteroFL is the
first work in FL that tackles memory heterogeneity via the
width-scaling approach but still produces a full-size global
model. However, HeteroFL suffers from two major limita-
tions: 1) partial model parameters are under-trained because
only partial clients and data are accessible for training the
full-size model; 2) small models’ information tends to be ig-
nored because of their small-scale parameters. SplitMix was
then proposed to address these two issues, which first splits
a wide neural network into several base sub-networks for
increasing accessible training data, then boosts accuracy by
mixing base sub-networks.
Memory consumption analysis.
Training a neural net-
work with backpropagation consists of feedforward and
backward passes (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams 1986).
A feed-forward pass over each block of a neural network
generates an activation or output. These intermediate acti-
vations are stored in the memory for the backward pass to
update the neural network. Although several works of lit-
erature (Sohoni et al. 2019; Gomez et al. 2017; Raihan and
Aamodt 2020; Chen et al. 2021) demonstrate that activations
usually consume most of the memory in standard training of
a neural network as shown in Figure 1, HeteroFL and Split-
Mix merely consider the number of model parameters as the
memory budget in their experiments. Specifically, they di-
vide clients into groups that are capable of different widths,
e.g., a 1
8-width neural network, which costs approximately 1
8
activations but only around
1
82 model parameters compared
to the full-size neural network.

Behaviors of Sub-networks in Prior Works
In this section, we analyze the behaviors and influences of
sub-networks in HeteroFL and SplitMix with respect to the
performance of the global model.
Experimental setting.
We follow the configuration on the
CIFAR-10 dataset in SplitMix (Hong et al. 2022), where
10 out of 100 clients participate in training in any given
communication round, and each client has three classes of
the data. In our case studies, we divide clients into four
groups with { 1
8, 1
4, 1
2, 1}-width sub-networks in HeteroFL,
and into two groups with {r, 1} in SplitMix, where r =
{ 1
16, 1
8, 1
4, 1
2}. Our observations are summarized below.
1. Small sub-networks make negative contributions in
HeteroFL. Figure 2 (left) presents typical examples of
HeteroFL (Diao, Ding, and Tarokh 2021) under non-IID
settings. The orange line represents the default setting
of HeteroFL, where all sub-networks of different widths
are aggregated. The other lines indicate specific size
of sub-networks that are not aggregated. For example,
the green line indicates that the smallest ( 1
8-width) sub-
networks do not participate in aggregation. We observe
that the global model obtained via aggregating small sub-
networks consistently has worse performance than the
global model obtained via only aggregating the full-size
neural networks, indicating that small size sub-networks
make negative contributions.
2. Small sub-networks limit global performance in Split-
Mix. Figure 2 (right) depicts the prediction performance
of the global model in SplitMix (Hong et al. 2022)
by mixing base neural networks with different-width. It
clearly illustrated that slimmer base neural networks pro-
duce a less powerful global model. Intuitive reasoning is
that combining very weak learners leads to an ensemble
model with worse generalization.
3. The full-size net makes a difference. Inadequate pres-
ence of the full-size models incurs degradation of vali-
dation accuracy as shown in Figure 2. Besides, in real-
world FL systems, communication can be unstable, and
clients with the largest memory budgets may not be avail-
able in each round of communication (Bonawitz et al.
2017). This constraint limits the practicality of both Het-
eroFL and SplitMix.

SplitMix (right) with the varying-width base model, respectively.
Methodology
Inspired by the observation in the previous section, we in-
troduce a memory-efficient framework FEDEPTH to train
full-size neural networks with memory budget constraints in
the FL setting. FEDEPTH aims to empirically solve the opti-
mization problem minW F(W) := PK
k=1 pkFk(W). Here,
Fk represents the loss function on the kth clients. pk > 0
for all k and PK
k=1 pk = 1. FEDEPTH features memory-
adaptive decomposition, where a neural network is decom-
posed into blocks based on the memory consumption and
local clients’ memory budgets. An implict assumption made
is that all blocks can be trained locally after the decomposi-
tion. To further address extreme case that some blocks still
cannot fit into the memeory even after the finnest decom-
position, FEDEPTH integrates the partial training strategy
into the local training stage. We also consider the possibilty
that some clients with rich memory budgets may suffer from
memory underutilization, hence a variant of FEDEPTH is
propsed to use mutual knowledge distillation (Zhang et al.
2018) to boost the performance and fully exploit the local
memory of clients.
FEDEPTH and Its Variants
Memory-adaptive network decomposition.
Since vari-
ous clients could have drastically different memory budgets,
FEDEPTH conducts local training in a memory-adaptive
manner. Specifically, for the k-th client the full model
W is decomposed to into Jk + 1 blocks, i.e., W
=

15: end procedure
{θk,1, · · · , θk,Jk, ϕ}, where {θk,j}Jk
j=1 and ϕ denote body
and head of the neural network, respectively. Note that θk,j
can be different from θk′,j for any (k, k′, j) triple, and
the number of parameters contained in θk,j is solely deter-
mined by the kth client’s memory budget, hence FEDEPTH
is memory-adaptive. In practice, the model decomposition
can be determined for each client before training via the es-
timating memory consumption (Gao et al. 2020). See Figure
3 for an illustration. Suppose the full-size model is com-
posed of 6 layers, where each of layer costs memory of
{3, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5} GB, respectively. Assume the kth and
k′th client has 3 GB and 5 GB memory budget, respectively.
Then, client k has Jk = 3 and client k′ has Jk′ = 2 trainable
blocks, respectively. That is, client k′ will start with training
the first two blocks, then the remaining four blocks.
Depth-wise sequential learning.
Once the decomposition
is determined, the k-th client at the t-th round, locally solves
Jk subproblems in a block-wise fashion, i.e., for all j ∈
{1, . . . , Jk},
(θt+1
k,j , ϕt+1
j
) ∈ arg min
θk,j,ϕ L(θk,j, ϕ; {zt+1
j−1,i, yi}nk
i=1),
(1)
where L is a loss function, e.g, cross-entropy; {zt+1
j−1,i}nk
i=1
are activations obtained after the local training samples
forward-passed through the first j blocks, i.e., zt+1
j−1,i =
f(xi; {θt+1
k,ℓ }j−1
ℓ=1) for i ∈ [nk] and f(·; {θt+1
k,ℓ }j−1
ℓ=1) is the
neural network up to the first j − 1 blocks; nk is the to-
tal number of training samples. Specifically, zt+1
0,i
= xi for
all i ∈ [nk]. Problem (1) can be solved by any stochas-
tic gradient-based method. When solving for the j-th sub-
problem at the tth round, to fully leverage the global model
Wt’s body and the locally newly updated head, we use
(θt
j, ϕt+1
j−1) as the initial point. See the data flow in Figure
4 when performing the training for the jth block. We re-
mark that when the memory budget permits, the activation
{zt+1
j−1,i}nk
i=1, which no longer requires the gradient, could
be buffered to compute {zt+1
j,i }nk
i=1 once the θt+1
k,j
is ob-
tained, hence saving the redundant forward-pass from the
first block to the jth block. Also, the number computation
required for approximately solving Jk subproblems in the
form of (1) should be similar to approximately solving the
problem minW Fk(W) if we perform the same number of
local updates, and ignore the negligible computation over-
head in updating in the head ϕ. This is because the amount
of computation required by one gradient evaluation ∇WFk
is equivalent to that of the summation of gradient evaluation
of {∇θjL}Jk
j=1.

There are three training steps: 1) training the first block and
the classifier with the skip connection (He et al. 2016a); 2)
freezing the updated first block and using its activation to
train the second block and the classifier with the skip con-
nection; 3) freezing the updated first two blocks and using
the activation of the second block to train the third block
and the classifier.
Memory-efficient Inference.
Depth-wise inference fol-
lows the similar logic of the frozen-then-pass forward in
depth-wise training. Specifically, for each input x, we store
the activation zj in the hard drive and discard the predeces-
sor activation zj−1. Then we can reload zj into memory as
the input and get the activation zj+1. The procedure is re-
peated until the prediction ˆy is obtained.
We end this section by giving the detailed algorithmic de-
scription in Algorihtm 1.
Handle Extrem Memory Constraints with Partial
Tranining
According to the memory consumption analysis in the Em-
pirical Study, the memory bottleneck of training a neural
network is related to the block with the largest activations,
which some devices may still not afford. These “large”
blocks are usually the layers close to the input side. To
tackle this issue, we borrow the idea of partial training in
FEDEPTH, where we skip the first few blocks that are too
large to fit even after the finnest blocks decomposition. This
mechanism would not incur significant performance degra-
dation because the input-side layers learn similar represen-
tations on different datasets (Kornblith et al. 2019), and
clients with sufficient memory will provide model param-
eters of these input-side layers in the FL aggregation phase.
Figure 5 emeprically validates such a strategy. We train a
customized 14-layer ResNet (13 convolution layers and one
classifier) on MNIST with 20 clients under non-IID distribu-
tion, respectively and measure the similarity of neural net-
work representations, using both canonical correlation anal-
ysis (CCA) and centered kernel alignment (CKA) (Kornblith
et al. 2019).
Figure 5: Correspondences between layers of different local
neural networks trained from private datasets in FL under
non-IID distribution. We observe that early layers, but not
later layers, learn similar representations.
Exploit Sufficient Memory with Mutual Knowledge
Distillation
Previous works on heterogeneous FL ignore the situation
where some clients with rich computing resources may par-
ticipate in the federated training on the fly. Their sufficient
memory budget could be potentially utilized to improve the
performance of FL via regularizing local model training
(Mendieta et al. 2022; Li et al. 2020a). Ensembling multiple
models is an effective way to improve generalization and
reduce variance (Shi et al. 2021; Nam et al. 2021). How-
ever, considering each model is independently trained in en-
semble learning methods, we have to upload/download all
of these models in FL settings leading to a significant com-
munication burden. Therefore, we design a new training and
aggregation method based on mutual knowledge distillation
(MKD) (Hinton et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2018), where all
student neural networks learn collaboratively and teach each
other. Therefore, clients with sufficient memory only need to
upload one of the local models to the server for aggregation
because the knowledge consensus achieved among all mod-
els through distillation. Formally, assume the kth client has

Experiments
Experimental Setups
Datasets and data partition.
Our experiments are mainly
conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR100 (LeCun et al. 1998;
Krizhevsky and Hinton 2009). Extensive results are attached in the
appendix. To simulate the non-IID setting with class imbalance, we
follow (Yurochkin et al. 2019; Acar et al. 2021; Gao et al. 2022)
to distribute each class to clients using the Dirichlet distribution
with α(λ), where λ = {0.3, 1.0}. Besides, we adopt pathological
non-IID data partition β(Λ) that is used by the selected baselines –
HeteroFL and SplitMix (Diao, Ding, and Tarokh 2021; Hong et al.
2022), where each device has unique Λ labels with Λ = {2, 5}
for CIFAR-10 while Λ = {10, 30} for CIFAR-100. We note that
the balanced data partition is applied by default, which makes each
client holds the same number of examples. The unbalanced αu(λ)
non-IID, where clients may have a different amount of samples
with different feature distribution skew, is also used to evaluate the
stability of FEDEPTH.
Memory budgets. Using Pre-Activation ResNet-20 (PreResNet-
20) (He et al. 2016b) as an example, we show the relation of the
memory cost of each block between width-wise and depth-wise
training in Table 1. We can see that if clients afford to train 1

width PreResNet-20, they can train the full-size neural network via
depth-wise training. The training order is { B1 → B2 → B3 →
B4 → B5,6 → B7,8,9 }. Inspired by this example, we simulate
three memory budget scenarios.
• (Fair). The memory budgets depend on the hidden channel
shrinkage ratio, r = { 1
6, 1
3, 1
2, 1}, and are uniformly distributed
into clients. It means 1/4 of clients can train a PreResNet-20
model within a maximal width of 1
6-, 1
3-, 1
2- and full width,
respectively.
• (Lack). r = { 1
8, 1
6, 1
2, 1}. 1/4 of clients with limited memory
adopt a partial training strategy.
• (Surplus). r = { 1
6, 1
3, 1
2, 2}. 1/4 of clients with sufficient mem-
ory can apply MKD.

Table 2: Test results (top-1 accuracy) under balanced non-IID data partitions using PreResNet-20. Grey texts indicate that the
training cannot conform to the pre-defined budget constraint. If not specified, FedAvg denotes the results with × min(r) -width
network. We highlight the best results with Blue Shadow , Red Shadow , and Bold in the scenarios including clients equipped
with fairly sufficient, insufficient and abundant memory, respectively.
Implementation and evaluation. We compare FEDEPTH and its
variants with several methods, including FedAvg (McMahan et al.
2017), HeteroFL (Diao, Ding, and Tarokh 2021), SplitMix (Hong
et al. 2022) and DepthFL 2 (Kim et al. 2023) in terms of the average
Top-1 Accuracy over 5 different runs. The memory budgets are
uniformly distributed to 100 clients. All experiments perform 500
communication rounds with a learning rate of 0.1, local epochs of
10, batch size of 128, SGD optimizer, and a cosine scheduler.
Global Model Evaluation
Results in the Fair Budget scenario. In Table 2, we compare test
results on a global test dataset (10,000 samples) considering a vari-
ety of balanced non-IID data partition and memory constraints. We
highlight the best results under different scenarios. In all cases, Het-
eroFL, SplitMix, and FEDEPTH family outperform vanilla FedAvg,
showing their system designs’ effectiveness under balanced data
distribution. Among all methods, our proposed FEDEPTH and m-
FEDEPTH achieve the best performance with significant improve-
ments. For example, on CIFAR10, under Fair Budget, FEDEPTH
gains 4.09 ± 0.30% average improvement compared to HeteroFL
while gains 3.99±1.77% average improvement compared to Split-
Mix. m-FEDEPTH gains 5.35±1.13% average improvement com-
pared to HeteroFL while gains 5.25 ± 1.20% average improve-
ment compared to SplitMix. Figure 6 shows convergence curves of
FEDEPTH on non-IID CIFAR-10 dataset.
Results in the Lack Budget scenario. We observe that HeteroFL
has relatively slight accuracy drops or increases compared to the
fair budget scenario. The explanation could be deducted from the
behaviors of sub-networks discussed in the previous section and
Figure 2 that small sub-networks slightly influence the global per-
formance because the small number of model parameters provides
limited knowledge of the global model in the aggregation phase
of FL. In contrast, SplitMix has an apparent performance degrada-
tion of an average of 5.55 ± 0.81% due to the weaker base learner.
The FEDEPTH and m-FEDEPTH are relatively stable algorithms
against insufficient memory budget, showing 1.73 ± 0.34% and
2.74 ± 0.97% degradation, respectively.

Results in the Surplus Budget scenario. We let the new clients
with rich resources r = 2 join in FL and replace the clients with
r = 1. Prior works, like HeteroFL and SplitMix, did not con-
sider such dynamics, and the clients with more memory budgets
still train ×1 neural networks. An alternative way is to train a new
large base model from scratch and discard previously trained ×1
neural networks, hence wasting computing resources.
From Table 2, we can observe that MKD indeed makes sense
for improving the performance of the global model (still ×1-
width). Furthermore, we note that combining depth-wise training
and MKD is a flexible solution to simultaneously solve dynamic
partition, device upgrade, and memory constraints. For example,
when a new client with r = 7
6 enters into the federated learning, the
client can locally learn two models via regular and depth-wise se-
quential training, respectively, and then perform MKD while main-
taining an original-size model for aggregation.
Comparison between FEDEPTH and its variant. As shown
in Table 2, for CIFAR-10, FEDEPTH and m-FEDEPTH can
achieve similar prediction accuracy. However, for CIFAR-100, m-
FEDEPTH always outperforms FEDEPTH. It is worth recalling the
design of FEDEPTH, which introduces zero paddings to match the
dimension between two skip-connected blocks. This may inject
negligible noise for the training on more complex data. Replacing
the zero paddings with other modules, such as convolutions, may
result in a better model. However, this usually comes at the cost
of extra memory because of the new activations and parameters,
which is usually intolerable to resource-constrained devices.

blocks, while FedAvg (× 1

encoder blocks.
Influence of Unbalanced Non-IID Distribution
Table 3 shows the prediction results on distributed datasets in FL
from the unbalanced Dirichlet partition (Fair Budget). We note that
HeteroFL and SplitMix were not evaluated on such an unbalanced
distribution. Overall, the higher skewed distribution leads to worse
performance for FL, which can be observed by comparing results
on Table 2 and Table 3.
Since the number of samples per class in CIFAR-100 is lim-
ited (there are 500 samples for each class), αu(λ) and α(λ) will
output similar statistical distribution according to the number of
samples on each client in FL. Therefore, we obtain similar CIFAR-
100 results on both balanced and unbalanced non-IID data parti-
tions. Specifically, α(λ) always outputs 400 training samples per
client on average. For CIFAR-100, αu(0.3) outputs 399.40±34.53
training samples per client, αu(1.0) outputs 399.34 ± 17.74. For
CIFAR-10, αu(0.3) outputs 399.44 ± 150.60 training samples per
client, αu(1.0) outputs 399.39 ± 77.37.
Regarding CIFAR-10 results, we observe that HeteroFL and
SplitMix cannot achieve comparable predictions or generalization
ability compared to FedAvg. SplitMix even performs worse than
training with the smallest models in FL. This result indicates that
SplitMix is not robust to unbalanced distribution. One reason for
this phenomenon is that small base models cannot capture repre-
sentative features due to the significant weight divergence between
local clients stemming from a highly skewed distribution (Frankle
and Carbin 2019; Li et al. 2022). For HeteroFL, as mentioned in the
case study in Section , the full-size neural networks on resource-
sufficient devices provide the fundamental ability but small sub-
networks trained with unbalanced distribution indeed affect the
global performance. In contrast to HeteroFL and SplitMix, our pro-
posed FEDEPTH and m-FEDEPTH gain substantial improvements
of 6.15% and 6.53% on CIFAR-10, and of 12.24% and 11.57% on
CIFAR-100 compared to FedAvg.
Depth-wise Fine-tuning on ViT
Foundation models or Transformer architectures (Vaswani et al.
2017; Zhou et al. 2023), such as Vision Transformer (ViT) (Doso-
vitskiy et al. 2020), has shown robustness to distribution shifts
(Bhojanapalli et al. 2021). Recent work has demonstrated that re-
placing a convolutional network with a pre-trained ViT can greatly
accelerate convergence and result in better global models in FL(Qu
et al. 2022). Inspired by this finding, we hypothesize that fine-
tuning ViT with depth-wise learning will still produce a better
global model because 1) decomposing blocks in a depth-wise
manner maintains the knowledge learned from pretraining, and
2) memory consumptions of activations in each ViT’s block are
identical, which indicates that skip connection for handling re-
source constraints does not introduce any noises and extra param-
eters. The memory budgets in terms of the width shrinkage ratio

Table 3: Experimental results on unbalanced Dirichlet par-
titions. Because of the relatively limited number of samples
per class in CIFAR-100, an unbalanced Dirichlet partition
outputs similar statistical distribution according to the num-
ber of local data examples.
r = { 1
6, 1
3, 1
2, 1} are uniformly allocated to 100 clients as the same
setting of PreResNet-20 in the scenario of Fair Budget.
For fine-tuning, we choose a learning rate of 5 × 104 and a
training epoch of 100. Figure 7 shows the test results of ViT-
T/16 (Qu et al. 2022) under balanced Dirichlet data partitions, on
which we observe that exploiting FEDEPTH and m-FEDEPTH can
produce good global models. Specifically, FEDEPTH-ViT signifi-
cantly outperforms FEDEPTH-PreResNet-20 with 36.06±12.79%
and 30.64 ± 4.24% improvements on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-
100 on average, respectively. m-FEDEPTH-ViT significantly out-
performs m-FEDEPTH-PreResNet-20 with 36.66 ± 12.88% and
27.41 ± 3.13% improvements on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 on
average, respectively. We also observe that although local ViTs are
fine-tuned on varying distribution data, we obtain global models
with similar performance. It indicates that ViT is more robust to
distribution shifts and hence improves FL over heterogeneous data.
Conclusions
Despite the recent progress in FL, memory heterogeneity still re-
mains largely underexplored. Unlike previous methods based on
width-scaling strategies or fixed-depth split, we propose adap-
tive depth-wise learning for handling varying memory capabili-
ties. The experimental results demonstrate our proposed FEDEPTH
family outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms including Het-
eroFL, SplitMix and DepthFL and are robust to data heterogeneity
and client participation. Furthermore, using the robustness of ViT
to heterogeneous distribution shifts, we reach an excellent global
model via our depth-wise solutions. FEDEPTH is a flexible and
scalable framework that can be compatible with most FL algo-
rithms and is reliable to be deployed in practical FL systems and
applications.

Visualization of Label Distribution
We consider 100 clients in all experiments, and in Figure 8, we
show label distributions of 5 out of 100 clients under balanced
α(0.3), α(1.0) and unbalanced αu(0.3), αu(1.0) splits of CIFAR-
10.
Extensive Experimental Results
Large-scale FL experiments
We also conducted experiments on EMNIST with 500 and 1000
clients, respectively, with the 0.1 participation rate, and fair budget
with α(1). Additionally, we report the results on FEMNIST (Cal-
das et al. 2018), a natural-split FL dataset derived from partition-
ing 3597 writers from EMNIST. Furthermore, we present results
on TinyImageNet under with 100 clients and 0.1 participation rate.
The results are shown in the following table.

Fairness evaluation
According to the definition of fairness in FL from (Li et al. 2021),
we can take the std of test accuracy as a fairness measure. Here we
use the std of testing accuracy across 100 clients with the Cifar10
dataset as shown in the following table. Besides, we compare the
local training time (in seconds) of each client in one round in the
table below.
