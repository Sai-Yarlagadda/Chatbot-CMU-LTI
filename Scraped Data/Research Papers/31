Abstract: Treatment regimens are regularly evolving, together with novel therapies and drugs. Such 
evolution is necessary to circumvent resistance mechanisms and to give patients the best possible 
health care. When dealing with cancer, most regimens involve multiple treatments (surgery, 
radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc.). The purpose of this study was to associate 
in a single compound metal-based drugs and photosensitizers to combine chemotherapy and 
photodynamic therapy. Two arene-ruthenium tetrapyridylporphyrin compounds (2H-TPyP-arene-
Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru) have been synthesized and evaluated on two colorectal cancer cell lines 
(HCT116 and HT-29). The cytotoxicity and phototoxicity have been evaluated. In addition, the 
anticancer mechanism and the cell death process mediated by the two compounds were studied. 
The results showed that the two arene-ruthenium photosensitizer-containing complexes have a 
strong phototoxic effect after photoactivation. The 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru induced outstanding 
cytotoxicity when compared to the Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru analogue. Moreover, under light, these two 
arene-ruthenium photosensitizers induce an apoptotic process in human colorectal cancer cell lines.

1. Introduction 
Cancer is a group of diseases that refer to abnormal cell division leading to uncontrolled cell 
growth and proliferation, and when occurring in the colon or rectum, the disease is defined as 
colorectal cancer (CRC) [1]. In 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have estimated that CRC was the third most common cancer 
worldwide with approximately 1.9 million cases annually and the second leading cause of death for 
oncological reasons with globally 900 000 deaths [2,3]. CRC mainly originates from a benign tumor 
or adenomatous polyp that evolves into a dangerous malignant tumor [4]. This transformation is 
characterized by the capacity of the cells to infiltrate the different histological layers of the organs [5]. 
The most dangerous stage is the metastatic phase, when the cancer cells have acquired the ability to 
detach from the initial tumor and invade other organs through the blood or lymph, and create 
secondary tumors [6]. Today, CRC treatment is at a crossroad, strategies involve many conventional 
and advanced scientific methods. These therapies incorporate surgery/polypectomy, radiation 
therapy, chemotherapy, combination therapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy [7–9].

Unfortunately, these methods are still insufficient for the complete cure of advanced CRC. 
Researchers have tried to provide modern alternative approaches to fight CRC resistance 
mechanisms [10]. Over the past decade, significant progress in CRC treatments has been achieved 
through the development of novel drugs and elaborate treatment protocols. However, the increasing 
resistance of tumor cells toward these new drugs and persistent side effects due to their toxicity on 
healthy tissues make it imperative to add other options to CRC treatment regimens. 
 
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted widespread attention in recent years as a non-
invasive and highly selective approach for cancer treatment [11,12]. The molecular mechanism of 
PDT involves the photoactivation of a photosensitizer (PS) at an appropriate wavelength in the 
presence of oxygen molecules [13–15]. In effect, PDT exploits the potency of visible light to generate 
cytotoxic agents in a spatially and temporally controlled manner to directly damage the targeted 
tumor cells and tissues [16,17]. PDT is mainly associated to the production of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS), which are involved in cell death [18,19]. To happen, the PS must absorb at least one photon to 
be promoted to a sufficiently long-lived excited state, and then to induce photodynamic reactions in 
an oxygenated environment [20]. Under the effect of light irradiation, the PS is activated and goes 
from a ground to an excited state [21,22]. At this stage, the PS is very unstable and loses its excess 
energy either directly or via an excited triplet state intermediate [23]. The excited triplet state will 
slowly return to the ground state by photochemical reactions of type I or II. Both reactions may take 
place simultaneously, their kinetics being strongly correlated to the presence of oxygen, the substrate 
concentration, and the nature of the PS. In type I reactions, the free radicals may further react with 
oxygen to produce ROS [24,25]. Superoxide anion initially produced via type I pathway by 
monovalent reduction does not cause oxidative damage but reacts with itself to generate oxygen and 
hydrogen peroxide. However, in type II reactions, the excited PS transfers its energy directly to 
molecular oxygen to form singlet oxygen. These highly cytotoxic ROS can oxidize a variety of 
biomolecules, inducing an acute stress response and triggering a series of redox signaling pathways, 
generally leading to cell death [26–28]. Currently, the most widely used PS in PDT are tetrapyrrole 
derivatives such as porphyrins, chlorins, bacteriochlorins, and phthalocyanines. Nevertheless, the 
main inconveniences of these planar aromatic PS are their low water solubility, which limits 
intravenous administration, their poor photophysical properties due to PS aggregation, and their low 
tumor selectivity, thus overall limiting their use in the clinic [29]. 
Chemotherapy is essential to cancer treatments. Indeed, platinum-based drugs like oxaliplatin 
and carboplatin, which remain at the forefront of the CRC regimens, are used on an everyday basis 
[30]. Unfortunately, this type of metal-based drugs has shown significant side effects, which has led 
to the search for new and less toxic anticancer metal-based agents [31]. Among other metal-based 
drugs, ruthenium (Ru) derivatives have received much attention due to their interesting properties 
[32]. And some Ru-based chemotherapeutics have already entered clinical trials [33]. Moreover, 
about 15 years ago, combining PDT and chemotherapy with Ru-based complexes was introduced 
[34,35], and today such a Ru complex, TLD1433, is in clinical trial [36]. TLD1433 is a cationic bis(4,4’-
dimethyl-2,2’-bipyridine) 
(dmbp) 
and 
2-(2,2':5',2''-terthiophene-5-yl)-1,3,7,8-tetraaza-1H-
cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene (ip-3t) Ru(II) complex with the general formula [Ru(dmbp)2(ip-3t)]2+. This 
complex exploits the rich photophysical properties of polypyridyl Ru-based complexes. Upon 
photoactivation of the Ru-center, an intra-ligand charge transfer (ILCT) is taking place, which 
generates 1O2. This ruthenium complex combines efficiently photochemotherapy and PDT in a single 
molecule.  
Recently, we have proposed another strategy to associate PS and Ru-based complexes in a single 
molecule, 
using 
a 
coordination 
self-assembly 
process 
[37]. 
In 
these 
systems, 
two 
tetrapyridylporphyrin units are linked by four arene-Ru clips (Figure 1). Such octanuclear complexes 
allow internalization of the PS to cells, and they show moderate dark cytotoxicity on ovarian cancer 
cell lines (≈ 8 μM) [38]. Herein, we are looking at the possibility of using these metalla-assemblies to 
treat CRC by a combination of PDT and chemotherapy. Therefore, we have verified whether the 
photoactivity of the PS has been modified or not when it is part of a metalla-assembly by investigating

the anticancer effect of the functionalized 2H-TPyP and Zn-TPyP with arene-Ru complexes on human 
HCT116 and HT-29 colorectal cancer cell lines. Then, for better understanding the cell death process 
involved, we examined the cell cycle distribution, phosphatidylserines externalization, as well as 
caspase-3 activation, poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and DNA fragmentation. 
Subsequently, consistent with other PDT studies, our results demonstrated that once photoactivated, 
2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru assemblies generate cellular ROS production and achieve 
their anticancer effects through an apoptotic process.

2. Results 
2.1. Cytotoxicity and phototoxicity 
To investigate the in vitro phototoxicity of 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru, we 
treated or not two human CRC cell lines: HCT116 and HT-29. Then, the cells were exposed or not to 
PDT with red irradiation (630-660 nm) and phototoxic effects were determined 24 and 48h post-
irradiation using the MTT assay. Results showed that TPyP-arene-Ru complexes had no toxic effect 
on HCT116 and HT-29 cell lines in the dark below 1 μM, and that cell growth was unaffected by light 
alone (Fluence 75 J/cm2). However, upon photoactivation, both 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-
arene-Ru complexes lead to a drastic decrease in cell viability in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 
2 and 3). It is worth mentioning that 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru complex was more effective than the Zn-
TPyP-arene-Ru analogue on both cell lines.

CURElight lamp at 75 J/cm2 (PhotoCure ASA, Oslo, Norway). MTT assays were performed at 24 and 
48h after irradiation, and cell cytotoxicity was expressed as a percentage of each treatment condition 
compared with untreated cells. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3). * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01 and 
*** p < 0.001.

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured for 36h before being treated or not with 2H-TPyP-
arene-Ru or Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru. After 24h incubation, the cells were washed and irradiated or not 
with a CURElight lamp from 630-660 nm at 75 J/cm2 (PhotoCure ASA, Oslo, Norway). MTT assays 
were performed at 24 and 48h after irradiation, and cell cytotoxicity was expressed as a percentage of 
each treatment condition compared with untreated cells. Data are presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3). * 
p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001. 
The IC50 values were determined to compare the impact of adding a diamagnetic metal (Zn2+) to 
the center of the tetrapyrrole ring in 2H-TPyP panels after activation with PDT. We observed that 2H-
TPyP-arene-Ru was much more effective than Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru in the HCT116 cell line with 8-fold 
more photo-cytotoxicity 24h post-irradiation (Figure 2). IC50 values were in the range of 41.9 nM for 
2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and 331.2 nM for Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru. Our compounds revealed more cytotoxicity 
at 48h where IC50 values decreased to 35.2 nM for 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and 207.4 nM for Zn-TPyP-
arene-Ru, respectively (Table 1). Similar results were observed for the HT-29 cell line that showed 
more resistant than HCT116, as their respective IC50 values were 67.8 nM for 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and 
393.9 nM for Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru at 24h (Figure 3). These values decreased to be respectively 54.1 nM 
for 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and 379.3 nM for Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru after 48h (Table 1). The concentrations 
used for the following experiments correspond to the IC50 values obtained under light.

2.2. ROS generation 
As PDT-induced cell death by cellular ROS production, quantification of ROS was determined 
in the two cell lines 1h post-irradiation. Cells were labeled with dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate 
(DCFDA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used as positive control. The results showed that when 
HCT116 cells were treated with both compounds and then photoactivated (630-660 nm, 75 J/cm2), the 
ROS production for 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru was 79.4%, while for Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru ROS production was 
75.5%. In the dark, both compounds show limited ROS production, being 15.5% and 14.2%, 
respectively. A similar result was observed in HT-29 cells, where photoactivation of 2H-TPyP-arene-
Ru resulted in 82.8% ROS production vs. 14.9% in the dark, while for Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru the ROS 
production was 79.9% vs. 11.2% in the dark (Figure 4).

treated or not with 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru or Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru at IC50 concentrations. The cells were 
labeled with DCFDA and irradiated or not. ROS production was then quantified by flow cytometry 
and interpreted using the % positive fluorescence values given in the tables. *** p < 0.001. 
2.3. Cellular internalization 
The significant phototoxic effects of the complexes may be due to an enhanced cellular 
internalization of the cationic porphyrin arene-Ru assemblies. In order to confirm the cellular uptake 
of our compounds, a study regarding the internalization of 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-
Ru was performed using flow cytometry coupled with AMNIS® image analysis and further 
confirmed by confocal microscopy.  
Flow cytometry image analyses show high cellular internalization of 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru with 
89% and 81% in HCT116 and HT-29 cells respectively. Similar results were observed for the Zn-TPyP-
arene-Ru analogue, 82% in HCT116 and 85% in HT-29 cells, suggesting that the presence of Zn2+ in 
the porphyrin core does not alter the internalization process. This internalization was reflected by the 
red fluorescence of both compounds in cells (Figure 5). Cellular internalization was also confirmed 
by confocal microscopy as the fluorescence of 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru or Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru (red) was

clearly observed in the cytoplasm of the cells, with however no accumulation in the nucleus (Figure 
6).

the fluorescence of 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru (excitation: 405 nm; emission: 650 nm) and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru 
(excitation: 561 nm; emission: 655 nm) were analyzed by flow cytometry coupled to AMNIS® image 
analysis.

2.4. Cell cycle activity 
PDT can induce irreversible photodamage leading to cell death, and to define the cell death 
process triggered by our compounds, the impact on cell cycle activity was determined. Accordingly, 
HCT116 and HT-29 cells were treated or not at the phototoxic IC50 concentrations and then subjected 
to flow cytometry analysis using PI staining after PDT. Results showed that on HCT116 cells, 2H-
TPyP-arene-Ru induced a strong increase in the number of apoptotic cells represented by the sub-G1 
peak mainly at 48h with 33.83% vs 0.65% for control. In contrast, Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru was shown to 
have less effect on sub-G1 cells with 5.29% vs 0.65% for control at 48h (Figure 7). Similar results were 
observed on HT-29 cells, where 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru produced an increase in the number of apoptotic 
cells as signaled by a sub-G1 peak of 9.04% vs 1.22% for the control at 24h. Likewise, we observed a 
drastic increase at 48h with a 26.98% sub-G1 peak vs 2.19% for the control (Figure 8). On both cell 
lines, the complexes have no influence on the cell cycle without photo-activation, the concentrations 
being far below the IC50 in the dark (Table 1). Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that at 48h 
post-irradiation, 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru-PDT induced an accumulation of S-phase cells with a decrease 
in the number of G1 phase in both cell lines.

to flow cytometry analysis using PI staining after PDT. Images of cell cycle analysis (A) were 
representative of three separate experiments. Results of flow cytometry analysis are represented by 
histograms (B) that display the percentage of cells in each cell cycle phase. Data are shown as mean ±

2.5. Mechanisms of apoptosis 
2.5.1. Annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining  
Cell cycle analysis of HCT116 and HT-29 cells treated with either 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru or Zn-
TPyP-arene-Ru revealed the appearance of a sub-G1 population referring to cells in apoptosis. 
Therefore, we have studied the mechanism of apoptosis induced by both complexes on HCT116 and 
HT-29 cells 24 and 48h post-PDT. The apoptotic process was first investigated using annexin V-
FITC/PI dual staining assay. During the early stages of apoptosis, phosphatidylserines are known for 
their translocation from the inner to the outer plasma membrane of cells, thus, phosphatidylserines 
externalization allows binding to annexin V. Therefore, the percentages of apoptotic cells at early and 
later stages were determined by dual staining with annexin V-FITC and PI by flow cytometry. Results 
showed that in HCT116 cells, control, light control, 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru 
treated cells were mostly viable, whereas the cumulative rate of early and late apoptosis was 11.31%, 
11.29%, 9.79%, and 10.23% respectively at 24h. This rate has increased dramatically with the 
conjugation of irradiation to be 49.25% for 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru-PDT more effective than Zn-TPyP-
arene-Ru-PDT with 21.58% (Figure 9A). Same as for 48h after PDT, 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-

arene-Ru caused 61.46% and 42.41% of apoptosis respectively, compared to 12.96% for control, 
15.24% for light control, 16.22% for 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and 22.14% for Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru complexes 
without photoactivation (Figure 9B). Similar results were obtained on HT-29 cells after 
photoactivation of 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru respectively, with 35.45% and 22.81% 
vs. controls (control: 6.70%, light control: 8.02%, 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru dark: 8.38% and Zn-TPyP-arene-
Ru dark: 7.29%) at 24h (Figure 9C) and with 58.31% and 36.87% vs. controls (control: 13.44%, light 
control: 12.92%, 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru dark: 10.67% and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru dark: 13.07%) at 48h (Figure 
9D).

cell lines. Cells were grown for 36h in an appropriate culture medium before exposure or not to 2H-
TPyP-arene-Ru or Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru complexes at IC50 concentrations. After 24h incubation, cells 
were irradiated or not with a 630-660 nm CURElight lamp at 75 J/cm2 (PhotoCure ASA, Oslo, 
Norway). HCT116 and HT-29 cells were also stained, 24h post-PDT (A-C) and 48h post-PDT (B-D) 
with Annexin V-FITC and PI, and apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The upper right 
quadrant represents the percentage of late apoptosis, and the lower right quadrant represents early 
apoptosis. Images shown were representative of three separate experiments. 
2.5.2. Quantitative analysis of activated caspases-3/-7 
The apoptotic process was further analyzed at a later stage of apoptosis. For this purpose, 
quantitative analysis of activated caspases-3/-7 was carried out using the IncuCyte® S3 live-cell 
analysis system for 48h. For the HCT116 cell line (Figure 10), the results showed that photoactivation 
of TPyP-arene-Ru led to a significant increase in the number of activated caspases-3/-7 as early as 6h 
after treatment. In fact, both compounds generated a significant increase in this activity over time 
when compared to the light-control at 48h post-irradiation (70-95% for 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru light and

(Figure 11).

2.5.3. Protein expression of apoptotic markers 
Activation of effector caspases results in the cleavage of several cellular substrates. One of the 
substrates of caspase-3 is PARP, an enzyme involved in DNA repair. For this reason, protein 
expression of this apoptotic marker was analyzed by Western blotting(WB). In the HCT116 and HT-
29 cell lines, the results showed that in the dark, 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru, Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru and the 
control have no effect on the expression of native caspase-3 after 24 and 48h. In contrast, we mainly 
noticed that photoactivation of 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru resulted in cleavage of 
native caspase-3 (35 kDa), and consequently its activation, which was observed by the appearance of

the cleaved caspase-3 fragment (19 kDa). To confirm the role of 2H-TPyP and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru-
PDT on apoptosis, other investigations on later stages of the process had to be evaluated, such as the 
state of PARP. Cleavage of PARP is considered as a hallmark of cells undergoing apoptosis. We 
compared the expression of native and cleaved PARP forms in treated and untreated cells using WB. 
After PDT, results showed that 2H-TPyP and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru induced PARP cleavage as shown 
by the highly apparent 89 kDa cleavage fragment for HCT116 (Figure 12A) and HT-29 (Figure 12B) 
cell lines, associated with a decreased expression of the native PARP in treated cells compared to 
control at 24 and 48h.

HCT116 (A) and HT-29 (B) cells. Cells were seeded at the determined density and cultured for 36h, 
then treated or not with 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru or Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru at IC50 concentrations. After 24h 
incubation, the culture medium was replaced and cells were irradiated or not. At 24 and 48h post-
irradiation, the cells were then recovered and protein expression determined by WB. β-actin was used 
as the reference protein. 
2.5.4. DNA fragmentation 
In order to study the nuclear changes in apoptosis caused by 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-
arene-Ru, DNA fragmentation was evaluated by ELISA assay in both cell lines after 24 and 48h. The 
outcomes indicate that in HCT116 cells (Figure 13A-B), 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru-PDT leads to a significant 
increase in DNA fragmentation by 3.7-fold at 24h and 5.6-fold at 48h compared to non-irradiated 
conditions 1.3-fold and 0.8-fold respectively compared to control. Similarly, Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru 
coupled with PDT increased DNA fragmentation by 2.4-fold and 1.2-fold at 24 and 48h respectively 
compared to non-irradiated conditions 1.4-fold and 0.7-fold compared to control. 
HT-29 cells showed similar results (Figure 13C-D), 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru coupled with PDT induce 
a significant increase in DNA fragmentation by 3.3-fold at 24h and 5.4-fold at 48h, whereas the non-
irradiated condition showed no significant effect with 0.7-fold and 1.0-fold respectively compared to 
control. Likewise, Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru with PDT increased DNA fragmentation mainly at 48h by 1.9-
fold compared to non-irradiated condition 1.0-fold compared to control.

3. Discussion 
PDT is an innovative cancer therapy that offers advantages over conventional treatments. 
Despite its potential advantages, only a small number of PS have been approved in the clinic, mainly 
porphyrin-type compounds [39]. This type of PS is often limited due to low solubility in biological 
media, but when incorporated into delivery vectors, they can be internalized into cells. Based on this 
assumption, the conjugation of porphyrin with metals has received much attention [40]. Recent 
scientific studies showed that ruthenium complexes are one of the most interesting metal-based 
drugs used in the treatment of several cancers such as colon cancer [32,33]. The interesting properties 
of Ru complexes have led to their potential use in various fields such as PS and photoactive DNA 
cleavage agents for therapeutic purposes [41]. Several studies reported that porphyrin-Ru complexes 
had significant anticancer effects. Bogoeva et al. reported Ru porphyrin-induced photodamage in 
bladder cancer cells [42]. In addition, Schmitt et al. demonstrated that 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-
pyridyl)porphyrin (TPP) arene Ru (II) derivatives exhibited excellent phototoxicities toward 
melanoma cells when exposed to light at 652 nm [34]. Cellular uptake and localization microscopy 
studies of [Ru4(η6-C6H5CH3)4(TPP)Cl8] revealed that they accumulated in the cytoplasm of melanoma 
cells. Another study provided by Rani-Beeram et al. established that fluorinated Ru porphyrin 
presented a strong DNA interaction that leads to its cleavage in melanoma cells [35]. More recently, 
we reported that cubic or prismatic cages can serve as an ideal carrier for PS to treat rheumatoid 
arthritis [37,43]. 
In the current study, we have determined the biological activity of cationic TPyP-arene-Ru 
metalla-assemblies (Figure 1) on CRC cells. We wanted to evaluate the potential of such octanuclear 
Preprints (www.preprints.org)  |  NOT PEER-REVIEWED  |  Posted: 28 September 2023                   doi:10.20944/preprints202309.1909.v1

assemblies as anticancer agents on CRC. For this purpose, we determined the effect of 2H-TPyP-
arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru complexes associated with PDT on two human CRC cell lines 
(HCT116 and HT-29). First of all, we evaluated the cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity of 2H-TPyP-
arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru, and we demonstrated that both structures have a significant photo-
cytotoxic effect on the two CRC cell lines studied, IC50 values being in the nanomolar range. However, 
in the dark, the concentrations required to observe a cytotoxic effect on those cell lines are much 
higher (Table 1), suggesting that PDT is the dominant therapy over chemotherapy. This result was 
not necessarely surprising considering that the structure of the assemblies contains two units of 
tetrapyridylporphin as PS, which has the effect of strengthening the effectiveness of the PDT 
treatment and consequently providing a better therapeutic effect under light. The IC50 values of 2H-
TPyP-arene-Ru coupled with PDT on both cell lines are 5 to 8-times higher when compared to the 
Zn-tetrapyridylporphin analog. This can be linked to the stronger fluorescence of PS with a metallic 
center. Fluorescence is a consequence of the energetic decay from the excited state of the PS to the 
minimum energy state. Therefore, high fluorescence quantum yield (ØF) suggests that most of the 
energy in the singlet excited state of the PS returns to the ground state without passing through the 
triplet excited state. Consequently, generating more fluorescence, but leaving behind less energy in 
the triplet state to interact with O2 and to produce ROS. However, in all cases, we systematically 
obtained under PDT a significant cytotoxic effect for which the IC50 values are in the nanomolar range. 
Inhibition of cancer cell proliferation by cytotoxic drugs could be the result of induction of 
apoptosis or cell cycle arrest or a combination of both processes. Therefore, we investigated the cell 
growth mechanism inhibition by flow cytometry analysis. We demonstrated that 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru 
and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru coupled with PDT led to a significant increase in the proportion of apoptotic 
cells, as reflected by the sub-G1 peaks. Whereas, only 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru at 48h post-irradiation 
showed accumulation of S-phase cells, while Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru-PDT showed no significant effect on 
cell cycle distribution. In order to evaluate the induction of apoptosis mechanism leading to cell 
death, we investigated by flow cytometry the percentage of phosphatidylserines externalization of 
apoptotic cells by annexin-V-FITC/PI dual staining assay. We established that photoactivation of 2H-
TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru increased dramatically the cumulative rate of early and late 
apoptosis, which can confirm cell death via apoptosis. These results are in agreement with a study 
held by Silva et al. reporting the apoptotic cell death in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells treated 
with Ru(II)-thymine complexes [44]. Furthermore, to validate the apoptotic mechanism, we evaluated 
the last stages in the death mechanism up to DNA fragmentation, we demonstrated that 2H-TPyP-
arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru coupled with PDT induced caspase-3 activation, significant PARP 
cleavage and DNA fragmentation. This result can be related to the strong potential of Ru complexes’ 
photophysical and photochemical properties that allow them to bind to DNA and induces its 
cleavage by photoactivation [45]. These results agree with Lu et al. study, which reports the anticancer 
effect of Ru complexes on hepatocellular carcinoma [46].

2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru complexes were prepared as previously described 
[47]. Stock solutions of TPyP-arene-Ru complexes were dissolved at 1 mM concentration in DMSO, 
then were diluted in culture medium to obtain the appropriate final concentrations just before use. 
The concentration of DMSO in culture medium was lower than 0.1% in all cases, which is considered 
to be non-toxic. 
4.2. Cell culture and treatment 
Human CRC cell lines HT-29 and HCT116 were purchased from the American Type Culture 
Collection (ATCC-LGC Standards, Mosheim, France). Cells were grown in DMEM medium for HT-
29 cells and RPMI 1640 medium for HCT116 cells. Culture mediums were supplemented with 10% 
FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Cultures were 
maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. For all experiments, cells were 
seeded at 2.1×104, 1.2×104 cells/cm2 for HT-29 and HCT116 cells respectively. Cells were washed and 
the culture medium was replaced by a red phenol-free appropriate culture medium before PDT.  
4.3. Cytotoxicity and phototoxicity 
Cytotoxicity and phototoxicity was determined using an MTT assay. Briefly, cells were seeded 
in 96-well culture plates and grown for 36h in an appropriate culture medium before exposure or not 
to 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru or Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru complexes. After 24h incubation, cells were washed and 
irradiated or not with a 630-660 nm CURElight lamp at 75 J/cm2 (PhotoCure ASA, Oslo, Norway). 
The emission spectrum of this light source is shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). MTT 
assays were performed 24 and 48h post-irradiation and cell cytotoxicity was expressed as a 
percentage of each treatment condition by normalizing to untreated cells. 
4.4. Intracellular ROS production 
Cellular ROS production was quantified using the 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate cellular 
reactive oxygen species detection assay kit. Cells were seeded in 25 cm2 culture flasks at the 
determined density and cultured for 36h. Cells were then treated or not with 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru or 
Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru at the determined IC50 values. After 24h incubation, cells were labeled with 
DCFDA for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were then washed, the medium replaced by the corresponding 
medium without phenol red, and irradiated or not. Cellular ROS generation was then quantified 1h 
after irradiation by flow cytometry analysis. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used as a positive control 
at 800 μM. 
4.5. Cellular internalization 
4.5.1. Flow cytometry with AMNIS imaging 
Cells were seeded in 25 cm2 culture flasks at the determined density and cultured for 36h. Cells 
were then treated with 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru or Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru at the determined IC50 values. After 
1-4h incubation, the natural fluorescence of 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru (excitation: 405 nm; emission: 650 nm) 
or Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru (excitation: 561 nm; emission: 655 nm) was analyzed by flow cytometry 
coupled with AMNIS® image analysis, and the data were analyzed with IDEAS® software (Merck). 
4.5.2. Confocal microscopy  
Cells were seeded for 36h in an incubation chamber (ibidi) coated with a gel containing acetic 
acid (20 mM) and type I collagen (3 mg/mL). Cells were then treated at the determined IC50 values. 
Photographs were taken using a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser microscope. Meta - x1000 (Marly-
le-Roi, France). Co-localization was analyzed using the ImageJ software.

4.6. Cell cycle analysis 
The cell cycle distributions in colorectal HT-29 and HCT116 cell lines were analyzed by flow 
cytometry using propidium iodide (PI) staining. For each cell line, cells were treated or not with the 
determined IC50 values of 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru for 24 and 48h, then harvested 
with trypsin. For flow cytometry analysis, 1.5×106 cells of each condition were collected, washed with 
PBS, and fixed by adding 1 mL of chilled 70% ethanol in PBS and stored at -20°C. Following fixation, 
cells were pelleted, washed in cold PBS, resuspended in 500 µL of cold PBS containing 30 µL of RNase 
A (10 mg/mL), and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After staining with 25 µL of PI, the 
percentage of cells in each stage of the cell cycle was determined using the FACS system (BD 
Biosciences, San Jose, CA). All the experiments were performed on three samples.  
4.7. Mechanisms of apoptosis 
4.7.1. Annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining assay 
The annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining assay was used to determine the percentage of apoptotic 
cells. For each cell line, cells were treated or not with the determined IC50 values of 2H-TPyP-arene-
Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru for 24 and 48h and then harvested with trypsin. 2.5×105 cells of each 
condition were collected, washed in PBS, centrifuged, and resuspended in 300 µL binding buffer (1X) 
containing 5 µL of annexin V-FITC and 1 µL of PI (0.1 mg/mL) at room temperature in the dark. After 
15 min incubation, cells were analyzed for the percentage undergoing apoptosis using the FACS 
system (BD Biosciences).  
4.7.2. Quantitative analysis of activated caspases-3/-7 
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at the determined density and cultured for 36h. Cells were 
then treated or not with 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru or Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru at the determined IC50 values. After 
24h incubation, the culture medium was replaced by the corresponding phenol red-free medium, and 
the cells were then irradiated or not. Cells were then treated with caspases-3/-7 green reagent (5 μM) 
and placed in the IncuCyte® S3 live cell analysis system (Sartorius). Every 2h, cells were imaged at a 
rate of 4 images per well in phase contrast and green fluorescence using x20 magnification. The 
number of cells in apoptosis was quantified with IncuCyte® software (Sartorius) using the ratio of the 
number of fluorescent cells. 
4.7.3. Protein extraction and western blot analysis 
For each cell line, cells were treated or not with the determined IC50 values of 2H-TPyP-arene-
Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru for 24 and 48h and then harvested with trypsin. For total protein 
extraction, collected samples of each condition were washed in PBS. Then, the total cell pool was 
centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min at 4°C and homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 
150 mM NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 20 mg/mL of aprotinin) containing 
protease inhibitors according to the manufacturer's instructions as previously described [48]. The 
protein level was determined using the Bradford method. Proteins (60 µg) were separated on 12.5% 
SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Saclay, France). 
Membranes were probed with respective human antibodies against caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, 
PARP and β-actin used as a loading control, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 
incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies, blots were developed using the "Immobilon 
Western" substrate following the manufacturer's protocol and G: BOX system (Syngene, Ozyme). 
4.7.4. DNA fragmentation 
For each cell line, cells were treated or not at the determined IC50 concentrations of 2H-TPyP-
arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru for 24 and 48h and then harvested with trypsin. Histone release 
from the nucleus during apoptosis was analyzed using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS as

previously described [49]. 2×105 cells of each condition were obtained and DNA fragmentation was 
measured according to the manufacturer's protocol. 
4.8. Statistical Analysis 
All quantitative results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of separate 
experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated by the two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test and 
expressed as: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001. 
5. Conclusions 
In this study, we have evaluated the anticancer efficacy of 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-
arene-Ru metalla-assemblies on two human CRC cell lines, HCT116 and HT-29. We have 
demonstrated a strong in vitro anticancer efficacy of 2H-TPyP-arene-Ru and Zn-TPyP-arene-Ru 
complexes under a PDT regimen. Moreover, our results showed a stronger phototoxicity effect for 
the metal-free porphyrin derivative, and they confirmed that cell death occurred via an apoptotic 
pathway. On the other hand, the chemotherapeutic window appeared to be at a much higher 
concentration, suggesting that the role of the Ru atoms in the biological activity of the metalla-
assemblies might be superficial. However, without the presence of the arene-Ru units, the 
internalization of the PS into cells would have been negligible, TPyP being insoluble in biological 
media. Therefore, the presence of Ru is essential, and the combination of Ru and PS within metal-
based assemblies remains an attractive strategy to add to the regimen of CRC treatments.
