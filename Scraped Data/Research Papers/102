Abstract 
Background Mounting evidence indicates that the gut microbiome (GMB) plays an essential role in kidney stone 
(KS) formation. In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the composition of 
gut microbiota in kidney stone patients and healthy individuals, and further understand the role of gut microbiota in 
nephrolithiasis.
Results Six databases were searched to find taxonomy-based comparison studies on the GMB until September 2022. 
Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 to estimate the overall relative abundance of gut microbiota in KS 
patients and healthy subjects. Eight studies were included with 356 nephrolithiasis patients and 347 healthy subjects. 
The meta-analysis suggested that KS patients had a higher abundance of Bacteroides (35.11% vs 21.25%, Z = 3.56, 
P = 0.0004) and Escherichia_Shigella (4.39% vs 1.78%, Z = 3.23, P = 0.001), and a lower abundance of Prevotella_9 (8.41% 
vs 10.65%, Z = 4.49, P < 0.00001). Qualitative analysis revealed that beta-diversity was different between the two 
groups (P < 0.05); Ten taxa (Bacteroides, Phascolarctobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Flavobacterium, Akkermansia, Lacto-
bacillus, Escherichia coli, Rhodobacter and Gordonia) helped the detection of kidney stones (P < 0.05); Genes or protein 
families of the GMB involved in oxalate degradation, glycan synthesis, and energy metabolism were altered in patients 
(P < 0.05).
Conclusions There is a characteristic gut microbiota dysbiosis in kidney stone patients. Individualized therapies like 
microbial supplementation, probiotic or synbiotic preparations and adjusted diet patterns based on individual gut 
microbial characteristics of patients may be more effective in preventing stone formation and recurrence.

Background
With an estimated 5-year recurrence rate of up to 50% 
[1], kidney stone (KS) disease is a widespread issue that 
affects roughly 10–15% of the global population; its 
prevalence is the highest among urological diseases [2]. 
The most common kidney stone type is calcium oxalate 
(76%), followed by hydroxyapatite (18%), uric acid (4.8%), 
struvite (0.9%), and brushite (0.9%) [3]. Long-term renal 
stones can cause urinary tract obstruction, infection and 
irreversible renal function damage, seriously affecting 
the quality of life and health of patients. Moreover, kid-
ney stone disease increases the risk of chronic kidney

disease, end-stage kidney disease, and dialysis therapy [4, 
5]. It is believed that environmental, dietary, hormonal, 
and genetic factors all play a role in the underlying etiol-
ogy in the majority of patients [6–8]. Symptomatic kid-
ney stone management has evolved from open surgical 
lithotripsy to minimally invasive endoscopic treatment, 
which has become the mainstream treatment. However, 
the demand for more effective therapies to prevent the 
occurrence and recurrence of stones persists and necessi-
tates a deeper comprehension of the mechanisms under-
lying stone formation [9].
Recent research has shown a growing connection 
between human diseases and the microbiota, and this 
connection is especially strong for the gut microbiome 
(GMB). GMB is formed by the trillions of commensal 
bacteria, fungi, archaea and viruses that are densely dis-
tributed in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals [10]. 
Dysbiosis of the GMB can cause metabolic, immune 
and mental disorders such as inflammatory bowel dis-
eases (IBD), diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
autoimmune arthritis and depression [11–13]. There are 
several ways to ascertain the composition and diversity 
of the GMB due to the development of next-generation 
sequencing technology. For example, DNA microarrays, 
fluorescence in situ hybridization, and sequencing of 16S 
rRNA gene or its amplicons are all methods based on 
sequence divergences in small subunit ribosomal RNA 
[14, 15]. Metagenomic or shotgun sequencing is another 
method that randomly sequences all DNA extracted from 
the sample, which provides more accurate taxonomic res-
olution, information about the potential function of the 
microbiome, as well as identification of microbial taxa 
at the species level [16, 17]. By using shotgun sequenc-
ing on patients’ feces, Qian et al. [18] developed the first 
gut microbial gene catalog as diagnostic biomarkers of 
Parkinson’s disease. The gut microbial dysbiosis and the 
underlying pathogenesis of diseases such as diabetes, IBD 
and tuberculosis were further revealed through multi-
omics sequencing [19]. Notably, the development of 
microbial sequencing contributes to the development of 
prediction, diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.
A close pathogenic association exists between the 
intestinal microbiota and kidney diseases (gut-kidney 
axis) like chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, 
glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and IgA 
nephropathy, among others [20]. Patients with CKD, IgA 
nephropathy or gout have a characteristic GMB dysbio-
sis [21–23]. Several studies have actively performed gut 
microbiota sequencing analysis in patients with stones 
and have established that the gut microbiota is closely 
associated with stone formation. However, the charac-
teristics of GMB dysbiosis in patients with stones remain 
unclear due to variant sample sizes, analysis methods and 
individual differences. For the first time, we analyze the 
altered gut microbiota composition in patients with kid-
ney stones by conducting a meta-analysis. In addition, we 
qualitatively summarized the altered diversity, genetic 
functions and detection capability of GMB in KS patients 
and discussed the role of diet in the gut-nephrolithiasis 
axis, as well as promising therapies based on the modula-
tion of gut microbiota to provide potential strategies for 
the prevention and treatment of kidney stones.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted 
following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and 
registered at PROSPERO (No. CRD42022367346).
Search strategy and study selection
Two members of our team independently searched scien-
tific databases namely PubMed, Scopus, Medline, CIN-
HAL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from 
their inception through September 2022, in consultation 
with a sciences research librarian. Full search terms and 
an example of the search strategy can be found in (Sup-
plementary Table  1). Additional articles were searched 
for in the reference lists of the included studies, system-
atic reviews, and meta-analyses.
Two members screened the titles and abstracts inde-
pendently and read the full text of potentially relevant 
articles carefully. Articles were included if (1) they were 
original research that examined the gut microbiota from 
kidney stone patients and compared that to controls; (2) 
they reported on the microbial community from stool 
samples. We excluded studies if (1) they were animal or 
in-vitro studies, commentaries, reviews, meta-analyses 
or editorials; (2) they detected microbiome from urine 
or stones samples; (3) they included populations hav-
ing received chemotherapy within the previous year, or 
reporting antibiotic use recently.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome was differences in the abundance 
of gut microbiota between KS patients and healthy sub-
jects at the genus level. The secondary outcomes were 
descriptions of the gut microbial diversity, potential 
detection capability and genetic functions in each study.
Data extraction and quality assessment
The following information was extracted from the 
included articles by two independent reviewers: the 
first author’s name, the publication year, the nation, the 
sample size, microbiota species, statistically significant 
(P < 0.05) relative abundance at the taxonomic level of the 
gut microbiota between the groups. Disagreements were 
Page 3 of 13
Yuan et al. BMC Microbiology          (2023) 23:143 
 
discussed until a consensus was reached. Alternatively, a 
third reviewer was able to fix them.
The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess 
the quality of the studies [24]. The scale contains eight 
elements to assess the selection, comparability and iden-
tification of exposure of the groups. With a total score of 
9, studies were rated as low quality (0–5) or high quality 
(6–9); low quality studies were excluded.
Statistical analysis
For continuous outcomes, the relative abundance of gut 
microbiota, we collected the aggregate mean, standard 
deviation (SD) and standard error (SE) for quantitative 
synthesis to obtain the overall percentage of different 
microbial genera in KS patients and the controls. We also 
contacted the authors of original studies to obtain the 
data not available in the article. The relative abundance 
of gut microbes in kidney stone patients compared to 
healthy subjects was determined by calculating the differ-
ence in percentage of several genera between the KS and 
the control group. For the diversity, potential detection 
capability and genetic functions of gut microbiota, we 
only conducted qualitative synthesis because of the small 
sample sizes and the insufficient data.
All statistical analyses in this study were performed 
using the RevMan5.3 statistical software with the inverse-
variance method. Forest plots represented the summary 
metrics. The  I2 statistic was used to measure statistical 
heterogeneity between studies [25]. Sensitivity analysis 
was performed by excluding one study at a time to ensure 
the stability and accuracy of the study. The funnel plot 
and begg’s test were utilized to evaluate publication bias, 
even though there might only be a few studies included 
in subgroup analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant [26].
Results
Study selection, characteristics and quality of included 
studies
A total of eight articles [27–34] were included. The selec-
tion process of studies is depicted in Fig. 1. Studies were 
mainly from China, the USA, Italy and India and account 
for 703 samples (356 stone patients and 347 controls). 
All eight studies were observational cohort studies. All

eligible studies used stool samples for gut microbiota 
analysis via high-throughput molecular approaches by 
Illumina platforms (MiSeq, NextSeq, HiSeq). In addi-
tion to 16S rRNA sequencing, two studies combined 
shotgun sequencing [30], frc-gene amplicon sequencing 
and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fin-
gerprinting [33] to characterize microorganisms. Three 
studies [28, 29, 34] failed to report α and β diversity. 
Intestinal flora differed between patients and controls in 
the included studies, but the specific genera were highly 
variable and listed in Table  1. All eight of the articles 
received a NOS score of seven or higher, indicating high 
quality (Supplementary Table  2). The funnel plot and 
begg’s test suggested there were no publication bias for 
included studies (P for begg’s test = 0.734) (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4).
Relative abundance of gut microbiota composition
Bacteroides
The random-effects meta-analysis of Bacteroides was 
conducted using data from four studies [27–30] and 
revealed the following abundance: 35.11% (95% CI, 
22.85–47.38,  I2 = 97%) in KS patients and 21.25% (95% CI, 
-3.37–45.87,  I2 = 100%) in the control group (Fig. 2). The 
overall effect size was moderate and significant (Z = 3.56, 
P = 0.0004), indicating that Bacteroides was more abun-
dant in KS patients, the percentage of the KS group was 
1. 65-fold higher compared to the control group. Sensi-
tive analysis was done due to obvious heterogeneity (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1).
Escherichia_Shigella
Three studies [27–29] were included in the meta-anal-
ysis of Escherichia_Shigella (Fig.  3). In the KS group, 
Escherichia_Shigella made up 4.39% of the total micro-
biota detected (95% CI, 2.29–6.49,  I2 = 88%), while in 
the control group, it made up 1.78% (95% CI, 0.42–3.14, 
 I2 = 90%). The overall effect size was moderate and sig-
nificant (Z = 3.23, P = 0.001), showing that Escheri-
chia_Shigella was more abundant in the KS patients, the 
percentage of the KS group was 2.47-fold higher com-
pared to the control group. Sensitive analysis was done 
due to obvious heterogeneity (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Prevotella_9
The meta-analysis of Prevotella_9 included three studies 
[27–29] (Fig. 4). In the KS group, Prevotella_9 accounted 
for 8.41% of the total microbiota detected (95% CI, 4.99–
11.83,  I2 = 74%), and in the control groups, it accounted 
for 10.65% (95% CI, 2.10–19.20,  I2 = 96%). The over-
all effect size was moderate and significant (Z = 4.49, 
P < 0.0001), showing that Prevotella_9 was less prevalent 
in KS patients than in controls, the percentage of the 
KS group was 0.77-fold lower compared to the control 
group. Sensitive analysis was done due to obvious hetero-
geneity (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Diversity and richness of gut microbiota in KS patients 
compared to controls
The number (richness) and distribution (evenness) of 
taxa within a sample are measured by alpha diversity 
[35]. Inconsistent results of α-diversity were reported 
in five articles [27, 30–33], of which three [27, 31, 33] 
observed no significant difference between the KS and 
control groups. One study [30] reported that α-diversity 
(Chao1 index) was significantly reduced in patients with 
stones (P = 0.02). Yuan et  al. [32] reported increased 
α-diversity in stone patients relative to controls (P < 0.05), 
they found that in the KS group, the Simpson (P = 0.026), 
Ace (P < 0.01) and Chao (P < 0.05) indices were remark-
ably higher, while Shannon’s index was not significantly 
different from the control group (P > 0.05).
Beta diversity is a diversity indicator that shows how 
different or similar the microbial compositions of mul-
tiple samples are [35]. Five articles [27, 30–33] reported 
results for β-diversity by PCA, PCoA or NMDS based on 
Bray–Curtis, weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance 
metrics. Of the five, four studies [30–33] reported obvi-
ously compositional differences of the overall microbial 
communities between kidney stone patients and controls 
(P < 0.05).
Potential detection of kidney stones on gut microbiota 
characteristics
Three studies used receiver-operating characteristic 
curve (ROC) analysis to identify whether the gut micro-
biota could be used to distinguish between the two 
groups. Five genera of the gut microbiota were found to 
be biomarkers for calcium oxalate stones by Chen et al. 
[31]: Bacteroides, Phascolarctobacterium, Faecalibacte-
rium, Akkermansia, and Lactobacillus (AUC = 0.871 CI, 
0.785–0.957). According to Tang et al. [27], P. aeruginosa 
(AUC = 0.947) and Escherichia coli (AUC = 0.840) could 
be used to accurately categorize patients with nephro-
lithiasis. Xiang et al. [34] reported that the relative abun-
dances of genera Flavobacterium, Rhodobacter, Gordonia 
were found useful in predicting kidney stones (AUCs 
ranging from 0.682 to 0.763). They found that using data 
from the three genera and four clinical indicators (oxa-
late concentration, acetic acid concentration, citrate 
concentration, phosphorus concentration) together pro-
duced predictions that were more accurate than those 
made using just genus or clinical data, and random forest 
developed the most accurate model (AUC = 0.936).

Altered genetic functions of the gut microbiota in KS 
patients
Four studies reported using shotgun sequencing, func-
tional gene-targeted amplicon sequencing, or the 
bioinformatics software platform PICRUSt that the 
predicted genetic functions of KS patients were differ-
ent from the controls. Through shotgun metagenom-
ics, Ticinesi et al. [30] performed a functional analysis 
of the fecal microbiota, revealing a decreased repre-
sentation of genes involved in oxalate degradation in 
patients compared to controls (0.0021% vs 0.0041% of 
the total genome, P = 0.007), such as formyl-CoA trans-
ferase and oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase. Interestingly, 
these results were challenged by Suryavanshi et al. [33] 
who observed that the enzymes involved in oxalate 
degradation were enriched in KS patients. Tang et  al. 
[27], reported observing that the oxalate degradation 
enzymes were not statistically different from healthy 
controls to nephrolithiasis subjects (P > 0.05).
Other different functions including glycan synthesis, 
energy metabolism, co-factors metabolism, and vita-
mins metabolism, of which protein families were down-
regulated in KS patients according to Suryavanshi et al. 
[33], whereas protein families of lipid metabolism, car-
bohydrate metabolism and xenobiotic degradation and 
metabolism were up-regulated in KS subjects (P < 0.05). 
One study indicated that, compared to healthy sub-
jects, a higher abundance of metabolic pathways 
related to inflammation, lipid metabolism, xenobiotics 
biodegradation and mineral metabolism were found in 
KS patients (P < 0.05) [32].
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of the 
gut microbiota composition of patients with kidney 
stones. There are consistent results indicating a char-
acteristic gut microbiota dysbiosis in kidney stone 
patients. Identifying these dysbiosis characteristics may 
help in personalized clinical intervention. The results 
showed that, compared to healthy subjects, those with 
nephrolithiasis showed a higher relative abundance 
of genera Bacteroides and Escherichia_Shigella, and a 
lower relative abundance of genera Prevotella_9. We 
could not conduct meta-analysis of the altered dis-
tribution of other gut microbial genera due to insuf-
ficient data and limited overlap of findings. A clinical 
study reported that the expansion of Escherichia_Shi-
gella in gut was related with the onset and response 
to immunosuppressive therapy of IgA nephropathy, 
and may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker 
and therapeutic target [23]. Escherichia trended to an 
inverse correlation with urinary citrate (r =  − 0.56, 
P < 0.08) [28], which can bind free calcium and create 
soluble calcium citrate, lowering the supersaturation 
of calcium-containing salts, making it a urinary stone 
inhibitor [36]. With the decline of citrate concentra-
tion, the risk of nephrolithiasis increased. Bacteroides 
were found useful in detecting kidney stone disease 
Fig. 2 Forest plot of relative abundance of Bacteroides in kidney stone patients relative to controls
Page 8 of 13
Yuan et al. BMC Microbiology          (2023) 23:143 
[31]. Some Bacteroides can produce urease [37], which 
degrades urea and promotes the formation of ammo-
nia and carbon dioxide, leading to urine alkalinization 
and phosphate salt formation. It has been reported 
that the altered gut microbial species have been associ-
ated with various clinical parameters: the abundance of 
Bacteroides has a negative relationship with all short-
chain fatty acids (SCFAs) [31]; the abundance of Prevo-
tella negatively correlated with urine oxalate content 
[33] and is positively correlated with serum uric acid 
levels [29]. Modulating the relative abundance of gut 
microbiota based on the dysbiosis characteristics may 
be an effective therapeutic strategy for nephrolithiasis 
prevention and treatment.
Numerous other clinical disorders, such as inflamma-
tory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, type 1 and type 2 dia-
betes, have been linked to lower gut microbial diversity 
[38, 39]. However, differences in gut microbial diversity 
between kidney stone groups and controls remain incon-
clusive in this review. The β-diversity analysis of the four 
studies showed statistically significant difference between 
kidney stones and the control group, which indicated

Yuan et al. BMC Microbiology          (2023) 23:143 
 
that the microbial community structure was significantly 
different. However, the results of α-diversity measure-
ments were inconsistent among the eight studies. One 
study reported a significant reduction in α-diversity in 
patients with kidney stones compared to controls, while 
another one reported increased gut microbial α-diversity 
in stone patients relative to controls. Studies have shown 
that decreased α-diversity of gut microbiota may increase 
the risk of stone formation by reducing immunity and the 
ability to metabolize oxalate, phosphate, and citrate; an 
increase in microbial abundance in patients may reflect 
the proliferation of some potential pathogenic bacte-
ria species, through the relevant intestinal uric poison-
ous toxin concentration increase, leading to the loss and 
destruction of intestinal epithelial barrier [40], so as to 
promote the occurrence and progress of kidney disease. 
It may be due to the individual differences, insufficient 
sample size and different control of the confounding fac-
tors of the original study that lead to the inconsistent 
results of diversity. More studies with larger sample sizes 
and comparable and reproducible methods are required 
to determine the changes in intestinal microbial diversity 
in stone patients.
Advanced omics methods have enabled unprecedented 
levels of functional characterization and deep sequenc-
ing of gut microbial communities over the past ten years 
[41]. The systematic reviews suggested that functional 
activities of the gut microbiota involved in oxalate deg-
radation, lipid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, gly-
can synthesis and amino acid biosynthesis were altered in 
KS patients compared to controls. The studies established 
that the gut-nephrolithiasis axis is not limited to Oxalo-
bacter formigenes [30, 33]. It has been proved that urinary 
oxalate is a crucial risk factor for kidney stones [42, 43]. 
The intestinal tract plays a significant role in oxalate bal-
ance and subsequent oxalate homeostasis [44, 45]. Gut 
microbiota with oxalate degradation properties (Oxalo-
bacter, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus) may inhibit 
stone formation through extra-renal elimination of oxa-
late in the intestines and decreasing the oxalate concen-
tration in plasma and urine [46]. Genes involved in lipid 
metabolism were enriched in stone patients, which indi-
cated that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may contribute to 
stone formation by promoting lipid metabolism. Several 
studies have suggested that some fatty acid supplements 
improve gut microbial diversity and thus improve dis-
eases including nervous system disorders and alcoholic 
liver disease [47, 48], and N-3 fatty acid supplementation 
has been shown to reduce the levels of important stone 
risk factors, namely, hypercalciuria [49–51], hyperoxalu-
ria [52]. Glycan synthesis functions of altered gut micro-
biota were observed to be downregulated. Hyperglycemia 
may contribute to the development of nephrolithiasis 
[53] by changing hydro-electrolytes in 24-h urine excre-
tions, which leads to more acidic urine, a problem with 
renal acid excretion, and hypo-citraturia [54], all of which 
are significant risk factors for stone formation. Carbo-
hydrate metabolism disorder caused by gut microbiota 
dysbiosis delivers a marked acid load to the kidney, might 
decrease calcium balance and increase the risk for stone 
formation [55]. Overall, the predicted gene functional 
profile suggests that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may 
contribute to stone formation by breaking the metabolic 
homeostasis, and may be considered for developing new 
therapeutic strategies. At the meantime, to further clar-
ify the relationship of the gut microbiota, host metabo-
lism and stone formation, more thorough investigations 
using shotgun metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and 
metaproteomics are required.
The metagenome-wide association study conducted 
by Zhernakova et  al. has shown that inter-individual 
variations in gut microbiota composition are linked to a 
number of factors, including lifestyle, diet, diseases, and 
medications, of which dietary factors are the most crucial 
[56]. Dietary patterns like high tea consumption reduce 
the abundance of Akkermansia spp. and Lactobacillus 
spp. to promote the formation of calcium oxalate renal 
calculi [31]. Shikany’s team [57] reported the Prevotella 
enterotype to be associated with low nephrolithiasis risk 
dietary patterns characterized by a high-carbohydrate 
diet, while the Bacteroides enterotype was associated 
with high nephrolithiasis risk dietary patterns character-
ized by a high intake of animal protein [58]. Several stud-
ies have shown that high fiber intake also modulates the 
composition of the gut microbiota, increasing the num-
ber of the SCFA-producing species Lactobacillus and 
other health-promoting species [59–61], some of which 
possess characteristics of oxalate degradation. Although 
few studies have specifically focused on the role of die-
tary patterns in the gut-nephrolithiasis axis, the stone-
promoting effects of high salt, high oxalate intake, and 
the stone-preventing effects of increasing fruit, vegetable, 
juice and water intake, are at least in part mediated by 
altered gut microbiota composition and metabolic func-
tion [62]. Therefore, we believe that for high-risk groups, 
increasing the intake of fruits, vegetables, fiber and car-
bohydrates, and reducing that of tea and animal protein 
can prevent the formation and recurrence of stones. 
However, as nutrients are not consumed in isolation, 
the complex interplay between dietary factors of overall 
dietary patterns is far from being fully understood, and 
further research is needed to address these issues.
The above analysis provides us with further insights 
into the prevention and treatment of kidney stones. 
Restoring gut dysbiosis to maintain the balance of oxalate, 
citrate, and lipid metabolism may become a promising

treatment for kidney stones. Antibiotics are proven to 
be effective in gut microbiota modulation by preventing 
pathogenic bacteria, but they also kill beneficial micro-
bial communities and lead to antibiotic resistance in 
harmful bacteria [63]. The use of oral probiotic prepara-
tions, including Oxalobacter formigenes, Lactobacillus, 
Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, or other oxalate-lowering 
bacteria, alone or in combination, resulted in a reduction 
in urinary oxalate excretion in humans and rodents [64]. 
Miller et al. [65] recently transplanted oxalate-degrading 
bacteria into a laboratory rat, showing that whole com-
munity microbial transplantation is an effective method 
to colonize oxalate-degrading bacteria continuously in 
mammalian intestinal tract. Growing evidence supports 
Lactiplantibacillus Plantarum’s ability to prevent kidney 
stone formation. Probiotic Lactiplantibacillus Plantarum 
N-1 prevented kidney stones caused by ethylene glycol by 
regulating the gut microbiota and improving intestinal 
barrier function [66], Lactiplantibacillus Plantarum J-15 
corrected metabolic disorder, protected intestinal bar-
rier function, and reduced inflammation to prevent stone 
formation [67]. Synbiotic supplementation improved the 
total oxalate-degrading activity of gut microbiota, result-
ing in decreased oxalate excretion in rats [68]. The safety 
and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation have been 
demonstrated in the treatment of diseases such as meta-
bolic syndrome, diabetes, cancer and Parkinson’s disease 
[69]. In the future, we will also look forward to personal-
ized fecal microbiota transplantation strategies accord-
ing to the condition of stone patients. Although most of 
the current studies are based on animal experiments, the 
appropriate dietary intervention has been proven a con-
tribution in the prevention of recurrent stones in humans 
[62]. It may be more effective to take into account the 
characteristics of GMB of individual patients when for-
mulating individualized therapeutic strategies in future 
clinical interventions (Fig. 5).
This study is limited in that the number of studies and 
samples restricts the meta-analysis of more microbial 
species, and thus, more studies with larger sample sizes 
in this field are required to obtain more specific data on 
characteristic dysbiosis. In the included studies, only the 
effects of chemotherapy and antibiotics on intestinal flora 
were excluded; confounding variables like food and geog-
raphy were not taken into account. Some of the included 
studies did not distinguish between primary and recur-
rent kidney stone formation and did not distinguish 
between the types of stones.
Conclusions
Kidney stone patients have a characteristic gut micro-
biota dysbiosis with higher relative abundance of Bacte-
roides and Escherichia_Shigella, lower relative abundance 
of Prevotella_9. The dysbiotic gut affects the formation 
of stone by regulating the host metabolism, particularly 
oxalate metabolism. Gut microbiota characteristics com-
bined with clinical indicators help predict the occur-
rence and recurrence of kidney stones. High protein, tea, 
low carbohydrate, juice or fiber intake are risk factors 
for stone formation. Individualized therapies like fecal
