Strategies for functional polymeric nanocomposites and its
multifunctional applications
1 Introduction
The development of nanomaterial’s has greatly contributed to the development of
modern medicine and optics, and polymers are an important support and branch of
nanomaterial’s. They are non-toxic and harmless, can be degraded into small fragments
in the body, and are ﬁnally excreted without causing inﬂammation. Due to their many
advantages, biodegradable polymers have attracted more and more attention. In this
Research Topic, we focus on reviewing and introducing some polymers for wound
repair, drug loading or with special optical properties. These articles are categorized into
three themes: 1) polydopamine for wound repair; 2) dendrimers as drug carriers; 3) optical
polymers.
2 Polydopamine for wound repair
Polydopamine (PDA) is an important class of biomimetic polymers, which has good
application prospects in the ﬁeld of biomedicine. This subtopic covers a review of advances
in the application of polydopamine (PDA) in the ﬁeld of wound repair. PDA is a competitive
candidate for wound dressings due to its excellent biocompatibility and biomimetic three-
dimensional porous structure.
Herein, Cui et al. reviewed the application and development of PDA for wound
hemostasis, healing and infection treatment in recent years. PDA has strong absorption
in the near-infrared light region, which can convert light energy into heat energy and realize
photothermal therapy for sterilization. The catechol group in PDA has good coordination
and chelation ability and can coordinate with many metal ions, such as Fe3+, Ag+ and so on.

NIR-induced
metal-coordinated
PDA
composites
produce
peroxidase-like (POD)-like activity, which generates hydroxyl
radicals (•OH) and releases metal ions, exhibiting excellent
antibacterial properties. The catechol group in PDA interacts
with the reactive residues of proteins or polysaccharides in blood,
which can accelerate blood coagulation and achieve hemostasis. In
addition, the combination of catechol group proteins can form a
protective physical barrier to prevent the invasion of foreign
microorganisms, provide protection for wounds, and at the same
time inhibit the growth of bacteria and play an antibacterial effect. It
can promote the transformation of macrophages from M1 type to
M2 type, and has excellent anti-inﬂammatory, antibacterial,
antioxidant, hemostatic properties and biocompatibility. Studies
have shown that PDA coating can induce synergistic interactions
of interface components, modify the interface properties of
inorganic
nanoparticles,
and
improve
the
adhesion
of
the
material to platelets and red blood cells.
3 Dendrimers as drug carriers
Polymers are the cornerstone of various sustained-release and
controlled-release drugs. Furosemide (FRSD) is a loop diuretic (4-
chloro- n -furyl-5-sulfamoylaminobenzoic acid) used orally for the
treatment of edema associated with cardiac, renal, and hepatic
failure, and hypertension. According to the BCS classiﬁcation
system, FRSD has low oral bioavailability and solubility. It is
rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with a half-life of
30–120 min. Its bioavailability is about 60%–70%, but its absorption
is variable and unstable. Murugan et al. synthesized two quaternary
ammonium-based polyamidoamine dendrimers and used them as
drug carriers to load FRSD. The surface amine modiﬁcation and
internal
quaternization
of
PAMAM
dendrimers
played
an
important role in improving the dendrimer solubility and drug
release. Moreover, the cytotoxicity is signiﬁcantly reduced and the
biocompatibility is improved. Therefore, the development of
quaternary ammonium polyamidoamine dendrimers can provide
new ideas for the development of new dendrimer drug delivery
platforms in the future.
4 Optical polymers
Porphyrin-based polymers are excellent non-linear optical
(NLO) materials due to their unique conjugated structure, good
thermal stability, and narrow band gap. Liang et al. constructed a
ﬂurry
of
original
porphyrin-based
polymers
covalently
functionalized
g-C3N4
nanohybrids
through
click
chemistry
between
porphyrin-based
polymers
with
alkyne
end-groups
[(PPorx-C≡CH (x = 1, 2 and 3)] and azide-functionalized
graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4-N3), which was nominated as
PPorx-g-C3N4 (x = 1, 2 and 3). Due to the photoinduced
electron
transfer
(PET)
between
porphyrin-based
polymers
[PPorx (x = 1, 2 and 3)] group and graphite phase carbon
nitride (g-C3N4) group in PPorx-g-C3N4 nanohybrids, the PPorx-
g-C3N4 nanohybrids exhibited better non-linear optical (NLO)
performance than the corresponding PPorx-C≡CH and g-C3N4-
N3. It found that the imaginary third-order susceptibility (Im [χ(3)])
value of the nanohybrids with different molecular weight (MW) of
the PPorx group in the nanohybrids ranged from 2.5 × 103 to 7.0 ×
103 g mol−1 was disparate. Quite interestingly, the Im [χ(3)] value of
the nanohybrid with a PPorx group’s MW of 4.2 × 103 g mol−1
(PPor2-g-C3N4) was 1.47 × 10−10 esu, which exhibited the best NLO
performance in methyl methacrylate (MMA) of all nanohybrids.
The PPorx-g-C3N4 was dispersed in polymethyl methacrylate
(PMMA) to prepare the composites PPorx-g-C3N4/PMMA since
PMMA was widely used as an alternative to glass. It suggested that
PPorx-g-C3N4 nanohybrids were potential outstanding NLO
materials. This study provided a new strategy for the design of
porphyrin-based nanohybrids, which could ﬁnd wider applications
in the ﬁeld of NLO materials.
