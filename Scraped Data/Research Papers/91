1 Introduction
According to the World Health Organization, there were almost 18 million patients living with
cancer in 2020. It is estimated that over 14 million patients will require oncologic surgery in
2040. This is a 52% increase from 2018 estimations.1 Due to the importance of a complete (R0)
resection on survival and the increase in detection of early-stage disease, surgical resection
remains an important treatment of solid tumors.2,3 Achieving an R0 resection and identifying
disease in lymph nodes or synchronous lesions has been shown repeatedly to improve oncologic
outcomes and is a mainstay of curative-intent treatment.4 However, achieving these margins and
finding residual disease during surgery remains a challenge for surgical oncologists. This is
mainly due to the inability to see microscopic disease left behind and, at times, uncertainty about
involvement of vital structures.
Intraoperative molecular imaging (IMI) has emerged as a technology to improve intraoper-
ative localization of lesions during cancer surgery (Fig. 1). IMI has been shown to help iden-
tifying synchronous disease, detecting occult disease, and confirming a negative margin.5 The
agents and imaging techniques used in IMI vary. They can be a fluorescent contrast agent that
can be nonspecifc, targeted, or activated (Table 1). These are agents that are injected intra-
venously preoperatively, and when excited with a laser, emit a wavelength that is detected
by a photon detector. There are other label-free techniques that leverage the autofluorescent
properties of proteins. Other techniques do not rely on a contrast agent but on photoacoustics.
However, these methods are still under development. Ideally, surgeons try to preserve as much
normal parenchyma as possible, a strategy that is most important in areas where regeneration of
the tumor is limited, such as the brain. In these scenarios, IMI delineates the area of interest and
specifies resection margins.
IMI-guided surgery has three requisites: a targeted fluorophore that can be injected systemi-
cally and delivered to a tumor, a laser capable of emitting a desired wavelength, and a camera
capable of detecting the fluorescence emitted from the cancer. Over the last two decades, these
components have each been developed to identify different targets and have had increased clini-
cal implementation. Although traditional imaging is mostly in the visible wavelengths, IMI relies
heavily on the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength because it allows deeper tissue penetration and
decreased background fluorescence.6 The cameras are also specific as they tend to detect the
emitted wavelength from the fluorophore but are typically available in most institutions for more
perfusion measurements. Delivering the fluorescent dyes falls into one of three major strategies.
The first is passive targeting, which relies on enhanced permeability and retention (EPR),

whereby the dye preferentially accumulates in the tumor tissue due to leaky vasculature.7 A more
specific approach to tumor targeting is to target a specific receptor or enzyme that is overex-
pressed in tumors. A third class of “activatable” dyes take advantage of tumor-specific micro-
environments or enzymes to become activated.
Currently, two agents have already obtained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval
for use in oncologic resections: 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) and pafolacianine (OTL-38). 5-
ALA has been approved for high-grade gliomas in 2017. Subsequently, pafolacianine was
approved for ovarian cancer in November 2021 and for lung cancer in December 2022.8–10
Currently, many other cancer-specific dyes are being investigated under clinical trials. The

current research focuses on fine-tuning these dyes to overcome some of the challenges with
previous dyes, such as depth penetration and background noise.11 Also, there is increased interest
in “normal-tissue” dyes that would help not only in oncologic surgery but also in delineating
normal anatomy in surgically challenging or reoperative fields. From an imaging standpoint,
there is a need to develop better cameras that can decrease background on the one hand and
ideally identify several emission wavelengths on the other.
To consolidate the wealth of knowledge and research we have at this time and encourage
collaborative growth, a group of 300 researchers and industry partners from all over the United
States and the world came together in Philadelphia on November 11, 2022. This was the third
biennial IMI conference hosted at the University of Pennsylvania. The goal of the conference
was to present the current clinical advances including FDA approvals, phase 3, phase 2, phase 1,
and preclinical work pertaining to IMI. The clinicians shared their real-time experience with this
technology and demonstrated its direct impact on patient care and oncologic outcomes. There
was also a demonstration of the gradual stages of drug development and applications across
different specialties. This paper summarizes the main points in the discussions surrounding the
most recent advances in IMI.
2 FDA-Approved Agents
2.1 Summary of Main Points
• A clinically significant event (CSE) is defined as: localization of a tumor that was not
detectable by traditional white light or tactile sensation, identification of a synchronous
lesion, or identification of a positive margin.
• 5-ALA
•
FDA approved for fluoresce-guided resection of high-grade gliomas and may have
applications in ovarian and breast cancer.
•
The triple-LED/loupe system to be a useful adjunct to surgeons who prefer loupes to
microscopes during surgical resection.
• Pafolacianine (OTL38)
•
IMI is a valuable adjunct to help achieve maximal cytoreduction and improve patient
prognoses in ovarian cancer.
•
Using OTL38 altered the operative plan in 56% of patients with ovarian cancer and
led to a more complete debulking in 50.5% of patients.
•
Fifty-four percent of patients with lung cancer undergoing IMI and a wedge or
a segmental resection with OTL38 had a CSE; 29% of patients had a change in
operative course based on IMI findings.
2.2 5-ALA in Europe: Fluorescence-Guided Resection of Meningiomas
In 2017, the US FDA approved 5-aminoleuvulinic acid (5-ALA) for fluorescence-guided resec-
tion of high-grade gliomas.12 5-ALA is a prodrug that is metabolized in tumor cells to produce
protoporphyrin-IX (PPIX), which is the fluorescent moiety that will remain in the cells. As such,
PPIX is not found in the bloodstream, and fluorescence does not leak into normal brain tissue,
yielding minimal background signal. With a positive-predictive value (PPV) of 98%, 5-ALA can
serve as a guide to the surgeon who can follow the fluorescence in the brain leading to the glioma
tissue.13 Dr. Walter Stummer, MD, PhD, from Munster University Hospital, provided updates
regarding imaging devices, target populations, and expanding indications for the use of 5-ALA
(ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT00241670).
Dr. Stummer presented new loupe devices (Reveal FGS; Design for Vision, Inc.), which are
more closely related to microscopes than exoscopes, allowing the surgeon to view the fluores-
cence without any intervening cameras.13 The loupes include three diodes: white light, 450 nm,

and 405 nm (excitation peak of protoporphyrin). In 2021, Dr. Stummer validated the technical
measures of the device showing that the performance of the loupes regarding fluorescence dis-
crimination were equivalent to a conventional Kinevo surgical microscope (Carl Zeiss, Meditec).
The loupes, however, demonstrated a much stronger fluorescence and background brightness
when both systems were compared using an artificial eye for determining fluorescence intensity
as seen by surgeons. Furthermore, they provided clinical validation by comparing fluorescence
of freshy extracted tissue with both systems and found equivalent signal. While the loupes pro-
vided 10× the fluorescence brightness of conventional microscopes, the downside was that the
surgeon was unable to visualize deep cavities. As such, the triple-LED/loupe system is a useful
adjunct to surgeons who prefer loupes to microscopes during surgical resection.
While the FDA has approved the use of 5-ALA for high-grade glioma resection in adult
patients, little is known about its safety and efficacy in pediatric patients.14,15 As such,
Dr. Stummer then discussed an ongoing safety trial involving eight institutions across Germany
and the United Kingdom. It aims to enroll patients with a wide range of pediatric brain tumors
and is currently recruiting additional patients to complete the study.
Finally, Dr. Stummer discussed the expanding indications for 5-ALA guided resection. While
meningiomas are commonly benign conditions, maximal resection is critical to prevent recur-
rence and progression to more malignant grades.15 Stummer et al. described the NXDC-
MEN-301 phase 3 open-label single-arm study investigating the safety and efficacy of 5-ALA
for visualization of meningiomas during resection.16 The primary outcome measure for that
study is the proportion of participants who have one or more indeterminate tissue of unexpected
fluorescence at the end of surgery where 5-ALA fluorescence is consistent with histology. He
described the blinding design of the study, i.e., recording all assessments during the study and
providing these images to a blinded panel. He explained that the enrollment of subjects is nearly
complete. Finally, he mentioned trials for 5-ALA in ovarian cancer and breast cancer, illustrating
the potential expanding indications.
2.3 Pafolacianine for Ovarian Cancer
Dr. Janos L. Tanyi from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania
discussed the results of the phase 3 study assessing the efficacy of pafolacianine sodium injection
(OTL38) for the IMI of ovarian cancer. OTL38 is a folic acid analog conjugated to an indo-
cyanine green-like dye (excitation wavelength of 774 nm and emission wavelength of
794 nm) that works by leveraging the tumor-specific overexpression of folate receptor alpha
(FRα). FRα is overexpressed in many solid malignancies, including ovarian cancer, where
over 97% of high-grade ovarian cancers are known to overexpress the protein in moderate to
high levels.
Dr. Tanyi summarized the phase 1 and 2 studies that identified the optimal dose of OTL38
(0.025 mg∕kg) and time window of administration (>1 h before surgery). It also showed that
OTL38 helped identify additional lesions that were not detected by visual inspection or white
light in 49.3% of patients with ovarian cancer. The phase 3 study was an open-label, single-
dose, randomized prospective trial across 11 tertiary care cancer centers. (ClinicalTrials.gov,
no. NCT03180307). The primary objective of the study was to confirm the efficacy of
OTL38 with intraoperative NIR fluorescence imaging to detect additional FRαþ ovarian cancer
lesions that were not detectable by normal white light and palpation. The secondary objectives of
the study were to estimate the sensitivity and false-positive rate of OTL38 and assess safety. A
total of 150 patients were infused, with 109 patients analyzed for the primary and secondary
endpoints, and it was found that 33% of patients had ≥1 FRαþ ovarian cancer lesion detected
by intraoperative fluorescence imaging that was not originally planned for resection based on
white light and palpation. OTL38 showed an overall sensitivity and false-positive rate of 83%
and
32.7%,
respectively,
with
post-hoc
analysis
showing
a
sensitivity
and
false-
positive rate of 86.5% and 28.5% when adjusted for high-volume surgeons. There were no
drug-related serious adverse events, with the most common events including mild to moderate
levels of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Dr. Tanyi concluded his presentation by sharing
investigator reported outcomes in a postprocedural questionnaire, which showed that intraoper-
ative fluorescence led to the revision of the surgical plan in 56% of cases and to a more complete

debulking in 50.5% of patients. The phase 3 study results made a compelling argument for the
use of OTL38 and intraoperative fluorescence imaging as an adjunct to achieve maximal cytor-
eduction and improve patient prognoses.
2.4 Pafolacianine for Lung Cancer: Enabling Lung Cancer Identification
Using Folate Receptor Targeting (ELUCIDATE) Trial
Dr. Linda Martin from the University of Virginia explained the challenge lung cancer surgeons
face with the increased adoption of minimally invasive techniques due to less tactile sensation.
Furthermore, she identified that localization of subpleural or a deep nodules in the lung and
ground-glass opacities is difficult. Another major challenge in thoracic surgery is intraoperative
assessment of margins which requires a significant amount of dependence on pathology which is
subject to human error.
Dr. Martin summarized the mechanism of action of pafolacianine, OTL38 (On Target
Laboratories, West Lafayette, Indiana). She explained that lung adenocarcinomas have a high
density of FRα expression.17 After undergoing cell line and animal model studies, this drug was
first used in a phase 1 study for lung cancer in 2016 and had no serious adverse events.18 It was
then evaluated in a phase 2 multi-institutional single arm study and showed improved outcomes
in 26% of patients.19 As such, the decision was made to evaluate the use of pafolacianine for
lung cancer in a multi-institutional randomized, phase 3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov, no.
NCT04241315).
Patients were eligible if they were suspected to have lung cancer, planned to undergo a min-
imally invasive surgery, and planned to undergo sub-lobar resection initially with the possibility
of proceeding to a lobectomy based on surgeon judgment. Patients (n ¼ 112) consented to the
study and received a preoperative infusion of pafolcianine 1 to 24 h prior to surgery. Then, they
proceeded to the operating room. First, they underwent thoracoscopic evaluation to identify
lesions and included using finger palpation if needed and possible. Whether or not a lesion was
identified was recorded. Subsequently, the patients underwent a randomization of 1:10 as speci-
fied by the FDA, where the NIR camera was not turned on for 1 patient but was turned on for 10.
Patients acted as their own controls and all results were confirmed by the pathology lab. There
were 12 participating institutions: The University of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, University of Iowa, Allegheny General
Hospital, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, University of
Virginia, University of Michigan Medical Center, Stamford Medical Center, and Swedish
Cancer Institute.
The primary endpoint was identification of a CSE defined as: either localization of primary
nodule that was not detected under normal light or palpation using standard techniques or iden-
tification of a synchronous lesion that was not detected under normal light or palpation using
standard techniques, or identification of a positive or close margin that was within 10 mm of the
surgical staple line when the specimen is evaluated on the back table. The latter helped surgeons
to decide whether the margin was close and there was a need to proceed with a wider resection. In
terms of demographics, the patients were the typical cohort seen with smoking history (around
70% current or former), mostly adenocarcinoma (typical of peripheral tumors) and 19% with
metastatic disease from non-lung primary, such as colorectal cancer or sarcoma. The surgical
procedures were wedge, segmentectomy, lobectomy, or no resection (multiple nodules not
amenable to surgical resection). Half were robotic and half were traditional video-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery. The drug was mostly safe and tolerable. The most common side effects
were nausea or vomiting, hypertension, and hypotension. Eleven had infusion-related reaction
and four did not finish the infusion because they had a rash. There were no long-term threatening
side effects from the drug infusion.
The results of the study showed that 54% of CSE were identified and there were more than
one CSE in some patients. 29% of patients had a change in operative course based on IMI find-
ings. For localization, 19% of the primary lesions were not identified with white light but were
identifiable with NIR. In 9% of patients, a second or third lesion was identified, the majority
of which were outside the planned area of resection. In 38% of patients, the margins assessed
by NIR were within close proximity of the planned margin. This was 84% concordant with

pathology readings. The secondary endpoint included the positive predictive value of pafolacia-
nine: 99% in identifying primary lesions and 40% for synchronous lesions. The false positives
observed were granulomas, intraparenchymal (IP) lymph nodes, and anthracotic nodules.
3 Phase 3 Trials
3.1 Summary of Main Points
• CEA-targeted fluorescent probe (SGM101)
•
Safe and feasible for detection of colorectal cancer in patients with an R1 resection
and allows for a guided resection.
•
Valuable adjunct in recurrent colorectal cancer with increased scarring and difficult to
visualize operative fields.
• Pegulicianine
•
In breast cancer, it improved tumor prediction in shave margin compared with routine
pathological assessment of the lumpectomy specimen.
•
Pegulicianine-guided surgery reduces the need for re-excision by 19% (Table 2).
3.2 CEA Use for Colon Cancer in a European Phase 3 Trial
Dr. Alexander Vahrmeijier from Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) presented that IMI
was first implemented in 2009 for SLN in breast cancer at LUMC, but then IMI transitioned to
colon cancer in 2019. In their study, the group utilized the Artemis and Spectrum fluorescence
imaging systems (Quest Medical Imaging, Middenmeer, The Netherlands). An anti-carcino-
embryonic antigen (CEA) was chosen to be tagged to a fluorophore because it is expressed
on around 80% to 90% of all colorectal cancer. Its expression is also not affected by radiation
therapy (RT) or chemotherapy. Initially in the phases 1 and 2 trial, 10 mg SGM-101 (dye-
targeted against CEA) was injected 4 days prior to the surgical procedure and was able to detect
the primary colonic tumor along with the metastatic deposit in the liver.20 Intraoperatively,
tumors that were visible under white light are then observed under NIR and a fusion image
of both were then seen intraoperatively as well. This allowed to visualize the gross resected
margins in real time. They then confirmed on pathologic evaluation.
In recurrent rectal cancer cases, the operative field has increased scarring and it is more dif-
ficult to distinguish areas of concerns. The use of NIR allows to visualize areas that had an R1
resection and allows a guided resection. It also allows the visualization of distant metastatic
colorectal cancer deposits in the lung. In the phase 2 trial, there were 37 patients enrolled with
primary and recurrent colorectal cancer. As a result of NIR, eight additional malignant lesions
were identified in six patients, and there was a change of surgical plan in 24% (9/37) patients
where seven needed additional resections and two required downstaging in treatment.21 SGM-
101 was able to impact a change in surgical plan in one of four patients.
Given the promising results in the phases 1 and 2 trial, the group is currently performing a
phase 3 trial. The study aims to enroll a total of 300 patients between Italy, Germany, the
Netherlands, and the United States. Indications include clinical T3 or T4 colorectal tumors and
recurrent disease with peritoneal carcinomatosis. It is randomized in a 1:4 fashion where one patient

does not receive SGM-101 and four others do. The process is completely blinded to the surgeon
and unblinding only happens prior to the case. At that time, the surgeon would either proceed with
NIR inspection, resect, then use NIR to rescan the area and resect further if need be or undergo the
standard surgical procedure without NIR (ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT04737213).
On a different note, Dr. Vahrmeijer explained new optical advances in developing a dual
channel camera that can detect multiple wavelengths. For instance, the Artemis and Spectrum
fluorescence imaging systems (Quest Medical Imaging, Middenmeer, The Netherlands) at this
time can detect the primary tumor with SGM-101 in the colon. When the channel is changed to
800 nm, it can image the ureter as well.
3.3 Protease Activated Dye in Breast Cancer Surgery: Phase 3 US Trial
Dr. Barbara L. Smith from Massachusetts General Hospital shared the results of two multicenter
randomized trials assessing the utility of pegulicianine guided surgery for breast cancer.
Assessing breast lumpectomy margins is uniquely challenging due to complex ductal anatomy
and is time consuming, often requiring multiple days to receive the results of the lumpectomy
and perform additional surgery when margins remain positive (20% re-excision rate).
Furthermore, standard pathology often has limited accuracy correlating positive lumpectomy
specimen margins with residual tumor in the surgical cavity. Thus, the ideal breast lumpectomy
margin assessment tool is one that has a high sensitivity for tumor detection, provides a rapid
assessment, and identifies residual tumor inside the cavity wall.
Pegulicianine (LUM015) is a cathepsin and MMP-activated fluorescent imaging agent
that preferentially accumulates in the tumor bed. Pegulicianine is administered at a dose of
1.0 mg∕kg in a 3-min IV push ∼2 to 6 h prior to surgery. After removal of the main lumpectomy
specimen, the surgical cavity is assessed using a direct visualization system (Lumicell, Inc.),
which includes a handheld intracavity probe that can detect the fluorescence emission of
pegulicianine at a wavelength of 670 nm. The imaging system has a field of view of 2.6 cm
diameter area in 1 s and currently adds <10 min to the surgical procedure time.
Dr. Smith’s team conducted an initial feasibility study with 45 breast cancer patients and 569
cavity margin images, which revealed promising results with a sensitivity of 84% for tumor in
cavity wall, specificity of 73%, and tumor : normal signal ratios between 3.52 and 5.69. This
initial study showed that the fluorescence signal was not affected by tumor histology (DCIS
versus IDC versus ILC), breast density, or menopausal status. The study also showed that pegu-
licianine had no impact on tumor histopathology or receptor determination. The next major study
conducted was a multicenter feasibility study that included 234 patients over 16 US sites, with
three to five cases per surgeon. Patients were females with either primary invasive breast cancer
or DCIS undergoing lumpectomy. The multicenter feasibility study showed a sensitivity of 69%
for predicting tumor in shave margin, compared with a sensitivity of 38% for routine pathologi-
cal assessment of the lumpectomy specimen. The study also showed a specificity of 70%, com-
pared with 91% for routine pathological assessment of the lumpectomy specimen, for predicting
tumor in the shave margin. Pegulicianine-guided surgery reduces the need for re-excision by 19%,
which would have been closer to 32% if all the surgeons in the study had excised all lumpectomy
cavity areas with fluorescent signal22 (ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT04440982).
The next multicenter trial that Dr. Smith’s team conducted was a prospective pivotal study,
which was a randomized 10:1 pegulicianine-guided surgery : control trial comprised of 406
patients across 14 US sites. The patients were again females with primary invasive breast cancer
or DCIS undergoing lumpectomy. Though the results of the study have not been published yet,
Dr. Smith highlighted that pegulicianine reduces the need for second surgeries for positive
margins and helped remove tumor missed by standard lumpectomy. On average, one additional
shave was taken when surgery was guided by pegulicianine, with an average of 10 cc of
additional tissue taken. Overall, Dr. Smith highlighted that pegulicianine had a 98% negative
predictive value, emphasizing its utility in breast lumpectomies. The next multicenter study will
assess the extent of residual tumor remaining after pegulicianine-guided surgery compared with
standard lumpectomy. It will also examine the influence of neoadjuvant endocrine or chemo-
therapy on pegulicianine-guided surgery. This study is currently undergoing patient accrual.

4.2 Anti-EGFR Antibody Imaging Strategies for Real-Time Surgical and
Pathologic Guidance
Dr. Eben Rosenthal’s group is currently evaluating the use of panitumumab conjugated to
IRDye800 for NIR surgical imaging in two settings: intraoperative real-time assessment with
an open-field system (Novadaq, Burnaby, Canada) and back table specimen assessment with
a closed-field system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, Nebraska). His group has shown that the
antibody-based tracer is specific for tumor cells and EGFRs at the whole tumor and pathologic
level.23 Data were presented to support IMI for detection of satellite lesions, determining deep
margin status, and identifying residual subclinical disease.24 This technology identified areas
suspicious for residual tumor, reducing the sampling error limits associated with frozen section
analysis when sending tissue to pathology for confirmation.23,25
Systemic administration of panitumumab-IRDye800 is also useful for staging of solid tumors
and identification of metastatic lymph nodes. Dr. Rosenthal’s clinical studies have suggested that
the anti-EGFR-labeled tracers may drain from the tumor to sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) by indi-
rect or passive drainage from the primary tumor (just as if it were directly injected). This is in
addition to the direct (hematogenous) targeting tumor-containing lymph nodes. His group has

validated that fluorescence intensity is dose dependent and metastatic nodes can be differentiated
from benign nodes. They are able to accurately stage the tumor by examining the three lymph
nodes with the highest fluorescence intensity, indicating that molecular guided surgery has the
potential to improve the workflow of staging and SLN biopsies.26,27 Data were also provided
to support the use of anti-EGFR antibodies for tumor detection using PET-based imaging.
In a trial using panitumumab conjugated to 89Zirconium, it was found that 89Zr-panitumumab
PET/CT imaging could be used to rule out false positives identified on 18F-FDG PET/CT28
(ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT02415881).
4.3 Intraoperative Molecular Imaging of Lung Cancer with Cathepsin
Imaging
Dr. Sunil Singhal from the University of Pennsylvania describes the three mechanisms of
action of IMI tracers: nonspecific or passive such as ICG, targeted receptors such as folate
receptor, and the third category is activatable probes as described by Dr. Smith earlier. The
latter are only activatable in the tumor microenvironment and are nonfluorescent if left alone.
Those can be enzyme-activated where the molecule is formed by a fluorochrome, a linker, and
a quencher. The quencher prevents the probe from fluorescing until cathepsin (one of the
enzymes selectively upregulated in tumor cells) comes in contact and cleaves the quencher,
thereby allowing the fluorochrome to become visible. The other mechanism involved is
molecular binding at which point the tracer binds the receptor, endocytosed and transported
to the lysosome where it is activated. These enzymes include cathepsins B/L, MMP, and beta
galactosidases. The advantages of activatable probes are the ability to obtain excellent reso-
lution, undergoing a quick enzymatic chemical reaction, having less side-effects due to low
doses used, having favorable pharmacokinetics, and covalently binding to the cathepsin so it is
retained at the site.
The cathepsins are a family of 11 proteases normally found in the lysosomal degradation
system and are overexpressed in cancer cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and tumor micro-
environments. Cathepsin is found in multiple cancer cell types including brain, lung, or prostate.
Preclinical studies showed that cathepsins are expressed in multiple lung cancer cell lines: lung
adenocarcinoma, large cell, adenosquamous carcinoma, and squamous cell. This is advanta-
geous as lung cancer has the most varied cancer subtypes.29
The VGT-309 (excitation 789 nm, emission 814 nm) (Vergent Bioscience, Minneapolis,
Minnesota) molecule was developed by Dr. Matt Bogyo at Stanford.30 A phenoxymethyl
ketone electrophile covalently binds cathepsin and makes it irreversible. There is also a
quencher that prevents ICG from fluorescing unless the quencher is cleaved. Since the fluo-
rophore is ICG, conventional ICG scopes can be used and those tend to be readily available at
most centers. In preclinical studies, the fluoresce of VGT-309 was found to be dose dependent
in mice and inhibited when a cathepsin inhibitor is added; 4 mg∕kg at 24 h was found to be
ideal dosing and timing. The dye is renally excreted and has minimal background except for the
spleen and kidney. Cathepsin was also found both in tumor and tumor-associated macro-
phages.29
Then, in collaboration with Dr. David Holt at the Penn School of Veterinary Medicine, canine
IMI studies of lung cancer were performed. Intraoperative imaging with white light was com-
pared with NIR and these were confirmed on pathologic specimens. The tumor did take up the
dye and lit up.29 This was followed by a phase 1 study that was done in Australia looking at
safety and tolerability. The higher doses had a long half-life as expected while being well tol-
erated with minimal side effects. A follow-up phase 2 study was done with 27 patients and the
goal was to look at timing (data unpublished at this time). Dr. Gavin Wright in Australia found
that the 0.05-mg∕kg dose was too low, and they needed to administer 0.16 and 0.32 mg∕kg to
visualize the tumor better.
At this time, there is an ongoing phase 2 efficacy study at The University of Pennsylvania.
The dose currently being used is the 0.32 mg∕kg because the tumor is better visualized at this
dose, had enough of a half-life to be administered the day before surgery, and a minimal toxicity
profile. It is a single arm study that will include 40 patients and the endpoints are identify-
ing CSEs.

4.4 pH-Sensitive Dyes in Peritoneal Surface Malignancy
Dr. Patrick Wagner from the Allegheny Health Network presented data on pegsitacianine
(OncoNano Medicine Inc., Southlake, Texas), a pH-sensitive molecular imaging agent in a phase
2 study on peritoneal carcinomatosis. Peritoneal metastasis is a pattern of metastatic cancer from
various primary sources, including appendiceal, ovarian, uterine, gastric, and colon, with a high
recurrent rate following surgery. Preoperative scans can underestimate the disease burden and
surgeons are limited to palpation and visual cues to detect all metastatic lesions in the abdomen.
Initial disease volume and completeness of surgical cytoreduction correlate with improved
patient outcomes, where a cytoreductive score is used to account for no disease present.
Given these limitations, there has been an interest in the development of intraoperative imaging.
It allows surgeons to get instantaneous feedback, is easy to use, and allows opportunities to
detect residual disease.
Pegsitacianine is activated in the acidic tumor microenvironment. It is a micellar fluorescent
molecule composed of several hundred amphiphilic unimers, which are composed of a hydro-
philic and hydrophobic segment to which ICG is conjugated. Self-assembled into micelles in
aqueous solution at physiologic pH, the ICG is sequestered and quenched in the core of the
micelle but disassembles in the acidic tumor microenvironment found in nearly all solid cancers,
turning the fluorescence ON. The phase separation and cooperativity of the unimers leads to
an all-or-nothing binary fluorescence response.31,32 It was evaluated in a phase 1 study in the
Netherlands, where it was found to be well tolerated. It was able to detect esophageal, head and
neck, breast, and colon cancer. It identified nine positive margins and two instances of occult
disease. A phase 2 study was then designed. It addressed early imaging feasibility at times <24 h
postdose administration, expansion of range of tumor types to include prostate and ovarian
cancer, and performance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma at 1 mg∕kg 24 h postdose
administration.33
There is an ongoing phase 2 study in peritoneal metastases. The primary objective of this
study is to determine if the administration of pegsitacianine (1 mg∕kg) prior to surgery results in
a CSE as previously described or alters the completeness of cytoreduction score. The secondary
objectives include the demonstration of an acceptable safety profile, reliable sensitivity, speci-
ficity, negative predictive values, and positive predictive values at the level of the individual
specimens. The study design is as follows: at day 0, pegsitacianine is infused 24 to 72 h prior
to surgery at a dose of 1 mg∕kg and rate of 10 cc∕ min. Then, at the day of surgery, the patients
undergo a standard of care surgery. This is followed by the imaging of 10 suspected tumor
nodules and five areas of normal tissue, examination of peritoneal cavity with NIR camera and
excision of additional disease. The pathologist then performs a histologic evaluation of the
specimen and calculations of the cytoreduction completion score and findings of CSE
(ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT04950166).
To date, 32 patients have undergone imaging during surgery with pegsitacianine. Disease was
detected in six tumor types: appendiceal, colorectal, mesothelioma, endometrial, pancreatic, and
ovarian. There was no significant difference in detecting mucinous versus nonmucinous disease.
The drug was well tolerated and there were no drug-related adverse events; 27% of patients had
an infusion-related transient reaction restricted to flushing. The tumor was able to take up the dye
and activate it. Small tumor deposits were detected by pegsitacianine with healthy tissues show-
ing little to no activation. The anticipated background fluorescence was observed in the liver,
spleen, small bowel, and lymph nodes. It was also able to consistently detect residual disease and
alter complete cytoreduction score. There were 466 samples with a sensitivity of 86%, NPV
78%, and FPR 27%. In terms of imaging metrics, the mean fluorescent activity of the tumor
was 2.49 compared with 1.6 for normal tissue, which was found to be statistically significant.
All the tissues were imaged in a background of normal mesenteric tissues.34 There are several
camera systems on the market compatible with ICG and pegsitacianine. In this study, the
Visionsense Iridium camera system (Visionsense EleVision) was used. Other open-air ICG com-
patible cameras have been used with pegsitacianine in the current and completed clinical trial.
In conclusion, pegsitacianine aids in the visualization of residual disease that otherwise
would have been left behind in standard of care surgery. It also alters the completeness of cytor-
eduction surgery which is correlated with improved outcomes. Some limitations include the

ability for surgeons to differentiate lymph nodes from residual disease and that there is a learning
curve to learn how to interpret fluorescence. In terms of potential future applications, Dr. Wagner
explained how it can be used to detect primary malignancies of peritoneal origin and in using this
technology for laparoscopic staging of disease and determining PCI score.
4.5 pH-Sensitive Dyes in a Phase 2 Lung Cancer Trial
Dr. David Rice from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center presented work on the
use of pegsitacianine for IMI in lung cancer. He explained that the need for a tumor agnostic,
activatable dyes stems from the fact that not all lung cancers express targetable receptors. For
example, if an agent targets folate receptors, it will pick up adenocarcinomas more so than
squamous cell carcinomas, which express the folate receptor less.35 As such, a dye that is tumor
agnostic was needed and smart tumor pH-responsive optical probes were developed.
Most of the preclinical lung cancer work was done in Dr. Singhal’s lab at the University of
Pennsylvania. Work was initially done to characterize the ideal pH and the time needed to acti-
vate the dye. The ideal pH was found to be <6.5. In murine studies, athymic mice were injected
with human cell line KB into their flanks. Pegsitacianine was then administered via tail vein
injection at various doses. It was found that 24 h was enough time for most optimal uptake.
The MFI and tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) was not different between 2 and 4 mg but was
superior to the 1-mg dose. The biodistribution to other organs showed that mostly the liver and
the spleen took up the drug but less than the tumor did. Importantly, the lungs themselves had
very low background uptake. Next, to see if this may be used across tumor cell types, AC and
SCC of lung origin into athymic mice. Both showed good uptake of the drug and fluoresced.
The tumors were excised and analyzed for uptake within the tumor. The drug appeared to be
concentrated in the periphery of the tumor and not the center. The reasons mostly likely are
related to the initial uptake of the agent with relatively poor vascularity in the center of the tumor.
The phase 1 study was done in the Netherlands and involved 30 patients. It showed uptake
across a broad range of histologic subtypes: HNSCC, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and
esophageal cancer. At this time, there is an ongoing phase 2, single-dose, open-label study
to evaluate diagnostic performance and safety of pegsitacianine in patients undergoing routine
surgery for suspected lung cancer. This single-arm study is designed to include 40 patients
infused 1-mg∕kg pegsitacianine 24 h prior to surgery. It is a multi-institutional study involving
MD Anderson Cancer Center and The University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.
Inclusion criteria are any patient with a lung mass suspicious for lung cancer and age 18 to 85.
Primary endpoints are similar to previous studies and aim to determine if there were CSEs. The
secondary endpoints are safety, toxicity, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. For example, a
GGO in the upper lobe of the right lung is hard to palpate and visualize. Intraoperatively, when
viewing this lesion, there is no tethering of the surrounding normal tissues indicative of a deeper
tumor. Using NIR, pegsitacianine is able to localize the otherwise occult disease. Also, pegsi-
tacianine was able to guide decision-making between a bilobectomy versus total pneumonec-
tomy by providing additional fluorescent information on the tumor’s extent and missed lesions
under white light.
PH activatable dyes have the advantage of being tumor agnostic and hence have a broader
application. Meanwhile, pegsitacianine is visible using commonly available camera systems
tuned to detect ICG. The preclinical data suggest efficacy with tracer uptake. At this time,
patients are being recruited for the phase 2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT05048082).

5.2 Antiepidermal Growth Factor Receptor Affibody: Design and
Implementation of a Novel Targeted Tumor Dye
Sarcomas are <1% of all cancers and derived from mesoderm, the middle germ layer. Unlike
other IMI applications where intralesional tumor removal is the standard of care (e.g., glioma),
sarcomas should be excised with a wide margin and the tumor is never directly visualized during
surgery, a technique called wide local excision. However, some of the largest series report
up to 22% positive margin rates.36 This requirement creates new challenges for applying IMI
to sarcomas.
In an effort to leverage IMI using a small-molecule NIR probe, an academic-industrial
collaboration (Affibody, LI-COR, UAB, Dartmouth) created an affibody-based probe intended
for day-of-surgery dosing (ABY-029). ABY-029 was initially designed for gliomas but applied
to H&N cancers and sarcomas. ABY-029 consists of an anti-EGFR affibody tagged to IRDye-
800cw. It was adapted to sarcomas because around 60% of sarcomas overexpress EGFR, and
higher-grade tumors tend to present higher concentrations of EGFR.37
ABY-029 synthesis began in 2013. Preclinical toxicity testing occurred between 2015 and
2016, demonstrating no toxicity at levels up to 1000× the human-equivalent microdose. ABY-
029’s no observable adverse effect limit (NOAEL) was determined to be 24.5 mg∕kg in mice,
the human equivalent is 237 mg or 3.95 mg∕kg for a 60 kg person; there was strong binding
affinity and no observed toxicity.30 In preclinical work, fluorescence was correlated strongly to
EGFR expression, with contrast peaks 4 to 8 h after administration. TBR contrast for ABY-029
was generally 3 to 4 compared with adjacent muscle or adipose tissue. When evaluated by immu-
nohistochemistry (IHC), ABY-029 correlated strongly to EGFR. However, ABY-029 binding in
necrotic regions was low. In an effort to improve whole-tumor contrast, ICG was used in a
murine xenograft model and demonstrated improved contrast in necrotic tumor regions.
One concern about use of ABY-029 in humans is the potential effects on EGFR expression by
standard neoadjuvant sarcoma therapies, usually doxorubicin-based chemotherapy and/or
external beam RT. Hence, EGFR+ and EGFR– sarcoma human xenografts were exposed to
doxorubicin chemotherapy, radiation, or both. Neither exposure appeared to have a negative

effect on EGFR expression or ABY-029 TBR, with RT associated with increased EGFR expres-
sion and increased TBR.
A phase 0/1 dose escalation trial was undertaken in humans. Patients underwent day-of-sur-
gery ABY-029 dosing and then tumor resection. Following excision, tumors were brought to
pathology, inked, and underwent bread loaf sectioning. One or two sections then underwent
low-resolution scanning to identify three areas of high signal and three areas of low fluorescence.
These areas of high and low fluorescence were then biopsied, and the resulting tissue specimens
underwent high-resolution scanning followed by slide preparation and histopathological evalu-
ation. ABY-029 fluorescence showed strong, linear correlation with the percent area of EGFR
(p < 0.0001). There were no adverse or toxic events related to ABY-029 administration.
In summary, IMI for sarcomas appears to be feasible and should be pursued in more robust
study. Based on the heterogeneity of sarcomas and their propensity for central necrosis due to
large size and rapid growth, the use of multiple fluorophores within a similar wavelength will
likely provide better whole-tumor labeling. Furthermore, the use of both long- and short-wave-
length probes would likely provide advantages for the localization of the tumor (long wave-
length) versus margin assessment (shorter wavelength).
5.3 uPAR-Targeting Dye (Fluosuide) for Surgery of Gliomas
Dr. Jane Skjøth-Rasmussen from Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark, discussed the utility
of FG001 for the intraoperative visualization of malignant gliomas. FG001 is a novel uPAR
targeting dye. uPAR is an extracellular receptor expressed on cancer cells and/or activated stro-
mal cells, allowing uPAR to serve as a biomarker of cancer. Normally, there are low levels of
uPAR expression in healthy tissue and high levels of uPAR correlate with an aggressive cancer
phenotype. FG001 is a fluorophore comprised of a uPAR-binding peptide covalently bound to
indocyanine green (ICG), allowing FG001 to bind specifically to uPAR while maintaining the
same fluorescence properties as ICG (excitation around 789 nm and emission around 814 nm).
Dr. Skjøth-Rasmussen discussed the first in-human study using FG001 in patients with
malignant gliomas. A total of 40 patients (36 of whom had high grade gliomas) were included
in this open-label nonrandomized multicenter phase 1/2 clinical trial. The primary aim of the
study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single intravenous doses of FG001 and
establish the optimal dose for imaging. The secondary objectives were to determine the
pharmacokinetic profile of FG001 and evaluate the efficacy of FG001 in patients undergoing
tumor resection. The results of the study revealed that the administration of FG001 16+ h
prior to surgery allowed for better tumor discrimination compared with the administration of
FG001 closer to surgery, with a dosage of 36 mg having the most favorable TBR. Upon his-
topathological confirmation, FG001 had a specificity of 100%, sensitivity of 79%, PPVof 100%,
and NPVof 58%. There were a total of four FG001-related adverse events in the study, three of
which were grade 1 and one of which was grade 2.38
At this time, there is an ongoing phase 2b trial that has been initiated at two Scandinavian
centers. This trial is comparing the use of FG001 against 5-ALA for influencing surgical strategy
in patients with high-grade gliomas. Future trials will also look to assess the utility of FG001 in
low-grade gliomas.
5.4 TumorGlow™ Second Window ICG in Brain Tumors
In 2016, Lee et al. reported data on the visualization of tumor tissue in the brain 24-h after the
infusion of high dose ICG (TumorGlow™).39 The mechanism is the EPR effect whereby the
disrupted tumor blood–brain barrier (BBB) allows small molecules such as ICG to accumulate
in tumor tissue and be retained due to lack of drainage. This is similar to the retention of gado-
linium contrast in tumor tissue. Dr. John Y.K. Lee, Professor of Neurosurgery and Clinical
Director for the Center for Precision Surgery at the University of Pennsylvania, explained the
technique’s unique benefits and applications. First, this SWIG guides the resection as early in the
surgery as the corticectomy. Because the NIR signal can be visualized in some cases through
the brain and dura, this allows the surgeon to choose the shortest path to the tumor. Other dyes
such as 5-ALA and previously discussed peptide-based dyes only illuminate the periphery of

the tumor. This may be due to the necrotic core of the tumor, where the tumor grew too fast for
the blood supply. With SWIG, the central necrotic core retains the ICG, creating a robust signal
of the entire tumor. This ICG signal can also be seen in areas of radiation necrosis as well.
To date, 374 cases have been done using TumorGlow™ for CNS tumors of many different
histologies. High-grade gliomas have had high signal-to-background ratio (SBR) through both
cortex (SBR ¼ 3.54) and dura (SBR ¼ 4.18) with high sensitivity (94.35%) and positive pre-
dictive value (95.12%). Furthermore, SWIG has 91% overall accuracy in predicting postoper-
ative MRI by imaging the tumor cavity at the end of resection. 40 This technique can be used for
brain metastases, intracranial meningiomas, and skull base tumors, among others. One of the
limitations is visualization of melanoma metastases (ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT03262636).

In ICG-guided surgery for pediatric renal tumors, there was a pattern in which tumors
were hypofluorescent and adjacent healthy tissue was avidly fluorescent.

inversely correlated with tumor depth (Table 5).
6.2 Tumor Paint™ Imaging: Pediatric Brain Tumors Phase Two
In pediatrics, brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer death and extent of resection remains
the single best predictor of survival and cure in this population.34 Dr. Amy Lee, the Chief of
Pediatric Neurosurgery at Seattle Children’s Hospital, discussed the investigational agent Tumor
Paint™ for maximally safe brain tumor resection. Tozuleristide, also known as BLZ-100 or
“Tumor Paint,” is a biconjugate of a derivative of chlorotoxin, a small protein that is thought

to selectively bind to targets such as calpactin and MMP-2 that are clustered in lipid rafts on the
surface of glioma cells and CG.41,42 These two components along with mannitol that is included
in the formulation allow the drug to cross the BBB to selectively bind to tumor cells. This leads
to long-lasting intracellular accumulation that can be detected in the NIR range. Tozuleristide can
be dosed the same day or the day before surgery with no change in mean fluorescence intensity,
offering the surgeon flexibility in terms of workflow.
Since its development in 2011, tozuleristide has been shown to illuminate multiple types of
cancer (e.g., basal cell carcinoma and melanoma in the skin, high-grade and low-grade tumors of
various types in the brain, and early-stage and invasive cancers in the breast) in phase 1 and phase
2 trials that have enrolled over 220 patients.43–45 For central nervous system tumors, these trials
have demonstrated that tozuleristide is useful in adult and pediatric tumors with specificity for
both high-grade and low-grade gliomas, can be useful in primary and reresection, has a short
serum half-life which minimized background signal, demonstrates intracellular accumulation
that lasted for longer surgeries (i.e., >10 h), and can be visible beyond overlying tissue
due to NIR fluorescence that has better depth penetration. Because tozuleristide uses doses
of ICG in the nanomolar range, as opposed to millimolar range used in vascular angiography,
specialized detection devices such as the Canvas imaging system with increased sensitivity are
required.
At the end of 2018, Dr. Lee and colleagues at nine institutions around the United States began
a pivotal phase 2/3 trial that included 123 pediatric patients who were randomized 1:10 to two
arms. One received tozuleristide at a dose of 15 mg∕m2 1 to 36 h before surgery (n ¼ 112) and
one received standard of care neurosurgery with no drug treatment (n ¼ 11). The study design
focused on analysis of “equivocal tissue,” that is, normal tissue surrounding the tissue such as
retraction artifact or gliosis that should be preserved. This is a particularly important analysis for
the use of tumor paint in pediatrics as 85% of pediatric tumors present in the posterior fossa
where it is highly valuable to visualize definitive margins. Enrollment for this trial has been
completed including 63% males, diversity of race, and proportionate representation of four main
pediatric CNS tumor types. There have been no drug-related serious adverse effects to date.
Looking to the future, Dr. Lee shared updates regarding the blinded central fluorescence assess-
ment required to complete the trial as well as device upgrades for technical modifications to the
camera system (ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT02462629).
6.3 Clinical Experience Using ICG
Dr. Abdelhafeez H. Abdelhafeez from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital presented on the
use of ICG for pediatric tumor resection. Although adult clinical studies have indicated that ICG
can improve tumor localization and resection, it is still unclear if it can be similarly applied to
pediatric cancers. Dr. Abdelhafeez has conducted a retrospective study with St. Jude data from
2019 to 2020 to determine the feasibility of ICG-guided tumor resection in a broad range of
childhood cancers including neuroblastoma, sarcomas, hepatic tumors, pulmonary metastases,
and other rare pediatric tumors.46 A 1.5-mg∕kg infusion of ICG 24 h prior to surgery is sufficient
for detecting both primary tumors and metastatic deposits, indicating that the optimal dose for
pediatric patients is much lower than the 3 to 5 mg∕kg ICG typically used in adult clinical trials.
In 65 procedures, there were four cases in which ICG localized tumors that were not identified by
standard of care visualization and palpation (Table 6). Although NIR localization was successful
in eight patients who underwent ICG-guided nephron-sparing surgery for pediatric renal tumors,
Dr. Abdelhafeez’s team observed a pattern in which tumors were hypofluorescent and adjacent
healthy kidney tissue was avidly fluorescent.47 Further work must be conducted to explore the
feasibility of ICG-guided pediatric tumor resection, but these preliminary findings suggest that
SWIG sensitivity and specificity differ depending on tumor histology and location (Tables 7
and 8).
ICG infusion may be used for lymph node sampling and staging of pediatric tumor. In eight
patients with Wilms tumor, ICG was administered locally by IP injection for laparoscopic
nephrectomy and by peri-hilar (PH) injection for open nephrectomy.49 Since the benefits of fluo-
rescence-guided lymphatic mapping is still unclear, Dr. Abdelhafeez’s group will soon launch a
prospective trial for ICG-guided SLN mapping during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.

His team is currently involved in an ongoing prospective trial to explore the use of ICG for
identifying neoplastic disease during pediatric tumor resection. They are assessing for ICG
uptake, the effect of chemotherapy and RT on fluorescence, localization, synchronous lesions,
and positive margins.
6.4 Preclinical Experience on Target Agents for Pediatric Solid Tumors
Dr. Marcus M. Malek from the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh discussed radiolabeled and
fluorescently labeled anti-GD2 probes. As radiological instruments continue to improve, sur-
geons are tasked with removing smaller microdeposits of disease. Dr. Malek’s team has
developed a tracer that targets GD2, a highly expressed antigen in common childhood cancers
including high-risk neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma.50,51
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial pediatric solid tumor. There are ∼700 to 800
new diagnoses each year in the United States, 70% of which have metastatic disease.52 Gross
total resection is the surgical goal, but complications and inadequate surgery rate can be as high
as 30% to 50%. IMI may reduce this rate by facilitating the detection of synchronous lesions,
margin evaluation, and localization, which can limit the damage inflicted on vital neurovascular
structures that are frequently encased by this tumor. Dr. Malek’s group is currently evaluating the
use of dinutuximab (an FDA-approved anti-GD2 antibody) radiolabeled with indium-111 and

conjugated to IRDye800CW for NIR surgical navigation. Their highly specific antibody-based
tracer relies on gamma detection for improved localization and NIR fluorescence for lesion
confirmation and margin evaluation.53
Dr. Malek’s group has tested the tracer on an orthotopic model of neuroblastoma in athymic,
nude mice. 96 h after tail vein injection of 111In-DTPA-diutuximab-IRDye800CW, mouse
gamma biodistribution was performed. Tracer specificity was validated by increased uptake
in tumors and reduced uptake in antibody blocking groups. Mice were further assessed with
intraoperative systems including gamma detection probe (Mammotome, Cincinnati, Ohio) and
with an NIR camera (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan) both of which detected robust and
tumor-specific tracer uptake. A processed tissue model was also utilized to assess the effect
of tumor depth on signal detection. While fluorescent signal was significantly limited by depth
within tissue, gamma signal could be detected from as deep as 5 cm within tissue. The next steps
will be to optimize the time from injection to surgery, tracer dose, and molar activity of 111In.
In the near future, Dr. Malek will test signal detection limitations in tumors embedded in porcine
organs as well as gelatin phantoms with autofluorescing or photon-absorbing background
agents, and other GD2-positive tumors, such as melanoma, Ewing sarcoma, gliomas, and
osteosarcoma.

and has no biological effect upon binding. Dr. Ryan K. Orosco, MD, associate professor of
otolaryngology at the University of New Mexico, described the first-in-human clinical trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT04420689) of ALM-488 (Bevonescein) for intraoperative fluores-
cence nerve visualization.54
The objectives of this trial included understanding the safety of IV administration of this
agent, characterizing the pharmacokinetics, dose, and timing, and appreciating the surgical
impact of ALM-488 in terms of contrast enhancement, nerve length measurements, and branch-
ing delineation. Cases of neck dissection, parotidectomy, and thyroidectomy were included. The
first component of the study involved a dose escalation schema starting at 100 mg of agent to
1000 mg of agent infused over 30 min assuming no dose limiting toxicities or adverse events.
Once a safe dose with acceptable fluorescence was established, the second component of the
study investigated the optimal dose timing schedule, that is, either 1 to 3 h or 2 to 5 h before
surgery.
Twenty-seven patients were recruited between three sites with no serious adverse events
related to the drug recorded. Surgeries were conducted per standard of care, with intermittent
pausing to capture fluorescence images with the Zeiss Tivato camera system (Carl Zeiss Meditec
AG, Jena, Germany). Urine and serum were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis, demonstrat-
ing a serum half-life of 30 min. Notably, the surgeons were able to observe fluorescence contrast
up to 6 to 7 h after infusion at a dose of 500 mg. A quantitative analysis of SBR assessed by
an independent core lab determined that 84% of paired nerve images at 500 mg dosage dem-
onstrated higher contrast with bevonescein as compared to white light. In addition, 38% of
nerves demonstrated an increased length of visualization using this agent. Avisualization scoring
system was provided to surgeons to quantify their evaluation of the contrast enhancement, length
measurement, and branching delineation using the dye, which found a statistically significant
improvement in each of these qualities. With these results, Dr. Orosco and his colleagues at four
additional institutions are organizing a phase 3 trial with a target accrual of 200 patients.
7.3 Near-Infrared Nerve-Specific Probes for Intraoperative Nerve
Visualization
Dr. Summer L. Gibbs from the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health and Science University
presented the use of NIR contrast agents for nerve imaging. Iatrogenic nerve damage is an
important challenge with many surgical procedures. For example, head and neck surgeons often
operate in close proximity to the facial nerve and vagus nerves. Similarly, nerve-sparing pros-
tatectomy is dependent on identification of the neurovascular bundle. Specific nerve highlighting
could potentially allow for better identification and visualization of nerves intraoperatively and
reduce the chance of iatrogenic injury. One major consideration for nerve imaging is ensuring
that the agent is nerve specific, to reduce the amount of imaging signal from fat, connective
tissue, and glandular tissue. Oxazine 4 has been a promising nerve-specific fluorophore, but
its emission wavelength falls in the red-light spectrum. Dr. Gibbs’ group has been working
to chemically modify oxazine 4 to maintain its nerve specificity while shifting its emission into
the NIR (650 to 900 nm) spectrum for surgical application. By adjusting the conjugation of
agents such as oxazines 1 and 4, Dr. Gibbs’ group has been able to create nerve-specific fluo-
rophores that emit closer to 700 and 800 nm, which allow these agents to remain compatible with
current clinical fluorescence imaging systems.55
Currently, Dr. Gibbs’ group is moving one of their lead 700-nm nerve probes, LGW16-03,
toward clinical translation. The group has studied LGW16-03 extensively in rats and mice, and
the probe has shown a promising SBR when highlighting human nerves in patients who have
undergone lower limb amputations in collaboration with Dr. Eric Henderson. LGW16-03 can
also be potentially used with two-color fluorescence-guided surgery, to better identify and spare
nerves that are near tumor tissue. In the CNS, the group has been able to visualize cranial nerves
and white matter tracts using their NIR nerve imaging agents. They have also been able to per-
form functional fluorescence imaging to examine nerve health and assess the extent of prior
nerve injury or detect iatrogenic nerve injury. The preclinical pharmacology and toxicology
studies have been performed for LGW16-03, and the group is currently moving toward IND-
enabling studies and clinical translation in collaboration with Dr. Eric Henderson at Dartmouth.

7.4 Ureter Dyes During Urologic Cancer Surgery: Normal Tissue
Identification
Dr. Richard W. Farnam from Las Palmas Del Sol Healthcare presented a phase 2 multicenter
study on the applications of IMI for urologic cancer. Minimally invasive procedures such as a
laparoscopic hysterectomy are used to treat urologic disease but are associated with ureteral
injury, particularly at the pelvic brim (PB) and cardinal ligament.48 IMI allowed for more distinct
localization and depth perception, which can help prevent ureteral injury. Because ICG is hepati-
cally metabolized, it cannot be used for intraoperative ureter visualization. Dr. Farnam’s group
has developed IS-001, a cyanine ureter probe that is intravenously administered via a slow-bolus
injection and is renally excreted. Its excitation (peak ∼ 780 nm) and emission (peak ∼ 815 nm)
are similar to ICG, making it compatible with the clinically available Intuitive daVinci Robotic
System and Firefly imaging mode.
After confirmation of clinical safety in the phase 1 data, the study moved to phase 2 and
enrolled 94 subjects to SBR and efficacy.56 Dr. Farnam’s team has determined that signal can
be detected through 0.5 to 1 cm of tissue and that the optimal imaging window is 30 to 45 min
after infusion of 22 mg IS-001. SBRs were >2.0 at both the PB and uterine arteries (UA), indi-
cating enhanced ureter visualization. Intraoperative assessment by the surgeon also suggested that
NIR imaging significantly improved localization compared with white light. Ureter identification
and delineation efficacies were assessed by 10 independent, blinded readers who were tasked with
labeling the ureter on ∼300 randomized images in four different conditions: anatomical location
(PB or UA), time-point, white light, or Firefly imaging, and presence or absence of ureter in the
surgical field of view. At both anatomical locations, readers had superior identification and delin-
eation in NIR Firefly images. By 60 min postinfusion, the fluorescent signal had attenuated. There
were no clinically relevant adverse events. These results are promising, and a phase 3 multicenter
study is in the pipeline to further evaluate the use of IS-001 in urologic cancer resection.
8 Bench to Bedside Tips
8.1 Choline Kinase Dyes
Dr. Edward J. (Jim) Delikatny, PhD, professor of radiology at the University of Pennsylvania
reports recent developments of a choline kinase-targeted NIR dye for the imaging of lung can-
cers. Choline kinase is an enzyme that is critical in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine
which makes up roughly 50% of cell membranes. It is upregulated in 59% of nonsmall-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC).57
Choline kinases inhibitors typically include bisymmetric aromatic rings containing a posi-
tively charged nitrogen group connected by a linker moiety. Delikatny’s group therefore used a
similarly structured bis-indolium dye which is the backbone of cyanine dyes to synthesize a NIR
dye JAS239 that would competitively inhibit choline kinase.58,59 This dye was validated in
a panel of human breast cancer cell lines as well as mice bearing orthotopic MCF7 breast
xenografts. At this point, Dr. Delikatny collaborated with thoracic surgery colleagues to target
NSCLC which is the leading cause of lung cancers and has up to 40% recurrence at the primary
site after surgical resection. To begin the translation from dye candidate to viable diagnostic tool,
his group screened murine NSCLC cell lines for elevated choline kinase expression, identifying
the KLN205 tumor line as a strong model. It metastasizes from a flank tumor to the lungs in
roughly 20 days. Thereafter, they dosed JAS239 in this orthotopic murine model to confirm via
biochemical and histologic analysis that JAS239 was nontoxic in mice.58
Clinical trials using companion dogs were initiated as companion canine models provide
similar environmental conditions, cancer development, and optimal imaging techniques to
humans. These dogs would receive JAS239 4 to 24 h before surgery during which the wound
bed was examined for tumor margins, lymph nodes, and micrometastases and back-table analy-
sis was then correlated with histology and IHC. Target validation was first completed in five
canines with lung adenocarcinomas to confirm the increased choline kinase expression in the
lung tumor as compared with benign lung. Toxicology studies were then completed in canines to
ensure that JAS239 was nontoxic in normal canines. Therefore, the clinical trial was completed
Bou-Samra et al.: Intraoperative molecular imaging: 3rd biennial clinical trials update

May 2023 • Vol. 28(5)
with 12 canines of mixed breed, age, weight, tumor size and location, and sex at various doses of
JAS239 ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg∕kg. Analyzing canine imaging by dose reveals the optimal
TBR of 6 at 0.5 mg∕kg, which is confirmed by back table imaging. Finally, recent data confirm
the utility of JAS239 in delineating tumor from necrotic regions, detecting surgical margins, and
identifying lymph node involvement. Moving forward, Dr. Delikatny’s group plans to complete
the canine clinical trial (n ¼ 30) to further optimize dose and timing as well as technical com-
ponents, before translating to human clinical trials.
8.2 pH-Sensitive Dyes: Baran Sumer, MD
Biomarker expression on tumor cells can be variable and may not be universal within even a
single cancer type. As such, developing a universal imaging probe with high specificity and
sensitivity presents unique challenges for cancer imaging. To do so, Dr. Baran Sumer, MD,
Chief of Head and Neck Oncology at UT Southwestern Medical Center, in conjunction with
Jinming Gai, PhD, professor of pharmacology, have developed an imaging drug that targets the
uniquely acidic tumor microenvironment as the tumor pH has been found to be roughly 6.8 or
lower across a wide range of tumor types, as compared with blood pH of 7.4.60 This drug has
been previously described and is known as pegsitacianine.
Initial phase 1 and phase 2 trials were completed in Europe whereby a pH-nanoprobe was
given to 17 patients intravenously 24 h before surgery at a dose of 1 mg∕kg. It was able to detect
fluorescence in a variety of different cancers including head and neck cancers with an estimated
PPVof roughly 70%.33 This led to a phase 2 head and neck cancer clinical trial completed at the
University of Pennsylvania in 14 patients, which demonstrated 0/14 positive margins, which is
lower than previously reported values around 10%, indicating clear demarcation (i.e., no over-
lap) as well as a PPVof 83%, sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 86%. To improve the speci-
ficity and minimize the background signal, Dr. Sumer’s group determined that using a polymer
micelle that would degrade at a lower pH, perhaps as low as 5.3, would be a suitable solution.61,62
This led to the phase 2 clinical trial now organized to identify unknown primary cancers of the
head and neck using now-improved pH-nanoprobe pegsitacianine. These tumors are uniquely
posed to benefit from fluorescence-guided resection as many of these patients have large por-
tions of their larynx and pharynx irradiated with high doses in treatment, leading to dysphagia.
The phase 2 design is a nonrandomized, open-label, single-center safety, and imaging feasibility
study of pegsitacianine. The standard primary endpoints are sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and
proportion of patients with an occult disease detected or a positive margin missed by standard
of care. Exploratory endpoints include TBR, number of previously unidentified margins
detected, and reresection rate, among others.
8.3 NIH Perspective of Clinical Trials in Intraoperative Molecular Imaging
Dr. Lalitha K. Shankar from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) explained the different NCI
funding opportunities for optical imaging clinical trials. The NCI Division of Cancer
Treatment and Diagnosis supports phase 1 and early phase 2 trials through its Experimental
Therapeutic Clinical Trial Network (ETCTN) and phase 2 and 3 trials through its National
Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). Table 10 lists funding opportunities available. Dr. Shankar
also introduced the NCI Experimental Therapeutics Program (NExT), which is a competitive
contract program that provides access to NCI discovery and development resources for
high-risk preliminary projects.
9 Alternative Imaging Strategies
9.1 Summary of Main Points
• Fluorescence lifetime imaging
•
Fluoresce lifetime is the decay map of a molecule that is excited by a laser pulse and
can then be built by graphing the exponential decay against time.

May 2023 • Vol. 28(5)
•
The lifetime of the tumor is distinct from normal tissue with a statistically significant
lifetime separation.
• Label-free fluorescence lifetime imaging
•
Label-free fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) leverages the autofluorescence
properties of structural proteins, metabolic cofactors (e.g., NADH, FAD), lipids, lip-
oproteins, and other molecular complexes to identify tumor tissue without the admin-
istration of exogenous contrast agents.
•
FLIM can provide optical contrast between areas of high and low tumor density and
help identify several tumor subtypes.
• Photoacoustic imaging
•
The photoacoustic effect takes advantage of the nonradiative relaxation of photons,
releasing energy as heat that can be transferred to sound waves by thermal expansion.
•
Sound has the advantage of experiencing much weaker scattering in biological tissue
when compared with traditional fluorescence photons, making it suitable for high-
resolution imaging in deep tissue.
• Multispectral camera imaging
•
Current NIR imaging instruments employ one to two fluorescent channels and are
dye specific.
•
A multispectral camera uses vertically stacked photodetectors at various depths to
detect different emission wavelengths and can differentiate fluorophores within the
700 nm and within the 800 nm wavelengths.
9.2 Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging with Dyes
Dr. Kumar from Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School introduced a different
method to quantify fluorescence than fluorescence intensity. He explained that fluorescence
intensity has proven to be fast, portable, and easy to use.63 However, there are some disadvan-
tages: it cannot always separate tumor from background, it depends on the imaging system being
used. It can be affected by external ambient light and has a difficulty of multiplexing (detecting
different dyes at the same time).

While the fluorescence spectrum is widely utilized, fluorescence lifetime is another area of
quantifying contrast. It is influenced by the average time a molecule spends in an excited state
(nanoseconds for infrared light). Once a molecule is excited by a laser pulse, a decay map can
then be built by graphing the exponential decay against time (in seconds). Each pixel is fit for
its corresponding exponential decay value over time to generate a lifetime map.
The advantage of this is that unlike MFI, which is unitless, this can be measured in nano-
seconds. It has also been shown to be more sensitive than MFI and usable in the setting of
multiple dyes (multiplexed imaging).64,65
Dr. Kumar’s early work was mainly focused on tomographic applications of lifetime in ani-
mals with applications including cardiac imaging with activatable dyes. In early 2016, injecting
ICG in a mouse and imaging a day later showed that the lifetime of the tumor was distinct from
normal tissue with a statistically significant lifetime separation. In comparing ICG fluorescence
intensity to lifetime, lifetime had a superior ability to discern SBR compared with using fluo-
rescence alone.66
Upon examining EGFR-targeted probes in preclinical models, the same phenomenon was
observed. Lifetime was enhanced in tumors with a superior performance accuracy in comparison
to intensity.60 Traditional measurement of fluoresce intensity of these specimens showed that
fluorescence was detected outside the tumor margins. However, the lifetime map was more
restricted to the tumor and had less background.67 Upon microscopic evaluation, there was
a strong correlation between EGFR expression seen on IHC and the lifetime of anti-EGFR-
conjugated IRDye800CW. To further corroborate the localization and discerning capacity of
lifetime, Dr. Kumar presented a liver cancer specimen from a cancer resection done by
Dr. Kenneth Tabe at MGH. The tumor stained with ICG shows peripheral enhancement and
no fluorescence within the tumor. A comparative evaluation using lifetime showed that the entire
tumor actually fluoresced, especially areas that did not fluoresce on ICG alone. Dr. Kumar also
showed examples from various types of cancer tissues and showed that the mean lifetime was
significantly longer. This could allow for a fluorescence lifetime threshold that can be applied
across multiple tumor types.
Dr. Kumar showed the application of this technology can be expanded to lymph node evalu-
ation and multiplexing. In oral cancer surgery performed by Dr. Allen Feng at Massachusetts Eye
and Ear, lymph nodes were examined using tumor lifetime. The negative lymph node had shorter
lifetimes and correlated well with histology. In brain tumor imaging of specimens sent from
Dr. John Lee at the University of Pennsylvania, tumor lifetime not only allowed detection of
tumor cells but also discerning blood vessels, part of its multiplexing capacity.
Dr. Kumar then explained that while work is still progressing in understanding the mech-
anisms behind lifetime increase in solid tumors, a tentative explanation for why lifetime differ-
entiates malignant from benign cells has to do with dye endocytosis and higher lysosomal
viscosity of cancer cells.
9.3 Label-Free Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging
Dr. Laura Marcu PhD, professor of biomedical engineering and neurological surgery at
University of California–Davis described label-free optical technologies in the surgical work-
flow. Label-free FLIM leverages the autofluorescence properties of structural proteins, metabolic
cofactors (e.g., NADH, FAD), lipids, lipoproteins, and other molecular complexes to identify
tumor tissue without the administration of exogenous contrast agents.68 The major challenges
preventing the application of FLIM in the operating room involve the complex and expensive
instruments with long data acquisition times required for FLIM. As such, Dr. Marcu has devel-
oped practical point-scanning FLIM devices such as the pulse-sampling multispectral FLIM
instrumentation. It records fluorescence decay using a tandem of four separate spectral channels
that were tailored to molecular components in the tissue.69 When digitized, this compact appa-
ratus allows for fast, accurate, and precise multispectral FLIM measurements. Importantly, this
approach enables FLIM measurements under standard room-light illumination and allows the
surgeon to easily navigate the complex geometry of resection cavities. This device is used in
conjunction with a surgical microscope/endoscope and robotic platform to provide a real-time
augmented FLIM image on the surgical field-of-view.

In addition, her group has developed FLIM fiber probes for different clinical applications,
such as robotic surgery, brain biopsy guidance, transoral surgery, and neurosurgery. In transoral
surgery, they are able to correlate FLIM data with histopathology results to develop classifiers
based on fluorescence parameters that could directly augment tumor probability predictions.70
Furthermore, this technique was useful to correctly detect primary lesion in patients with
p16+ head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of the unknown primary and demarcate entire
benign tissue from oropharyngeal carcinoma.71 In neurosurgery, Alfonso-Garcia et al. demon-
strated safe and real-time intraoperative FLIM acquisition which was correlated to histology and
MRI to resolve distinct brain tissue types that were clinically relevant.72 Dr. Marcu also reported
leverage of this technology to distinguish oligodendroglioma from astrocytoma indicating that
label-free FLIM could be a biomarker for low-grade IDH-mutant tumors.73 Preliminary results
suggested that FLIM data can provide optical contrast between areas of high and low tumor
density thereby detecting the infiltrative edge of GBM in real-time. Dr. Marcu also describes
quantitative assessment of PpiX fluorescence at room light using FLIM as an augmented visu-
alization tool for real-time resection under standard surgical field illumination.74
9.4 Photoacoustic Imaging
Dr. Lei Li from Rice University presented the clinical applications of advances in photoacoustic
imaging. Optical imaging allows for the characterization of the functional, metabolic, anatomi-
cal, histological, and molecular properties of tissue. Photoacoustic tomography has the advan-
tage of imaging in-vivo organs up to 4 cm deep. The photoacoustic effect takes advantage of the
nonradioactive relaxation of photons, releasing energy as heat that can be transferred to sound
waves by thermal expansion.75 Sound has the advantage of experiencing much weaker scattering
in biological tissue when compared with traditional fluorescence photons, making it suitable for
high-resolution imaging in deep tissue. Taking advantage of this light-matter interaction, photo-
acoustic imaging has been able to use various endogenous chromophores and exogenous con-
trast agents, such as hemoglobin, melanin, lipids, DNA/RNA, organic dyes, nanoparticles, and
fluorescence proteins. Another advantage of photoacoustic imaging is that its spatial resolution
and penetration depths are scalable with the detection frequency. Photoacoustic CT works by
shining a laser light onto a tissue, which raises the temperature of the tissue a bit and leads to
volume expansion, generating acoustic waves. Acoustic sensors can then generate high-resolu-
tion images mapping the optical absorption inside deep tissue.
Dr. Li talked about whole-body photoacoustic CT at high spatiotemporal resolutions and its
applications in rodents and humans.76 Using single-impulse panoramic photoacoustic CT, a res-
olution of 100 μm across the whole body of an animal can be reached with a data acquisition
time of 50 μs at a framerate of 50 Hz. Photoacoustic can allow for real-time imaging of the
abdomen, liver, and brain of rodents. It can also perform in vivo functional imaging of the whole
brain of rats, allowing them to map out the functional connectivity of the brain and image the
detailed vessel networks within the brain via optical imaging techniques. Photoacoustic have
also been applied to image melanoma cells in small animal models, using endogenous melanin
as the contrast agent (absorption near 690 nm).4 Dr. Li’s team has started moving toward clinical
translation by creating a panoramic photoacoustic CT imaging system for human breast tumor
diagnosis and assessing blood vessel density. Functional photoacoustic imaging can also be
applied to the human brain. It has a higher temporal resolution when compared with MRI and
provides a potentially cheaper alternative to magnetic field-based imaging.
9.5 Multispectral Camera Imaging
Dr. Victor Gruev from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign discussed the applications
of bioinspired imaging devices for NIR surgical navigation. Current NIR imaging instruments
employ one to two fluorescent channels and are dye specific. However, it can be costly and
inefficient to purchase a new imaging device for each tracer. This also limits the simultaneous
use of multiple fluorophores intraoperatively, which is an approach that may improve sensitivity
and specificity compared with a single tracer infusion. To resolve this issue, Dr. Gruev’s team is
developing a camera inspired by the mantis shrimp’s optical system. The imaging device uses

vertically stacked photodetectors at various depths to detect different emission wavelengths.77
It is highly specific and can differentiate fluorophores within the 700 nm and within the
800 nm wavelengths. Furthermore, it is sensitive to small spectral changes and can distinguish
between ICG diluted in water and ICG diluted in serum, which are only spectrally separated
by 8 nm.
Dual-tracer strategies have shown promising results for improved sensitivity and specificity.
Dr. Gruev’s group has tested this approach in a murine model of human prostate cancer. EGF
conjugated to IRDye680RD and 2-DG conjugated to IRDye800CW were intravenously admin-
istered. After 24 h, each tracer fluorescently labeled tumor tissue that would have otherwise gone
undetected by the other probe, suggesting that combination tracers have a complementary effect.
The imaging system is also able to distinguish multiple fluorophores in human patients.
Dr. Gruev’s clinical study has shown that local administration of methylene blue and ICG assists
with SLN mapping in 25 patients with breast cancer. Future studies will further evaluate the
benefits of multiple fluorophores for in vivo surgical navigation.
Another limitation to current imaging technology is the endoscope itself. Because NIR
fluorescence and color in the visible light spectrum are focused at different points, imaging
both views simultaneously with a standard endoscope requires multiple cameras and reduces
resolution.78 Dr. Gruev’s team has developed a single-camera NIR endoscope that successfully
focuses NIR and color images at the same plane. The endoscope is compatible with their bio-
inspired single-camera system, which improves resolution compared with standard endoscopes
(Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) and eliminates the need for multiple NIR cameras.
The multispectral imaging system has demonstrated the potential to differentiate tracers
within the 600- to 800-nm emission peak range and determine the exact ratio of multiple fluo-
rophores within fluorescent tissue. Currently, Dr. Gruev’s group is testing an ultrasensitive NIR
imaging sensor (<1 ms integration time) in an ongoing clinical trial for a cathepsin-activated NIR
tracer (VGT-309) in pulmonary cancer. The goal of this camera is to capture weak fluorescence
observed in small metastases and deep tumors that may be undetected by other conventional
imaging devices.
9.6 Unmet Needs
There are various applications of IMI: identifying margins, identifying synchronous lesions,
localizing occult cancers, identifying normal structures, performing complete cytoreductive sur-
gery, and even identifying select positive lymph nodes. However, there remains some scientific
challenges and unmet needs.
To begin, Dr. Singhal explained that background noise remains a common problem. Part of
the reason is secondary to autofluorescence and background binding. The second is lymph node
imaging. Although there has been some discussion about it in head and neck surgery, it remains
an unmet challenge. SLNs are widely used but carry a heavy burden such as lymphedema.
Up to 10% of patients developing upper extremity lymphedema even with SLD biopsies.79
Furthermore, micrometastases imaging is an area that we have not been able to address fully
yet. The tracers are available but the cameras we currently have might not be sensitive enough to
detect micrometastases. The challenge is to maintain our clinically useful field of view in the OR
with adequate resolution to identify micrometastatic disease. Its importance is twofold. On the
one hand, knowing that there is remaining microscopic metastasis can help guide the need for
postoperative chemotherapy or other treatments. Also, leaving cells behind in a pool of blood or
fluid that have no ability to adhere to the resection bed and proliferate is different from leaving
tumor cells with the ability to multiply and cause a recurrence.
Another issue is depth of penetration. NIR allows for better depth penetration than visible
wavelengths, but NIRII imaging is another unmet need. This second NIR window (1000 to
1700 nm) has maximum permission exposure and penetration depth over NIR-I phototherapy
)
650 to 950 nm) but has not been fully used in IMI at this time.80 On another note, current
applications have not addressed renal cell, bladder, pancreatic, and endometrial cancer, all of
which could benefit from this technology. Finally, endoscopic approaches remain a challenge.
There are no commonly available flexible endoscopic approaches that utilize fluorescent
imaging.

The future is phase 4 trials and that entails several steps from a regulatory standpoint. The
FDA requirements for IMI will fall under diagnostic requirement. These are going to be more
strict than therapeutic as these tests are diagnostic. Another area worth further investigation is
adoption of these companies by hospital systems. We currently have a wide range of dyes and
multiple cameras that can detect multiple dyes. Will hospitals buy additional cameras or favor
using dyes that work on already existing cameras that they have? Another is addressing reim-
bursement. There are no reimbursement strategies currently in place for IMI. In light of that,
there is value in identifying who would benefit most from IMI. Ideally, a predictive tool to iden-
tify who would benefit from undergoing IMI would be helpful in guiding patient selection.
Another important tool in encouraging adoption and proper utilization of IMI technologies is
education particularly after a drug undergoes a successful phase 3 clinical trial. Although a lot of the
technicalities of using this technology are rather straightforward, there is an element of learning
how to discern false positives and interpreting images. In other words, how would surgeons become
adept at discerning TBR ratios adequately intraoperatively. The consensus was organizing courses
afterward to disseminate educational material. From the surgeons’ experience, maintaining engag-
ing educational activities as opposed to mere distribution of educational materials (flyers or videos)
yields better results in disseminating information and ensuring safe and proper adoption of the
technology. Dr. Singhal concluded with an optimistic statement that the negative predictive value
of this technology is very impressive. He explained that if after the conclusion of surgery there is
remaining fluorescence, it could either be a false positive or a true positive. Meanwhile, if after
cancer surgery no fluorescence is detected, then it is likely a true negative and this is reassuring.
