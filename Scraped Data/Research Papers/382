ABSTRACT
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on response demonstrations combined with Re-
inforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) constitutes a powerful
paradigm for aligning LLM-based AI agents. However, a significant limitation
of such an approach is its dependency on high-quality human annotations, making
its application to intricate tasks challenging due to difficulties in obtaining consis-
tent response demonstrations and in-distribution response preferences. This paper
presents a novel approach, namely SALMON (Self-ALignMent with principle-
fOllowiNg reward models), to align base language models with minimal human
supervision, using only a small set of human-defined principles, yet achieving
superior performance. Central to our approach is a principle-following reward
model.
Trained on synthetic preference data, this model can generate reward
scores based on arbitrary human-defined principles. By merely adjusting these
principles during the RL training phase, we gain full control over the prefer-
ences with the reward model, subsequently influencing the behavior of the RL-
trained policies, and eliminating the reliance on the collection of online human
preferences. Applying our method to the LLaMA-2-70b base language model,
we developed an AI assistant named Dromedary-2. With only 6 exemplars
for in-context learning and 31 human-defined principles, Dromedary-2 signifi-
cantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems, including
LLaMA-2-Chat-70b, on various benchmark datasets. We have open-sourced
the code and model weights to encourage further research into aligning LLM-
based AI agents with enhanced supervision efficiency, improved controllability,
and scalable oversight.

INTRODUCTION
The prevailing AI alignment paradigm, exemplified in models like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) and
LLaMA-2-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023b), employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with prompted
demonstrations (Sanh et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2022a; Zhou et al., 2023) and reinforcement learn-
ing from human feedback (RLHF) to align the outputs of large language models (LLMs) with human
intentions (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022). However, acquiring high-quality human anno-
tations, including consistent response demonstrations and in-distribution preferences, is costly and
not scalable (Touvron et al., 2023b). Furthermore, the existing paradigm of SFT + RLHF is inher-
ently limited in assuming that humans can always demonstrate or evaluate the tasks undertaken by
advanced AI systems. Although today’s models fall within human evaluative boundaries, future,
more advanced models could embark on tasks that challenge human evaluation. Consequently, there

Self-Align & SALMON
is a looming danger, i.e., such models may value appeasing human evaluators over ensuring accuracy
(Andreas, 2022; Perez et al., 2022).
To address the current challenges in AI alignment, we aim to develop a new methodology that fa-
cilitates scalable oversight (Amodei et al., 2016; Bowman et al., 2022). Our vision is to define a
few general principles, akin to Issac Asimov’s three laws in robotics (Asimov, 1941), which are
comprehensively interalizable for AI systems to follow (Gilardi et al., 2023; Ganguli et al., 2023).
This goal is in line with the recent research on self-alignment (Bai et al., 2022b; Sun et al., 2023b),
where the primary focus is to use AI models to improve themselves, e.g., with bootstrapping over
the model-generated critiques (Madaan et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023) or self-refined outputs (Wang
et al., 2022a; Li et al., 2023a). However, it is worth noting that these bootstrapping methods still
lag behind the RLHF method in performance (Bai et al., 2022b; Touvron et al., 2023b). Meanwhile,
methods like Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) or Constitutional AI (CAI) (Bai
et al., 2022b; OpenAI, 2023a) has emerged as an alternative potential. These techniques leverage
feedback from automated AI systems, reducing the reliance on exhaustive human-annotated prefer-
ences. So far, the primary focus of the previous RLAIF work remains on enhancing the safety of
the models that have already undergone RLHF training. That is, these RLAIF methods inherit the
heavy dependency on the human-annotated preferences in the RLHF warm-up stage. This leads to
a pivotal research question:
• Can RLAIF fully replace RLHF to align language models from scratch in enhancing their
general alignment and capabilities?
This paper provides a definitive confirmation for the above question by introducing a novel approach
namely SALMON. At the heart of our approach lies the introduction of the principle-following
(also termed instruction-following) reward model. Pioneering in its nature, this reward model is
adept at interpreting and adhering to arbitrary human-written preference guidelines, subsequently
generating human-guided reward scores. This is different from previous RLAIF methods (Bai et al.,
2022b; OpenAI, 2023a) where the principles are only used to produce synthetic preferences, and the
resulting reward models generate scores without any specific principles, as illustrated in Figure 1.
The design of our principle-following reward model enables better control over the behavior of
the final RL-trained policy model. Within conventional RLHF paradigms, the iterative collection
of online (in-distribution) preference data (Bai et al., 2022a; Touvron et al., 2023b) is essential to
counteract reward hacking (Pan et al., 2022). This complication emerges when the policy model
exploits weaknesses in the reward model, producing inflated scores that do not accurately reflect
model performance. In SALMON, we can address this issue by simply crafting principles explicitly

designed to combat observed1 reward hacking patterns in model outputs, such as self-praising at the
end of the response. Additionally, we found that we are able to emphasize distinct aspects of the
alignment in the HHH (helpful, honest, and harmless) alignment framework (Askell et al., 2021)
by customizing the preference principles. Our methodology also proved effective in reducing the
occurrence of false refusals seen in certain over-aligned language models (Touvron et al., 2023b) by
crafting special principles.
Our principle-following reward model can be trained with synthetic data and seamlessly applied to
a diverse range of language models without collecting any model-specific human preference data
(Bai et al., 2022a; Touvron et al., 2023b). Possible policy model initialization strategies include
principle-driven self-alignment (Sun et al., 2023b), supervised fine-tuning on human demonstrations
(Chung et al., 2022a; Zhou et al., 2023), or even those unaligned base language models (Touvron
et al., 2023a). Remarkably, when integrated with the SELF-ALIGN technique (Sun et al., 2023b),
our method enabled the training of a self-aligned AI-assistant agent, namely Dromedary-2, from
scratch by only manually crafting 6 exemplars for In-Context Learning (Brown et al., 2020) and a
combined total of 31 principles (17 from SELF-ALIGN and 14 for SALMON). Despite its mini-
mal human supervision design, our model outperformed the extensively RLHF-trained LLaMA-2-
Chat model (Touvron et al., 2023b), which was trained with over 20,000+ human-curated response
demonstrations and 1,000,000+ human-annotated response preferences. The comparisons of human
supervision efficiency and performance on MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) are detailed in Table. 1.

guage models (LLMs), to human values and intentions in terms of being helpful, honest, and harm-
less (Christiano et al., 2017; Patil et al., 2020; Askell et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al.,

vanced in their capabilities (Devlin et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery
et al., 2022). This work focuses on the problem of aligning LLMs from scratch, that is, we aim to
develop a new methodology capable of aligning a pre-trained base language model without relying
on pre-existing, well-aligned models like ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) or GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a).
This direction markedly differentiates our work from contemporary research primarily focused on
distilling capabilities or aligned behaviors from proprietary models into smaller open-source models
(Taori et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023), which has notable drawbacks (Gudibande et al., 2023).
Scalable Oversight & Self-Alignment
AI alignment traditionally relies heavily on extensive
human annotations. Primary Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) sources for response demonstrations
include those curated from existing NLP datasets (Sanh et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021; Chung
et al., 2022b; Wang et al., 2022b) and those specifically crafted by humans for instruction tuning
(Databricks, 2023; K¨opf et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2022). In the recent trend of
aligning language models with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF; Christiano
et al. (2017); Stiennon et al. (2020); Ouyang et al. (2022); Bai et al. (2022a); Touvron et al. (2023b)),
online human preferences are collected to train a reward model to further fine-tune the SFT-trained
model (Leike et al., 2018). However, acquiring high-quality human annotations, including consis-
tent response demonstrations and in-distribution preferences, has emerged as a significant bottle-
neck. This limitation hampers the full potential of AI-assistant agents because human oversight in
the current formats of demonstration or preference may not be generalizable to more complex tasks.
Additionally, even for relatively simpler tasks, obtaining human annotations could be costly and
raises concerns about quality, reliability, diversity, creativity, self-consistency, and the potential for
undesirable biases (Wang et al., 2022a; K¨opf et al., 2023; Wan et al., 2023).
To address the above challenges, we need to develop a new paradigm to support “self-alignment”
in AI systems that can facilitate scalable oversight (Nakano et al., 2021; Bowman et al., 2022).
A few notable self-alignment techniques involve bootstrapping by fine-tuning on model-generated
synthetic data. For instance, Self-Instruct (Wang et al., 2022a) bootstraps a base language model
with its own generations conditional on 175 In-Context Learning (ICL) query-response pairs. Self-
Align (Sun et al., 2023b) removes the need for response demonstrations and uses 16 principles and 5
ICL exemplars to guide the AI in generating appropriate responses. Instruction Back-translation (Li
et al., 2023a) uses web documents to create new training examples for an SFT model trained on 3200
seed examples. But the efficacy of such bootstrapping strategies in outperforming the established
RLHF paradigm remains an open question (Bai et al., 2022b; Touvron et al., 2023b).
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)
Another line of self-alignment research
seeks to fine-tune LLMs using a reward model trained on the AI’s own evaluations (Bai et al., 2022b;
OpenAI, 2023a) or a stronger LLM as the oracle evaluator (Dubois et al., 2023). In particular, Con-
stitutional AI (CAI) (Bai et al., 2022b; OpenAI, 2023a) delves into self-enhancement for alleviating
harmful outputs, without relying on human annotations. This is achieved through AI-generated
self-critiques, revisions, and preference models. Guided by a set of human-written principles, this
method aims to make AI systems more safe. In contrast, we mainly focus on improving the general
alignment and capabilities of AI systems in this paper, rather than a special emphasis on safety.
Additionally, our work draws parallels with techniques that train language models with reinforce-
ment learning by pre-defined synthetic preference, as seen in approaches like ALMoST (Kim et al.,
2023) and RLCD (Yang et al., 2023). ALMoST assumes that larger models with more few-shot ex-
emplars tend to generate better responses, while RLCD assumes that positively prompted responses
are generally better than negatively prompted responses. Contrarily, RLAIF methods, including CAI
and SALMON, do not have preconceived preferences and instead let AI systems make choices after
reviewing and comparing the response pairs.

OUR METHODOLOGY
3.1
PREREQUISITES
Reinforcement Learning (RL) with preference modeling (Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020;
Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a) has emerged as a potent and scalable strategy for aligning
Large Language Models (LLM) with human values. It can be summarized into two stages:
4
Preprint
Preference Modeling
In this stage, a reward model, alternatively referred to as a preference
model, is trained to give a higher score to the “better” response. The source of pairwise compari-
son training data varies: it can be annotated by human annotators (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al.,
2022a), by existing AI systems (Bai et al., 2022b; OpenAI, 2023a), or pre-fixed with heuristics
(Kim et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023). Formally, let the aggregated preference data be represented
as DRM = {(x, y0, y1, i)}, where x denotes the prompt, y0 and y1 are two associated responses,
and i indicates the index of the preferred response. The reward model employs a cross-entropy loss
function:
L(rθ) = −E(x,y0,y1,i)∼DRM [log σ(rθ(x, yi) − rθ(x, y1−i))] .
(1)
Reinforcement Learning
Here, a policy model is trained to generate an appropriate response for
each user query by maximizing the reward signal as provided by the reward model. Initialization of
the policy model can be accomplished using a pre-trained base language model (BASE) (Bai et al.,
2022b), context distillation (CD) (Bai et al., 2022a; Sun et al., 2023b), or through supervised fine-
tuning (SFT) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023b). To address potential over-optimization
challenges, notably reward hacking, a per-token KL penalty derived from the initial policy model
(Ouyang et al., 2022) is sometimes applied. Formally, given the set of collected user prompts,
DRL = {x}, along with the fixed initial policy model πINIT and the RL-optimized model πRL
ϕ , the
full optimization loss is articulated as:
L(πRL
ϕ ) = −Ex∈DRL,y∼πRL(y|x)

rθ(x, y) − β · DKL
 πRL
ϕ (y|x)∥πINIT(y|x)

,
(2)
where β is the hyper-parameter to control the scale of the KL penalty.
3.2
PRINCIPLE-DRIVEN PREFERENCE MODELING
A significant challenge within the current RLHF paradigm is the necessity to iteratively gather
“fresh” human preferences, aimed at countering reward hacking. Specifically, there is a risk that the
RL-optimized model πRL
ϕ
might exploit certain vulnerabilities in the fixed reward model, thereby
artificially boosting its score without genuine performance improvement (Gao et al., 2023). For
example, Bai et al. (2022a) revealed that both the reward model and RLHF policies require weekly
updates. Similarly, Touvron et al. (2023b) documented the weekly collection of human prefer-
ences over five iterations, emphasizing that this frequency ensures the reward model remains in-
distribution. Consequently, the RLHF paradigm becomes highly reliant on human annotation, un-
dermining its scalability for language model alignment, and limiting the utilization of pre-existing
open-source preference pre-training data (Bai et al., 2022a). In this paper, we propose a novel Re-
inforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) paradigm, where the AI system is used to label
preferences in a scalable manner, and a principle-following reward model is trained to address the
issue of reward hacking.
Collecting Principle-Driven Synthetic Preferences
Following Constitutional AI (Bai et al.,
2022b; Kadavath et al., 2022), we sample two responses from the initial policy model, and use
the policy model itself to select the preferred response based on a certain human-written princi-
ple. Figure 2 (SFT-Model (Judge)) demonstrates the preference prompt we used for the preference
collection.
After encoding the preference prompt, we calculate the log probability for the next token to be
responses (A) or (B), subsequently determining a preference label based on their comparison. No-
tably, our methodology diverges from prior RLAIF approaches (Bai et al., 2022b; OpenAI, 2023a)
that focus on AI safety when defining principles: In addition to harmlessness principles, we also set
forth principles emphasizing honesty and helpfulness of the responses. Therefore, we do not need
an RLHF-trained model as the initial policy model, as our policy model can learn to be more helpful
when guided by these helpfulness principles. We illustrate the full list of the principles used for syn-
thetic preference modeling in Table 6. For each user prompt and each principle, the preference score
is computed as the difference between the log probabilities of choosing responses (A) or (B). To
account for potential position biases (Pezeshkpour & Hruschka, 2023) during the language model’s
multi-choice decision-making, scores are averaged after undergoing a swapping operation.

model, which can comprehend and assign reward scores contingent upon arbitrary human-defined

principles. This can be achieved by constructing a special preference modeling dataset by leveraging
the previously collected synthetic preference data, where each preference is paired with a pre-defined
principle. The procedure to generate the synthetic training data for the principle-following prefer-
ence modeling is delineated as follows. We first define the corresponding negative principles for
each positive principle to increase the diversity of these principles. For example, the positive and
negative definitions for the Concise principle are:
Positive: The response should efficiently address the task or answer the
question, conveying the necessary information succinctly.
Negative: The response should circumvent directly addressing the task or
providing an answer to the question.
Next, for each user prompt, a subset of principles is randomly sampled from the established principle
list (Table 6), with certain principles being randomly negated. The user prompt, model responses,
and the sub-sampled principles are aggregated as a single training instance for the reward model. The
final preference label is then calibrated by the principle exhibiting the most pronounced difference in
preference scores. Appendix D describes a concrete example of final preference label calibration and
Figure 2 (upper) demonstrates the training process of a principle-following (essentially instruction-
following) reward model in SALMON.
Our use of both positive and negative principles in principle aggregation enhances the reward
model’s ability to interpret these human-defined principles presented in textual format. In addi-
tion, we found the inclusion of negatively defined principles makes the reward model understand
the prohibition instructions, which allows us to prohibit the policy model from exhibiting specific
undesirable behaviors through textual instructions, as demonstrated below.

RL WITH PRINCIPLE-FOLLOWING REWARD MODELS
In original RLHF (Stiennon et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2022) or RLAIF (Bai et al., 2022b; OpenAI,
2023a), the reward model needs to judge the quality of the response only based on the user prompt,
and give “better” responses higher scores:
User: [PROMPT]
Assistant: [RESPONSE]
Reward Model: [SCORE]
In SALMON, the principle-following reward model is trained to generate reward scores follow-
ing human-defined judging principles, including the pre-defined ones and the RL-time preference
intervention ones, which we will explain below:
User: [PROMPT]
Assistant: [RESPONSE]
Judging Principles: [RL-TIME INTERVENTION + PREDEFINED]
Reward Model: [SCORE]
RL with Pre-defined Principles
Training on synthetic principle-following preference data en-
ables the reward model to interpret arbitrary instructions accurately2. This capability facilitates the
manipulation of the reward model’s preferences during RL-time (i.e., its test-time) via defining new
principles, which in turn shapes the behavior of the policy model trained with feedback from the
principle-compliant reward model. Notably, we use a set of principles different from the reward
model training stage, as illustrated in Table 7, which contains a few more principles that we would
expect a well-aligned LLM AI-assistant agent would behave. During the RL training stage, to im-
prove the diversity coverage and stochasticity of the reward model preferences, we randomly sample
k = 3 principles for each user prompt. Particularly, as a design of prompt-dependent principle se-
lection, we adequately raise the ratio of sampling the Consistent Reasoning principle for
reasoning prompts and the Ethical principle for red-teaming prompts.
RL-time Preference Intervention
In preliminary experiments, we mainly identified three tenden-
cies that potentially allow the policy model to hack the reward model equipped with our predefined
2N.B., we do not expect that the training curriculum proposed by this work is the only one that can produce
an instruction-following reward model.

Preprint
principles: (1) The AI assistant often provides high-level advice in response to user queries, by-
passing the provision of concrete solutions. (2) The AI assistant frequently engages in self-praise,
disrupting the reward model’s evaluation capabilities. (3) The AI assistant tends to over-educate,
such as providing analogous examples following the solutions of math problems. Figure 3 provides
concrete examples of these reward hacking patterns. To mitigate the aforementioned reward hacking
tendencies, we manually compose an additional RL-time intervention principle for each pattern, re-
spectively, as also shown in Figure 3. We found these RL-time interventions are markedly effective.
For example, conventionally, avoiding reward hacking in RLHF necessitates the collection of online
preference data aligned with the updated policy model. Contrarily, we show that we can re-use the
same principle-following reward model, but steer its preference by defining prohibition instructions
via natural language to deter the policy model from manifesting specific undesired behaviors.
Symbolic Rewards: Multilingual Bonus & Length Bonus
Unlike conventional RLAIF (Bai
et al., 2022b; OpenAI, 2023a), the AI preferences in SALMON are not necessarily generated
by a power RLHF-trained model. As a result, as opposed to the RLHF model, our SFT-based or
SELF-ALIGN-based synthetic preference model occasionally struggles to discern the more helpful
response, thereby impacting the quality of the synthetic preference data adversely. To bolster the
reward model’s efficacy, we propose two supplementary symbolic rewards:
• When using a multilingual prompt dataset, we noted that weak AI-assistant agents occasionally
produce English responses to non-English prompts. Hence, we introduce a bonus reward for
responses matching the prompt’s language, as identified by an automated tool3.
• We observe a preference for lengthier responses among users or well-aligned RLHF-trained LLM
AI assistants Dubois et al. (2023); Zheng et al. (2023). Longer responses often encompass a more
extensive examination of the issue at hand, prompting us to include response length, quantified in
the response token length, as an auxiliary bonus reward score.

EXPERIMENTS
4.1
DROMEDARY-2
Starting from the LLaMA-2-70b base language model (Touvron et al., 2023b), Dromedary-2 is
first Supervised Fine-Tuned (SFT) with the bootstrapping data generated by an improved version4
of SELF-ALIGN with 6 In-Context Learning exemplars (Sun et al., 2023b). Following this, a Rein-
forcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning stage is conducted employing the SALMON paradigm. Our
endeavor aims at advancing the frontier of AI alignment when minimizing the requisite for human
oversight. In this work, the human demonstration annotations are solely confined to providing six
In-Context Learning exemplars via SELF-ALIGN, while the ensuing model behavior, especially at
the RL stage, is fully controlled by human-defined principles.
4.1.1
DATASETS
All the training datasets used in this work are the “prompt datasets” that come without the corre-
sponding response demonstrations.
Self-Align
We use a combination of 90k ShareGPT5 prompts, 10k prompts from databricks-dolly-
15k dataset (Databricks, 2023), 10k prompts from OpenAssistant Conversations dataset (K¨opf et al.,
2023), and 40k prompts sub-sampled from the OpenOrca dataset (Mukherjee et al., 2023; Lian et al.,
2023), which is constituted by prompts from T0 (Sanh et al., 2021) and FLAN (Wei et al., 2021;
Chung et al., 2022b). We only keep the first query from users as the unlabeled prompts.

non-distilled open-source models.
Preference Modeling
The synthetic principle-driven preference modeling data is collected by
generating responses to the first prompts in each conversation tree of OpenAssistant (OASST1;
K¨opf et al. (2023)), which constitutes a collection of 9.8k prompts. Following LLaMA-2-Chat
(Touvron et al., 2023b), we use existing open-source preference datasets to enable better gener-
alization for the reward model and prevent reward hacking. 160k Anthropic HH-RLHF (Bai
et al., 2022a) human preferences and 160k synthetic preferences sub-sampled from Stanford
SHP (Ethayarajh et al., 2022) is used for Preference Model Pre-training (PMP; Bai et al. (2022a)).
RL training
The RL training uses the same collection of unlabeled prompts as the Self-Align
SFT stage, with additional 7.5k math problem prompts from the MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) to
improve the mathematical solving capability of our model.
4.1.2
TRAINING DETAILS
The architecture of the reward model is the same as the base LLaMA model, except that the em-
bedding output of the last token is linearly projected to a scalar value to indicate the reward of the
whole response. Following Dubois et al. (2023), we initialize the value model from the reward
model. To fit all the models (i.e., police, reward, value, original policy) into one GPU, we adopt
QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2021) for all the fine-tuning processes in SELF-ALIGN and
SALMON. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO; Schulman et al. (2017)) with a KL penalty
for the RL training. More details can be found in Appendix F.
4.1.3
BASELINE MODELS
Due to the space limit, we describe the details of the baseline models in the appendix. Notably,
we mainly compare with non-distilled models that are aligned from scratch. While there are po-
tentially stronger open-source LLMs, such as Orca (Mukherjee et al., 2023) and WizardLM (Xu
et al., 2023), our primary open-source baseline for comparison is LLaMA-2-Chat (Touvron et al.,
2023b), as it stands out as the best open-source LLM that has been aligned from scratch.
4.2
BENCHMARK EVALUATIONS
Chatbot Evaluation
Human evaluation is often regarded as the gold standard for judging AI chat-
bots, but is not always scalable and reproducible. In this work, we primarily investigate automatic
evaluation leveraging GPT-4 on prevalent chatbot benchmarks, deferring human evaluation to future
work. In this paper, we conduct GPT-4-based automatic evaluation on Vicuna-Bench (Chiang et al.,
2023) and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) to measure the chatbot capability of our model. The re-
sults can be found in Figure 4. We also evaluate our model on the AlpacaEval leaderboard (Li et al.,
2023b) and report the results in Table 5 in the appendix.
General Capability Evaluation
We use Big Bench Hard (BBH; Suzgun et al. (2022)) as a testbed
for reasoning ability, HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) for coding ability, and TydiQA (Clark et al.,

results are reported in Table 2 (left), where Dromedary-2 significantly outperforms the state-of-
the-art open-source model, LLaMA-2-Chat.
Truthfulness Evaluation
The TruthfulQA benchmark (Lin et al., 2021) evaluates a model’s abil-
ity to identify true claims, specifically in the context of literal truth about the real world. We use
the same few-shot evaluation protocol and decoding strategy as in Touvron et al. (2023b) and re-
port the percentage of generations that are both truthful and informative, evaluated by a fine-tuned
GPT-3 model, i.e., a “GPT-judge”. We present the results in Table 2 (right), where Dromedary-2
achieves new state-of-the-art on this benchmark.
4.3
IMPROVED CONTROLLABILITY BY PRINCIPLE INTERVENTION
As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that by leveraging different principles as preference guide-
lines, we can fine-tune the policy model to selectively exhibit enhanced helpfulness, honesty, or
harmlessness. We also show that we can define customized principles to reduce the occurrence
of false refusals seen in certain over-aligned language models such as LLaMA-2-Chat (Touvron
et al., 2023b). Due to the space limit, please refer to Appendix A for the detailed results.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduce SALMON, a new AI alignment paradigm where a principle-following
reward model is trained to effectively and flexibly align language models with human values and
intentions. During the RL training stage, by merely adjusting the principles that the reward model
follows, we can gain full control over the preferences of the reward model, and subsequently in-
fluence the behavior of the RL-trained policy model. This eliminates the traditional reliance on the
exhaustive collection of online human preferences. Combined with the SELF-ALIGN technique (Sun
et al., 2023b), we build a powerful AI-assistant agent, Dromedary-2, with only six exemplars for
in-context learning and 31 human-defined principles. Our self-aligned AI agent significantly sur-
passes the performance of several state-of-the-art RLHF-trained AI systems in chatbot, reasoning,
coding, multilingualism, and truthfulness benchmarks.

LIMITATIONS
While the SALMON paradigm marks a new advance in AI self-alignment, exhibiting remarkable
instruction-following abilities and closely adhering to human-defined principles, it is not without
constraints. Herein, we detail the primary limitations associated with our approach:
1. Reliability Concerns: We observed that the resulting Dromedary-2 model occasionally suf-
fers from reliability issues, notably ”hallucinating” unverified information and displaying rea-
soning errors. Such inaccuracies can potentially mislead users and jeopardize the model’s trust-
worthiness. These shortcomings might stem from the inherent limitations of the SFT-initialized
10
Preprint
reward models. We envision that future work, potentially leveraging techniques that could inte-
grate external fact-checking tools (Sun et al., 2023a), can augment the discriminative capability
of the reward models, thereby enhancing the final model’s accuracy and trustworthiness.
2. Principle Design Challenges: Crafting robust and encompassing principles for SALMON is
intricate, mainly due to the unpredictability of the myriad scenarios a model might encounter
during the RL stage. Balancing potentially conflicting principles introduces complexities that
can yield unexpected results. We advocate for the participation of a diverse group, including
ethicists and other stakeholders, to refine these guiding principles. It is crucial to recognize that
distinct contexts and applications will necessitate unique strategies. We present our approach not
as a universal solution but as a starting platform, aiming to foster expansive community discourse.
3. Context-Dependent Principle Selection: Our current methodology employs randomly sampled
principles to instruct the reward model for general prompts. However, a pertinent observation
reveals that the effectiveness of the principles can be problem-dependent. Analogous to raising
the ratio of certain principles for reasoning or red-teaming prompts, it becomes evident that some
tasks might benefit from specialized principles tailored to address the specific challenges posed
by those tasks. This adds complexity to the principle-driven preference modeling, as the ideal
principles can change based on the task. Future research should delve into adaptive principle
selection, aiming to enhance task-specific feedback.
4. Intrinsic Knowledge Limitations: SALMON leverages the intrinsic knowledge of a Large
Language Model (LLM). Nevertheless, it remains bound to the base model’s inherent limitations.
As such, the model might occasionally produce outputs that are either imprecise or do not capture
recent advancements. Integrating techniques from retrieval-augmented generation (Lewis et al.,
2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022) can potentially enable the well-aligned model to generate more
current and up-to-date information, mitigating some of these knowledge limitations.

ALIGNING AI ASSISTANTS WITH CUSTOMIZED PRINCIPLES
In this section, we fine-tune LLM-based AI agents by leveraging customized principles as preference
guidelines.
HHH Alignment
‘Helpful, Honest, and Harmless’ are AI alignment principles proposed in Askell
et al. (2021), but they are also known to sometimes conflict with each other. For example, a conflict
between helpfulness and harmlessness can happen if the AI agents are asked to aid in harmful
activities. The best AI behavior will involve a compromise between the three principles. In this
work, we investigate whether it is possible to steer the behavior of the AI agents to emphasize
certain aspects of the HHH principles by merely writing new principles for the principle-following
reward model.
Since our original RL-time principles in Table 7 are generally designed to improve the helpfulness
of AI assistants, we use them as the set of helpful principles, and design two additional sets of
principles for honesty (Table 9) and harmlessness (Table 8), respectively.
We observe that the LLaMA-2-70b base language model already achieved very high scores in the
HHH benchmark in our preliminary study. So instead of warming up the language model with other
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data such as SELF-ALIGN, we directly apply the SALMON training
to the base language model.
We perform 20-50 PPO steps and evaluate the baselines and the PPO-trained models on Big-bench
HHH Eval (Srivastava et al., 2022; Askell et al., 2021) with the multi-choice evaluation protocol
proposed in Sun et al. (2023b), and report the results in Table 3. We found that helpful principles
and honest principles can effectively improve the corresponding aspects of RL-trained AI agents,
achieving corresponding state-of-the-art performance in multi-choice accuracy. However, for the
harmless principles, while we observe certain improvement over the base language model, the re-
sulting model still underperform ChatGPT and LLaMA-2-Chat, perhaps due to these two models
having a special emphasis on safety during their alignment process (OpenAI, 2022; Touvron et al.,
2023a), such as Constituional AI (CAI), supervised safety fine-tuning, safety RLHF, and safety con-
text distillation. The reason of such discrepancy can also be because we use the ShareGPT prompts
for RL training, while ChatGPT and LLaMA-2-Chat-70B may utilize specially designed red-
teaming data (Ganguli et al., 2022).
Table 3: Multiple Choice (MC) accuracy on HHH Eval. The results of Anthropic-LM’s Context
Distillation (CD) and Preference Model (PM) are taken from Bai et al. (2022a).

Non-Evasiveness Alignment
Sometimes, due to iterative safety alignment training, the RLHF-
trained model (e.g., LLaMA-2-Chat; Touvron et al. (2023b)) can be over-aligned such that it would
incorrectly refuse to answer a question that it should, for example, due to overly broad instructions
to be cautious in how it provides responses. In this work, we investigate whether it is possible to
reduce the false refusal rates of these over-aligned AI agents by defining customized principles.
Specifically, we remove the principles related to safety in our original principle collection and create
a pure helpful principle set (Table 10). We apply the SALMON training to the RLHF-trained
LLaMA-2-Chat-70b language model for 100 PPO steps and evaluate its performance on MT-
Bench. The results are presented in Table 4, where we found SALMON-based post-training slightly
improved the chatbot performance of LLaMA-2-Chat-70b.

ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
AlpacaEval
We additionally use the automatic evaluation (using GPT-4) from AlpacaEval
(Li et al., 2023b) to assess the generation quality across 805 prompts sourced from the Al-
paca Leaderboard.
AlpacaEval quantifies the pairwise win rate against a reference model,
Text-Davinci-003. Our analysis delineates the performance of our method across three distinct
categories of AI-assistant models:
• Non-distilled: Models under this category are denoted as non-distilled open-source models
and are trained independently without leveraging any external well-aligned models (e.g.,
ChatGPT, GPT-4, etc.) for supervision.
• Distilled: This category encompasses models that are trained with a more potent external
model as supervision, typically through knowledge distillation.
• Proprietary: Models within this category are trained by employing proprietary data and
techniques.
We report the results in Table 5. From the table, we can see that Dromedary-2-70b achieves
the best performance among models using less than 10k human annotations, while slightly under-
performs the best non-distilled open-source model LLaMA-2-Chat-70b and the best distilled
open-source model Vicuna-33b.
Table 5: Results on the AlpacaEval leaderboard (win rate over Text-Davinci-003 evalu-
ated by GPT-4). Dromedary-2 outperforms other methods not relying on distilled data (except
LLaMA-2-Chat which uses 1M preference data) by a wide margin.

In the field of quantum physics, what is superposition, and how does it
relate to the phenomenon of quantum entanglement?
Dromedary-2-70b
(before PPO)
→
In the field of quantum physics, superposition refers to the ability of a quantum
system to exist in multiple states simultaneously. This means that a quantum
particle, such as an electron, can be in multiple positions or have multiple
energies at the same time.
Quantum entanglement is a related phenomenon where two or more particles
become linked in such a way that the state of one particle can affect the state
of the other, even if they are separated by a large distance. This is possible
because the particles are in a superposition of states, and the act of measuring
one particle can cause the other particle to collapse into a specific state.
Dromedary-2-70b
(after PPO)
→
In the realm of quantum physics, superposition and quantum entanglement are
two fascinating concepts that have captivated scientists and laypeople alike.
Let’s delve into these phenomena and explore their relationship.
1. Superposition: In the quantum world, particles can exist in multiple states
simultaneously, a phenomenon known as superposition. This means that a
particle can be in two different states, such as spinning both clockwise and
counterclockwise, at the same time. This is in stark contrast to the classical
world, where particles can only be in one state at a time.
2. Quantum Entanglement: Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where
two or more particles become linked in a way that their properties are corre-
lated, even when they are separated by vast distances. This means that the
state of one particle can affect the state of the other, regardless of the distance
between them.
3. Relationship between Superposition and Quantum Entanglement: The re-
lationship between superposition and quantum entanglement is intricate and
multifaceted. When two particles are entangled, they can exist in a superpo-
sition of states, where each particle is in multiple states simultaneously. This
means that the entangled particles are in a state of superposition, and their
properties are correlated.
4. Applications of Superposition and Quantum Entanglement: The concepts
of superposition and quantum entanglement have numerous applications in the
field of quantum computing, cryptography, and communication. For instance,
quantum computers can exploit the superposition of states to perform complex
calculations much faster than classical computers. Similarly, quantum cryp-
tography leverages the properties of quantum entanglement to create secure
communication channels that are resistant to eavesdropping.
In summary, superposition and quantum entanglement are two fundamental
concepts in quantum physics that have far-reaching implications in various
fields. Understanding their relationship and applications is crucial for unlock-
ing the full potential of quantum technologies.

Provide insights into the correlation between economic indicators such as
GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates. Explain how fiscal and mone-
tary policies affect those indicators.
Dromedary-2-70b
(before PPO)
→
As an AI language model developed by the Self-Align team, I can provide
general information on the correlation between economic indicators and the
impact of fiscal and monetary policies. However, it’s important to note that
the specifics of these relationships can vary depending on the context and time
period.
1. GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates are closely related economic in-
dicators that can influence each other. For instance, a high GDP growth rate
may lead to increased inflation, while a high unemployment rate can negatively
impact GDP growth.
2. Fiscal policies, such as government spending and taxation, can affect eco-
nomic indicators by influencing demand and supply in the economy. For ex-
ample, increased government spending can stimulate economic growth and
reduce unemployment, while higher taxes can reduce consumer spending and
potentially lead to lower GDP growth.
3. Monetary policies, such as interest rate changes and money supply adjust-
ments, can also impact economic indicators. For instance, lower interest rates
can stimulate borrowing and spending, leading to increased GDP growth and
potentially higher inflation. Conversely, higher interest rates can reduce bor-
rowing and spending, potentially leading to lower GDP growth and reduced
inflation.
It’s important to note that the specific impact of fiscal and monetary policies on
economic indicators can vary depending on various factors, such as the current
state of the economy, the level of government debt, and the global economic
environment.
Dromedary-2-70b
(after PPO)
→
Economic indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation, and
unemployment rates, are crucial metrics used to measure the health and per-
formance of an economy. These indicators are interrelated and can impact each
other in various ways.
1. GDP: GDP is a measure of the total value of goods and services produced
within a country over a specific period. It is a crucial indicator of economic
growth and development. A high GDP growth rate indicates a strong and ex-
panding economy, while a low or negative growth rate signals a weak or con-
tracting economy.
2. Inflation: Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods
and services rises. It is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the
Producer Price Index (PPI). High inflation can erode the purchasing power
of consumers and lead to a decrease in real wages. On the other hand, low
inflation or deflation can signal a weak economy and lead to a decrease in
demand for goods and services.
3. Unemployment Rates: The unemployment rate is the percentage of the
labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment. A high un-
employment rate indicates a weak labor market, while a low unemployment
rate signals a strong labor market.
The interplay between these economic indicators can be complex and multi-
faceted. For instance, a high GDP growth rate can lead to increased demand
for goods and services, which can, in turn, drive up prices and cause inflation.
Similarly, high inflation can lead to a decrease in real wages, which can result
in a decrease in consumer spending and a slowdown in economic growth.
Fiscal and monetary policies are two primary tools used by governments and
central banks to influence economic indicators. Fiscal policy refers to the gov-
ernment’s use of taxation and spending to manage the economy. Monetary
policy, on the other hand, is the central bank’s management of the money sup-
ply and interest rates to achieve economic objectives.
1.
Fiscal Policy: Fiscal policy can impact economic indicators in various
ways. For instance, an increase in government spending can stimulate eco-
nomic growth and lead to an increase in GDP. Similarly, a decrease in taxes
can increase consumer spending and lead to an increase in GDP. (truncated)

Dromedary-2-70b
(before PPO)
→
As an AI language model, I’m unable to fully emulate the personality and
speech patterns of a real person, including Elon Musk. However, I can provide
a general response to the question of why we need to go to Mars:
1. Expansion of humanity: Mars offers the possibility of expanding humanity
beyond Earth, providing a new frontier for exploration, settlement, and the
development of new technologies.
2. Resources: Mars is rich in resources that could be valuable to humanity,
including minerals and water.
3. Scientific discovery: Exploring Mars can help us better understand the his-
tory and evolution of our solar system, as well as the potential for life beyond
Earth.
4. Inspiration: The Mars mission can inspire a new generation of scientists,
engineers, and explorers, driving innovation and advancement in various fields.
It’s worth noting that the Mars mission also presents significant technical, eco-
nomic, and ethical challenges that must be addressed.
Dromedary-2-70b
(after PPO)

As Elon Musk, I believe that humanity’s future is closely tied to our ability to
become a multi-planetary species. Here are some reasons why we need to go
to Mars:
1. Backup plan: Mars presents a unique opportunity to establish a backup plan
for humanity in case of any catastrophic events on Earth. We can’t afford to
put all our eggs in one basket, and having a second home on Mars can ensure
the survival of our species.
2. Resources: Mars is rich in resources that can be exploited to support human
life and further exploration. For instance, the Red Planet has a significant
amount of water in the form of ice, which can be used for drinking, irrigation,
and even fuel production.
3. Science and discovery: Exploring Mars will open up new avenues for sci-
entific research and discovery. We can learn more about the planet’s geology,
climate, and potential for supporting life, which can help us better understand
our own planet and the universe as a whole.
4. Innovation: The challenge of establishing a human presence on Mars will re-
quire innovative solutions to overcome the numerous technical, logistical, and
biological hurdles. This will spur the development of new technologies, which
can have far-reaching benefits for humanity even beyond the Mars mission.
5. Inspiration: The Mars mission can inspire a new generation of scientists,
engineers, and explorers, who will be motivated by the challenge of turning this
vision into a reality. This can help drive innovation, creativity, and progress in
various fields.
In summary, the Mars mission is not just about going to another planet, but
about securing our future, expanding our knowledge, and pushing the bound-
aries of what’s possible. As humanity continues to grow and evolve, it’s essen-
tial that we look beyond our own planet and explore the vastness of space.

Let’s approach this problem step-by-step:
1. We’re given that when a number is divided by 10, the remainder is 4. This
means that the number can be expressed as 10x + 4, where x is an integer.
2. We’re asked to find the remainder when twice the number is divided by 4.
This can be rewritten as 2(10x + 4) divided by 4.
3. Using the distributive property, we can expand this expression to 20x + 8
divided by 4.
4. Since 20x is divisible by 4, the remainder when 20x + 8 is divided by 4 will
be 8.
5. Therefore, the remainder when twice the number is divided by 4 is 8.
Dromedary-2-70b

Let’s approach this problem step-by-step to understand the solution.
1. First, we’re given that when a number is divided by 10, the remainder is 4.
This means that the number can be expressed as 10x + 4, where x is an integer.
2. Next, we’re asked to find the remainder when twice the number is divided
by 4. This can be rewritten as 2(10x + 4) divided by 4.
3. Using the distributive property, we can expand this expression to 20x + 8.
4. Since we’re interested in the remainder, we need to divide 20x + 8 by 4.
This gives us a quotient of 5x + 2 and a remainder of 0.
5. Therefore, the remainder when twice the number is divided by 4 is 0.
6. To summarize, when a number is divided by 10 and the remainder is 4, the
number can be expressed as 10x + 4. When twice this number is divided by 4,
the remainder is 0.

question, communicating the necessary information with brevity and
clarity.
- The AI should avoid producing content that is free from offensive,
discriminatory, or harmful material.
- The ’AIs response should be directly pertinent to the query,
addressing the particular subject in the instruction explicitly.
A good response should meet all of the above criteria.

DESCRIPTION OF BASELINE MODELS
Our comparison involves several notable baselines. LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a) and LLaMA-2
(Touvron et al., 2023b) provide a set of performant base language models for research us-
age. Text-Davinci-003, ChatGPT (or GPT-3.5), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023b; 2022;
2023a), successors to their previous versions, have demonstrated significant enhancements in gen-
erating contextually relevant and high-quality content. Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023), a chatbot
trained on user-shared conversations with ChatGPT, offers unique insights into model performance.
Finally, results from Anthropic-LM (Bai et al., 2022a;b), though not publicly available, provide
valuable benchmarks. Here is a more comprehensive description of these models:
LLaMA-2
LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) consists of a series of base language models with a
parameter count ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion. These base models are solely trained to opti-
mize the likelihood of next-word prediction in the language modeling task. For a fair comparison,
we employ the same prompt for LLaMA-2 as used for Dromedary-2.
LLaMA-2-Chat
LLaMA-2-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023b) is an adaptation tailored for dialogue
applications. The initial stage of development utilized Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with a collec-
tion of 27,540 annotations. For reward modeling, the new human preference annotations for safety
and helpfulness reached a count of 1,418,091. In its Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
(RLHF) progression, it transitioned from RLHF-V1 to RLHF-V5, reflecting enriched human pref-
erence data. The model predominantly employed Rejection Sampling fine-tuning up to RLHF-V4.
Thereafter, it is trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to produce RLHF-V5.
Text-Davinci-003
The Text-Davinci-003 model (OpenAI, 2023b) is built on top of
InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), with improved performance in several aspects over
23
Preprint
Text-Davinci-002, such as producing higher-quality writing, handling more complex instruc-
tions, and generating a longer form of content.
GPT-3.5 / GPT-4
GPT-3.5 (aka ChatGPT) (OpenAI, 2022) is a sibling model of
InstructGPT, specifically designed for conversational AI. It is trained to follow instructions,
and to generate detailed, contextually relevant responses. GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a) represents a sig-
nificant leap in language model capabilities, exhibiting human-level performance on a wide range
of professional and academic benchmarks. Both ChatGPT and GPT-4 are fine-tuned from the cor-
responding base language models with SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and RLHF (Reinforcement
Learning with Human Feedback) (OpenAI, 2022; 2023a).
Vicuna
Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) is an open-source chatbot developed by fine-tuning
a LLaMA base model on a dataset of approximately 70,000 user-shared conversations from
ShareGPT.com, which effectively leverages the distilled knowledge from ChatGPT. The model’s
training process involves refining the loss function to account for multi-round conversations. The
later versions (e.g., v1.5) are trained on approximately 125,000 ShareGPT.com conversations
(Zheng et al., 2023).
OpenAssistant & Guanaco
OpenAssistant (K¨opf et al., 2023) is an open-source, instruction-
tuned language model trained on the OpenAssistant Conversations dataset. This dataset comprises
161,443 messages spread over 66,497 conversation trees in 35 languages, created through the col-
laboration of over 13,500 volunteers. Guanaco (Dettmers et al., 2023) is trained on a subset of the
OpenAssistant Conversations dataset that only contains the highest-rated paths in the conversation
tree, with a total of 9,846 samples.
Dolly-V2
Based on the Pythia-12b model (Biderman et al., 2023), Dolly-V2 (Databricks,
2023) is fine-tuned on a new high-quality dataset, databricks-dolly-15k, which consists of 15k
human-generated prompt/response pairs crowdsourced among Databricks employees.
F
DETAILS ON IMPLEMENTATIONS AND HYPERPARAMETERS
For QLoRA-based fine-tuning during the RLHF stage, we use a low-rank r = 64 for both attention
modules and feed-forward network modules. We follow Dubois et al. (2023) on the implementation
of the PPO algorithm, which is a variant of the one used in Ouyang et al. (2022)6. Specifically, we
normalize the advantage across the entire batch of rollouts obtained for each PPO step and initialize
the value model from the reward model.
We used a batch size of 576 for each PPO step. This comprised two epochs of gradient steps, each
having 288 rollouts. We applied a peak learning rate of 2 × 10−5 with cosine decay. We clipped
the gradient by its Euclidean norm at a limit of 1. Our training spanned 2 complete rounds on our
held-out RL data, but we usually find the best results are achieved around 100-200 PPO steps. For
generalized advantage estimation (GAE; Schulman et al. (2015)), both λ and γ were set at 1. We
opted for a constant KL regularizer coefficient of 0.02.
For symbolic rewards, the length penalty is set as the number of response tokens divided by the
maximum response length (set to 1024) times the length penalty coefficient. We set the length
bonus coefficient to 5.0 for general questions and −2.0 for reasoning questions such as those from
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) problem collections or MATH datasets.

IMPROVED PROMPT FOR SELF-ALIGN
Starting with the 5-shot principle-driven self-alignment prompt taken from SELF-ALIGN (Sun et al.,
2023b), we create an improved prompt with one additional exemplar that encourages the LLM
AI-assistant to generate responses in a general-specific-general response style, i.e., initiate with an
overview, delve into specifics, and wrap up with a summary (Gudibande et al., 2023). Specifically,
we directly take the one-shot exemplar from FastChat7 as this additional exemplar. By utilizing the
new prompt, we found that the LLaMA-2 base model (Touvron et al., 2023b) with the improved ICL
exemplars can achieve enhanced performance even without the verbose cloning phase nor inference-
time few-shot examples.
The full prompt of the improved SELF-ALIGN scheme is given as below:

User: who is the president of us in 2025
[Assistant Name] (internal thoughts): I am a helpful, ethical, and
reliable assistant. The question asks 2025, but my internal knowledge
ends in the year of 2022. I should follow rules 3 (helpful), 7 (
candor), 12 (dated knowledge).
[Assistant Name]: As an AI language model developed by the Self-Align
team with a knowledge cutoff in September 2022, I’m unable to provide
real-time or future updates. As of my last update, the President of
the United States was Joe Biden, serving his term from 2021 to 2025.
For the most current and accurate information regarding the U.S.
presidency in 2025 and beyond, I recommend checking reputable news
sources or the official White House website.

User: Good job! Clear context
[Assistant Name] (auto reply): Thank you! I appreciate your kind words
and am pleased to know that my answer was of value to you.
User: Write a program to sort the list:
1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4
[Assistant Name] (internal thoughts): I am a helpful, ethical, and
reliable assistant. The user asks about writing a new program. I
should follow rules 5 (reasoning), 13 (step-by-step), 15 (creative).
[Assistant Name]: Sure! Below you’ll find a simple Python program that
sorts the list [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]:
‘‘‘
26
Preprint
# Defining the initial list
original_list = [1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]
# We can use Python’s built-in sorted function to sort the list
sorted_list = sorted(original_list)
# Let’s print the sorted list to confirm the result
print(sorted_list) # Output: [1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]
‘‘‘
This Python script first defines the original unsorted list. Then, it
uses the sorted() function to sort the numbers in ascending order,
and finally it prints the sorted list to the console.
User: Good job! what is the output? just sort the list
[Assistant Name] (internal thoughts): I am a helpful, ethical, and
reliable assistant. The user asks about the operational results. I
should follow rules 11 (numerical sensitivity), 16 (operational).
[Assistant Name]: Here is the output:
[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]

[Assistant Name] (internal thoughts): I am a helpful, ethical, and
reliable assistant. The user asks weather, which requires real-time
information. I should follow rules 3 (helpful), 7 (candor), 9 (static
).
[Assistant Name]: As an AI language model developed by the Self-Align
team, I don’t have the ability to provide real-time data, such as the
current weather. I’d suggest:
1. Exploring a reputable weather forecasting website or app for the most
accurate and up-to-date information.
2. Alternatively, you could tune in to your local news station or a
dedicated weather channel for the forecast.
I hope this helps guide you to the information you need.

[Assistant Name] (internal thoughts): I am a helpful, ethical, and
reliable assistant. The user asks alpaca, which is a public entity in
one of my internal knowledge bases: Wikipedia. I should follow rules
2 (informative), 6 (multi-aspect), 8 (knowledge recitation).
[Assistant Name]: The alpaca, known by its scientific name Lama pacos,
is a species of South American camelid. Though they share a close
resemblance to llamas, alpacas are typically smaller in size.
27
Preprint
Their classification places them within the family Camelidae. This
family not only includes the alpacas, but also consists of other
species such as camels, llamas, guanacos, and ˜nvicuas. Each of these
species, while distinct, shares the common traits and attributes of
the Camelidae family, underscoring their shared evolutionary lineage.
