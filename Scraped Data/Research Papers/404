Background: Adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may 
experience sleep problems doubly suffering from the disease and side effects 
of stimulant medications. Physical activity (PA) is known to produce numerous 
beneficial effects in adults. However, it was not well-characterized whether PA 
would still be effective in this situation. The main objective of the current study was 
to examine the relationship between PA and sleep among adult ADHD patients 
who were using stimulant medications and quantify the form of this association.
Methods: Adult ADHD participants with stimulant medications use condition 
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database 
between January 1, 2013, and March 2020 (prepandemic) were included in the 
cross-sectional analysis. Weighted logistic regression was performed to assess 
the relationship between PA level and sleep. A restricted cubic spline model was 
used to relax the linear relationship assumptions and investigate the associations 
between the risk of trouble sleeping and time spent engaging in moderate-to-
vigorous PA per week.
Results: A total of 162 eligible adult ADHD participants who reported using 
stimulant medicines were included. Participants who adhered to the general 
recommendation of guidelines in the US of 150  min per week of moderate-to-
vigorous PA had a significant lower risk of complaining of trouble sleeping (OR: 
0.26, 95% CI: 0.10–0.67, p  =  0.006), and this association was seen in men (OR: 
0.23, 95% CI: 0.09–0.56, p  =  0.002), but was not seen in women (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 
0.27–1.88, p  =  0.500). Restricted cubic spline analysis showed that the incidence 
of trouble sleeping gradually decreased after at least 105  min of moderate-
intensity PA per week in participants (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.92–1.14). A significant 
difference appeared after 341 min (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76–0.99), and the curve 
leveled after 1,250  min (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.46–0.79).
Conclusion: Our findings observed associations between PA and sleep condition 
in the adult ADHD patients with stimulant medication use population. Moderate-
to-vigorous PA may be beneficial to sleep in adults with ADHD who were using 
stimulants and thus should be recommended as part of a healthy lifestyle. Gender 
difference should be  considered as an important factor for further studies to 
examine these associations and explore potential mechanisms.

Introduction
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common 
neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder in childhood that is 
characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity, which 
cause functional impairment and lead to difficulties in academic 
achievement and daily life (1). The prevalence of ADHD in children 
and adolescents is estimated to be 5.29 to 7.2% around the world, and 
this number is above 10% in China (2). Furthermore, ADHD is not 
confined to childhood or adolescence, with nearly 60% of children 
with ADHD experiencing symptoms into adulthood, causing 
disruptions at work and in personal relationships (3). The prevalence 
of ADHD in adults has been shown to be 2.5% in a systematic review 
of epidemiological studies (4) and 2.8% in the most current World 
Health Organization (WHO) Mental Health Survey across 10 
countries (5). It is worth noting that the incidence of adult ADHD is 
likely to be underestimated because ADHD is often considered a 
childhood disorder that improves with age, and the fourth edition of 
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) 
criteria is insensitive to the adult population (4, 5). Therefore, adult 
ADHD should attract much attention.
Executive function impairments are a defining trait among 
individuals with ADHD and are a current focus of academic research. 
Additionally, ADHD has been associated with sleep problems, similar 
to other neurodevelopmental disorders. It is estimated that up to 85% 
of adults with ADHD have sleep disturbances (6). These disturbances 
can manifest as long sleep latency, difficulty falling and staying asleep, 
altered total sleep duration, sleep phase delay syndrome, increased 
periodic limb movements when sleeping, and drowsiness during the 
day (7, 8). Fuller-Thomson et al. reported a substantial link between 
ADHD and insomnia, with those who self-reported having ADHD 
being five times more likely to suffer from insomnia (OR = 5.18) than 
those without ADHD (9). Previous studies have reported that sleep 
deprivation exerts multiple effects on neurobehavioral and cognitive 
systems, including attention and emotional regulation. As a result, 
sleep disturbances in ADHD may affect the core psychopathology of 
the condition. In recent times, there has been an increasing number 
of adults diagnosed with ADHD and receiving prescribed stimulant 
medications treatment (10, 11). Methylphenidate, a central nervous 
system stimulant, has been tested extensively in clinical trials on adults 
with ADHD, but the overall benefits and risks remain unclear due to 
concerns about how these trials were designed and how the results 
were reported. Many previous research results revealed that stimulant 
medications have been shown to provide marked benefits in symptoms 
of ADHD, but cause disruptions in circadian rhythms and sleep that 
may negatively affect mood regulation (12–14). Some researchers have 
also noted that contrary to sedatives and hypnotics, which reduce 
brain activity and increase sleepiness, stimulants affect the body and 
central nervous system, inducing heightened alertness, difficulties 
falling asleep and delay of circadian rhythmicity (13, 14). In general, 
adult ADHD patients who take stimulant medicines are particularly 
vulnerable because they are frequently ignored and also may 
experience sleep problems doubly suffering from the disease and 
stimulant medications.
Physical activity (PA) has been shown to improve sleep quality for 
many people. Specifically, moderate-to-vigorous exercise can improve 
the quality of sleep for adults by speeding up the process of falling 
asleep and decreasing the amount of time spent awake in bed at night. 
Moreover, engaging in PA can alleviate daytime sleepiness and reduce 
the need for sleep medications for some people. The mechanisms by 
which PA improves sleep include mild body warming after exercise, 
improvement of vagus nerve function (the vagus nerve mainly plays 
an inhibitory role in promoting sleep), regulation of cortisol and other 
endocrine hormone fluctuations, and mood enhancement resulting 
in relaxation (15). The PA guidelines from the US and WHO 
recommend that adults engage in moderate-intensity PA for at least 
150 min/week or vigorous PA for ≥75 min/week (16). Despite the 
common perception that people with ADHD are sufficiently active or 
even hyperactive, they may not engage in optimal movement 
behaviors for health (17).
Collectively, preliminary findings supported that adults with 
ADHD may experience sleep disturbs suffering from both the disease 
and stimulant medications. However, it was not well-characterized 
whether PA would still be effective in this situation. It remained 
doubtful that what is the relationship between PA and sleep in the 
adult ADHD patients with stimulant medication use group. To our 
knowledge, no public studies have examined the impact of PA on sleep 
in adult ADHD stimulant users. Therefore, we  believe this is an 
important clinical question worthy of further study for this ‘special 
group’. In this study, by using a general sample from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the US, 
we sought to examine the association between PA and sleep in the 
adult ADHD patients with stimulant medication use group and 
quantify the form of this association.
Methods
Study design and sample
The current study’s data came from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which was a nationally 
representative complex, stratified, and multistage probability sample 
of adults and children in the United States. The survey is distinctive in 
that it combines interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory 
testing conducted in participants’ homes and in a traveling mobile 
examination center (MEC). NHANES conducts laboratory tests such 
as blood tests, urine tests, nutritional assessments, and evaluations for 
environmental exposures. NHANES data are freely accessible on the 
website1 for researchers worldwide. The National Center for Health 
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
Institutional Review Board approved the protocol for the original 
NHANES data collection, and informed consent was acquired from 
all individual participants.2
The sample with adults over 20 years old included in three cycles 
(2013–2014, 2015–2016, and 2017-March 2020 prepandemic) of 
NHANES were chosen for data analysis because they included 
information about demographics, anthropometrics, prescription 
medicine use, sleep, physical activity and other covariates used in 
this study.

Measurements
Stimulant medicine use and diagnosis of ADHD
Data on medication use were collected through a medication 
questionnaire conducted by trained interviewers using the Computer-
Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system. Participants were asked 
whether they had taken any prescription medications during the 
month preceding the interview date. Specific questions included 
“Have you used or taken medication that requires a prescription in the 
last 30 days? Do not add any prescription vitamins or minerals that 
you may have already mentioned to me.” In addition, participants 
were asked to provide the generic name of the drug, how long they 
had been taking it, their main reason for taking it, and any ICD-10-CM 
(International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical 
Modification) codes related to their reported reasons for use. Data 
were periodically examined for discrepancies and incorrect entries for 
quality assurance and control. The interviewer’s list of drugs was 
compared to the medication names selected from the drug database. 
Stimulants in this study were defined as methylphenidate, 
amphetamine, 
dexmethylphenidate, 
dextroamphetamine, 
lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, and levoamphetamine. Based on 
stimulant medication use and ICD-10-CM codes, participants with 
ADHD using stimulant medications were identified.
Assessment of sleep parameters
The sleep parameters were derived from the “sleep disorders” 
dataset comprising questions on sleep habits and disorders in the 
“NHANES Questionnaire.” Sleep duration was recorded by answering 
the question “The number of hours that you  typically sleep on 
weekdays or workdays,” and hours were rounded to the closest half-
hour (18). Sleep duration was categorized as short (<7 h per night), 
normal (7–9 h per night) and long (>9 h per night) (19, 20). The 
answer to the question “Have you ever mentioned your difficulty 
sleeping to a doctor or other health care provider?” was used to assess 
trouble sleeping. As shown in Table  1, healthy sleep scores and 
patterns were established using sleep characteristics such as sleep 
duration, trouble sleeping, snoring, snorting or stopping breathing, 
and feeling excessively sleepy during the day. Sleep total scores of 0–1, 
2–3, and 4–5 indicated poor, intermediate, or healthy sleep patterns, 
respectively (21).
Physical activity
The Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) was used to 
evaluate physical activity. The questionnaire consisted of 6 questions 
pertaining to leisure time physical activity, which were administered 
as part of the home interview. Participants were asked if they regularly 
participated in PA by the following questions: (1) “In a typical week, 
do you  do any vigorous-intensity sports, fitness, or recreational 
activities that cause large increases in breathing or heart rate, such as 
running or basketball for at least 10 min continuously?” and (2) “Do 
you engage in any moderate-intensity sports, fitness, or recreational 
activities such as brisk walking, bicycling, swimming, or volleyball for 
at least 10 min continuously during a typical week?” Those who 
responded “yes” to either question were subsequently queried 
regarding the number of days and amount of time spent in each 
activity intensity during a typical week. If a participant completed 
150 min per week of moderate-intensity physical activity (MPA), 
75 min per week of vigorous-intensity physical activity (VPA), or a 
combination of MPA and VPA that amounted to 150 min per week 
(with 1 min of VPA weighted as double that of MPA), they were 
deemed to have met the physical activity guideline and defined as the 
active group. On the contrary, participants were defined as the inactive 
group. This guideline was based on US national physical activity 
recommendations (22, 23).
Covariates
The study’s demographic covariates of interest included age 
(20–29 years, 30–44 years, 45–59 years, and ≥ 60 years), sex (female 
and male), race (Mexican American, Other Hispanic, Non-Hispanic 
White, Non-Hispanic Black, and Other), education level (high school 
or below and above high school), marital status (married/living with 
partner, widowed/divorced/separated, and never married), and 
income. Income was measured using the poverty-income ratio (PIR), 
which is the ratio of household income to the appropriate poverty 
threshold for household size (24). PIR was categorized as <2 (poor or 
near poor) and ≥ 2 (middle to high income) (25). Body mass index 
(BMI) was collected by physical examinations in the Mobile 
Examination Center, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by 
height in meters squared (kg/m2), and classified into <25, 25–30, 
and > 30 kg/m2 categories. Smoking status was determined by the 
question “Have you ever smoked more than 100 cigarettes in your 
life?” and classified as ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Daily alcohol intake was assessed 
from the total nutritional intake (DR1TOT) consumed for the 24 h 
before the interview, which was then separated into two categories: 0 
and > 0 gm. Diabetes and hypertension were identified based on self-
reported and medical diagnoses. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
(PHQ-9) was used to assess the frequency of depressive symptoms

over the previous 2 weeks in the NHANES. It is a nine-item depression 
screening tool with acceptable reliability and validity (26). Response 
categories for each item were scored on a 0–3 scale (0 = “not at all,” 
1 = “several days,” 2 = “more than half the days,” and 3 = “nearly every 
day”), and the total PHQ-9 score ranged from 0 to 27, with higher 
PHQ-9 scores indicating a higher probability of severe depression. A 
total score of ≥10, according to the DSM-IV, was considered clinically 
relevant depression (26).
Statistical analysis
Participants were divided into two groups as active and inactive 
groups. Continuous variables, such as age and BMI, were translated 
into categorical variables. Baseline data were analyzed using the 
chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test and expressed as the number 
(percentage). The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(95% CIs) were calculated using a weighted logistic regression model 
with adjustment for covariates among baseline characteristics and 
stratified by gender to examine the associations between physical 
activity level and sleep in adult ADHD participants with stimulant use. 
We used a restricted cubic spline model to relax the linear relationship 
assumptions and investigate the associations between risk of trouble 
sleeping and time of moderate to vigorous PA (with 1 min of VPA 
weighted as double that of MPA) per week. The reference category for 
this analysis was without moderate to vigorous PA every week. R 
software, version 4.2.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing), 
was used to execute every statistical analysis. p values less than 0.05 
(p < 0.05) indicated statistically significant differences.
Results
The baseline characteristics of the study 
population
A total of 162 eligible ADHD participants who reported stimulant 
use (53.1% males and 46.9% females, mean (SD) age 39.1 [14.4] years) 
were included in this analysis. The characteristics of the participants 
according to physical activity level were presented in Table 2. There 
were no significant differences in sex, race, household income, 
smoking, diabetes, depressive symptoms and duration of stimulant 
use between two groups in the analytic sample. However, age 
distribution of the active group differed from inactive group, with the 
active group being younger. Compared to inactive group, the active 
group were more likely to be highly educated, never married, low 
obesity rate, alcohol intake, and had a lower prevalence of 
hypertension. Furthermore, there were significant differences in 
prevalence of trouble sleeping (p = 0.004) between two groups and no 
significant differences were found in sleep duration and sleep patterns.

guidelines in the US. Patients who met the recommended 150 min/
week of moderate to vigorous physical activity had a significantly 
lower risk of complaining of trouble sleeping (OR: 0.26, 95% CI: 
0.10–0.67, p = 0.006). However, no significant differences were 
observed in sleep duration (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.24–1.52, p = 0.295) 
or sleep patterns (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.12–4.74, p = 0.727). 
Additionally, men who met physical activity guidelines reported 
lower risk of complaining of trouble sleeping (OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 
0.09–0.56, p = 0.002) than men did not meet guidelines. However, 
no significant difference was observed between women (OR: 0.71, 
95% CI: 0.27–1.88, p = 0.500). The results were presented in Table 3. 
In Figure 1, we used restricted cubic splines to flexibly model and 
visualize the relation of predicting the risk of complaining of 
trouble sleeping and time of moderate to vigorous PA per week in 
adults with ADHD who were receiving stimulant medicines. The 
plot showed a slight increase in the risk below 105 min/week (OR: 
1.02, 95% CI: 0.92–1.14) that was not statistically significant and 
then started to decrease rapidly afterward (P for nonlinearity 
=0.025), with a substantial reduction in the risk approximately 
341 min (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76–0.99) until approximately 
1,250 min/week (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.46–0.79), beyond which the 
curve leveled.
Discussion
The present study presented a national sample of adults with 
ADHD who were using stimulant medicines to evaluate the 
relationship between physical activity and sleep. The motivation for 
this study was our previous work on this topic among children, but to 
date, this specific question has not been evaluated extensively in the 
adult population. Adults with ADHD using stimulant medicines are 
an especially vulnerable group that are frequently ignored and suffer 
from both ADHD and stimulants. It was not well-characterized 
whether physical activity would still be effective in this situation. The 
results of this study showed that adult ADHD patients on stimulant 
medications who met the general recommendation of physical activity 
guidelines (150 min/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity) 
in the US had a significantly lower risk of complaining of trouble 
sleeping. Additionally, a nonlinear dose–response relationship was 
found between physical activity and trouble sleeping, and a significant 
reduction in the risk of trouble sleeping was seen within the lower 
range until 341 min.
Adults frequently experience sleep issues, and the prevalence 
of insomnia disorder in adults is approximately 10–20%, with 
approximately 50% having a chronic course (27). The relationship 
between sleep disorders and ADHD is complex, with sleep 
disorders being both co-occurring conditions and consequences of 
ADHD. Despite the use of medication and comorbidities, there is 
abundant evidence that adults with ADHD are more prone to sleep 
problems, indicating that sleep deficits are intrinsic to 
ADHD. Adult ADHD is associated with longer objectively 
measured sleep onset latency, disrupted sleep maintenance, and 
later waking times. Adult ADHD patients with sleep onset 
problems may complain of daytime tiredness, which is related to a 
larger incidence of inattention symptoms (14, 28). Although the 
nature of the connection between ADHD and sleep problems is not 
fully known, inattention and impulsivity can be caused by sleep 
disturbances in the general population, suggesting that disturbed 
sleep may exacerbate ADHD symptoms (29). Conversely, extending 
sleep benefits to patients with ADHD in terms of attentional and 
behavioral functioning, emphasizing the importance of sleep as a 
target for intervention in this population (30), which should 
be  given due weight. Clinically, psychostimulant drugs are 
commonly used for treating the core symptoms of ADHD by 
boosting dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitters in the 
brain. Numerous randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses 
have thoroughly demonstrated the effectiveness of these drugs 
(31–33). The therapeutic effects of stimulants are most likely 
related to the enhancement of central nervous system activity,

particularly in brain regions that are critical for higher-order 
cognitive activities, such as the prefrontal cortex. However, many 
studies point out that stimulants do not improve and may even 
aggravate sleep problems in adults with ADHD (13, 14). This could 
be ascribed to the side effects of stimulants, which depend on the 
specific drug used, dosages, and individual characteristics of the 
patient. It is critical to realize that stimulant drugs should be used 
with other management strategies, such as habit modification or 
anxiety reduction, to counteract the negative effects on sleep.
According to the most recent research, which was published 
in 2023, adhering to the 24-h movement behavior guidelines, 
which call for getting enough sleep, doing at least 60 min of 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day, and limiting 
recreational screen time to no more than 2 h per day was linked to 
a lower risk of cognitive and social difficulties in children and 
adolescents with ADHD (34). This study highlights the importance 
of physical activity, which appears to have a positive impact on 
social and neurocognitive function in children and adults. Clinical 
trials of children with ADHD and preclinical studies on 
spontaneously hypertensive rats, an animal model of ADHD, have 
shown that aerobic exercise can be helpful as an adjunct treatment 
to medication for ADHD. Some studies have also indicated that 
physical activity can be a helpful tool in treating sleep-related 
problems in children with ADHD (35), and aerobic exercise may 
act on catecholamine pathways as a stimulant medication (36). 
Physical activity can effectively shorten the time it takes to fall 
asleep, increase total sleep time, and improve sleep quality for 
many people. Nevertheless, no controlled clinical trials in adults 
with ADHD have been conducted on the efficacy of physical 
activity for improving sleep in adults with ADHD; we performed 
a cross-sectional analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of PA for 
improving sleep among stimulant users of ADHD. Our results 
suggest that greater amounts of weekly moderate-to-vigorous 
activity result in a lower risk of trouble sleeping, indicating that 
maintaining a certain amount of PA is a protective factor to sleep 
for adult ADHD with stimulant medication use. This highlights 
the importance of physical activity in adhering to healthy lifestyle 
behaviors. Activity duration is a significant parameter in exercise 
intervention trials. In this study, it was proven that the 
accumulation of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity within a 
week for a certain period of time had a positive effect on sleep, as 
recommended by the guidelines, but we found that a large number 
of people spent much more than 150 min among the included 
adult ADHD participants, and the significant effect could 
be attributed to this.
It was worth mentioning that there was a significant difference 
in men, but was not significant in women. Possible explanations 
for this discrepancy were likely physiological differences and 
hormonal levels (37, 38). There are physiological differences 
between men and women, including differences in sleep structure 
and regulatory mechanisms. These differences may contribute to 
a greater positive response to physical activity in men, while 
women may exhibit a lesser response to physical activity. In 
addition, women experience hormonal fluctuations during 
different physiological cycles, such as the menstrual cycle and 
menopause. These hormonal changes may influence women’ 
response to physical activity and the effectiveness of improving 
their sleep quality. In a detailed dose–response plot, we found that 
it takes at least 341 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity 
per week to have a significant positive impact on sleep. The results

may be used by researchers and clinicians to develop intervention 
models for individuals with ADHD that focus on the mediating 
functions of lifestyle factors to enhance sleep quality (39). 
Moreover, a dose–response plot portrayed an initial surge in the 
risk of trouble sleeping (0–105 min of physical activity), and it 
would be beneficial for elaborating on it. When individuals engage 
in limited or irregular physical activity, their bodies may require 
adaptation to the new physical demands (40). This adaptive 
process involves physiological adjustments and repairs, which can 
momentarily disrupt sleep quality (40). However, this 
phenomenon is usually temporary, and sleep quality typically 
improves once the body successfully adapts and adjusts to the new 
physical activity load. As such, it is crucial to establish a consistent 
physical activity regimen and allocate adequate time for the body 
to acclimate to the novel physical demands. However, these 
findings require confirmation through longitudinal and 
interventional studies with large sample sizes because there are 
few controlled clinical trials on sleep problems in people with 
ADHD. Additionally, more clinical study is also needed on the 
clinical impact of exercise on sleep problems in adults with ADHD 
to explore potential shared neurobiological mechanisms.
Our study is significant because it provides clear evidence of 
an association between sleep and physical activity in adults with 
ADHD on stimulant medication population. Nevertheless, 
we must acknowledge several shortcomings and limitations in our 
study. Firstly, although this article represented one of the first 
attempts to investigate the role of physical activity with the 
associations of sleep among adults with ADHD on stimulant 
medications population, we cannot rule out that some stimulant 
medications may have positive effects on sleep as various forms of 
stimulants were used in the current study. Moreover, it was a 
cross-sectional study and we cannot prove causality or determine 
whether our findings were due to direct effects of physical activity 
on sleep. In order to expand on the findings, future studies need 
to consider these. Secondly, research on sleep in adults with 
ADHD has recently focused on the role of circadian rhythm and 
circadian preference (chronotype), and this study did not provide 
that relevant information, and these outcomes deserve further 
exploration through sleep monitoring devices in clinical trials. 
Thirdly, data on sleep and physical activity were subjectively self-
reported, which could be improved in future studies by using 
objective measures such as polysomnography and actigraphy.
Conclusion
Our findings from the NHANES revealed associations and a 
dose-effect relationship between physical activity and sleep 
condition in the adult ADHD patients who were using stimulant 
medications, 
and 
strategies 
to 
optimize 
sleep 
should 
be  recommended for adults with ADHD using stimulants, 
including increasing physical activity as a healthy lifestyle choice. 
Gender difference should be considered as an important factor for 
further studies to examine these associations and explore potential 
mechanisms. It is important to confirm our findings through 
additional longitudinal and interventional studies to explore the 
effect of various exercises on sleep quality in populations with adult 
ADHD who are taking stimulants.
