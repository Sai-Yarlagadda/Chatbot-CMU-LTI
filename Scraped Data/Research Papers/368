Previous studies on English natives have shown that encountering an English 
cataphoric pronoun triggers an active search for its antecedent and this searching 
process is modulated by syntactic constraints. It remains unknown whether 
the conclusion is universal to EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners, 
particularly those with distinct L1 like Chinese in linguistic typology. Therefore, 
this study used two eye-tracking experiments to investigate how Chinese EFL 
learners resolve English cataphora. The experiments adopted the gender-
mismatch paradigm. Experiment 1 investigated whether Chinese EFL learners 
with different proficiency would adopt the similar processing pattern to English 
natives and found that gender congruency elicited longer reading times than 
gender incongruency between the first potential antecedent and the cataphoric 
pronoun, the effect early observed in high-proficiency relative to low-proficiency 
learners. Experiment 2 explored whether the cataphora resolution process was 
modulated by Binding Principle B and revealed that longer first fixation durations 
and first pass reading times were observed in gender-mismatch than in gender-
match conditions no matter the antecedents are binding-accessible or not 
while longer regression path durations occurred in gender-mismatch than in 
gender-match conditions only as the antecedents are binding-accessible. Taken 
together, these results indicate that Chinese EFL learners also adopt an active 
search mechanism to resolve cataphoric pronouns, yet along a processing path 
distinct from English natives’. Specifically, Chinese EFL learners predictively link a 
cataphoric pronoun to the first potential antecedent in the sentence but only a 
gender-matching antecedent can prompt them to engage in deep processing of 
the antecedent. Moreover, the processing time varies with the learners’ English 
proficiency. Furthermore, unlike native English speakers’ early application of 
syntactic constraints in their cataphora resolution, Chinese EFL learners try to 
establish co-reference relations between cataphoric pronouns and antecedents 
regardless of following or flouting Binding Principle B in early processing stages 
whereas they exclusively link the cataphoric pronouns to the binding-accessible 
antecedents in late processing stages. This study adds evidence to the Shallow 
Structure Hypothesis whereby L2 learners resort to lexical prior to syntactic cues 
to process sentences in general, which is just opposite to the fashion adopted by 
the natives.

1. Introduction
Cohesive devices abound in human language. Of all the cohesive 
devices, anaphora is used in English more often than not. Anaphora 
refers to the linguistic phenomenon whereby the interpretation of one 
linguistic element (anaphor) depends on the interpretation of another 
(antecedent) (Huang, 2000; Kazanina, 2005). Based on the linear 
position between the two linguistic elements, anaphora is classified 
into two types: forwards anaphora where the forwards anaphor 
appears after its antecedent and backwards anaphora (also referred to 
as cataphora) where the backwards anaphor (cataphor) appears before 
its antecedent. The process of finding the antecedent for an anaphor is 
called anaphora resolution (Mitkov, 2002). Anaphora resolution has 
been a central topic in the field of psycholinguistics for the last few 
decades (e.g., Felser et al., 2009; Felser and Cunnings, 2012; Chow 
et al., 2014; Cunnings et al., 2014; Wu, 2016, 2017; Cunnings et al., 
2017; Yu and Zhai, 2017; Liang et al., 2018; Yu and Dong, 2019; Liu, 
2020; Tang and Wen, 2020), for the correct interpretation of anaphors 
underlies successful sentence comprehension. Though both being the 
commonly used cohesive devices in English, backwards anaphora has 
received much less attention than forwards anaphora in empirical 
studies. To date, the majority of cataphora resolution studies have been 
conducted on native speakers (Kazanina et al., 2007; Kazanina and 
Phillips, 2010; Clackson and Clahsen, 2011; Yoshida et  al., 2014; 
Pablos et al., 2015; Patterson and Felser, 2019; Kush and Dillon, 2021) 
while few on L2 learners (Rodríguez, 2008; Bertenshaw, 2009; 
Drummer and Felser, 2018; Wu et  al., 2019). Although the EFL 
learners in the L2 cataphora resolution studies exhibited similar 
processing patterns as English natives, they basically have a L1 similar 
to English in linguistic typology. As a consequence, it remains 
unknown how English learners with a typologically distinct L1 resolve 
English cataphora. Since Chinese as a semantics-driven language 
contrasts with English as a syntax-driven language, an examination is 
required to test whether this typological difference influences Chinese 
EFL learners’ online processing of English cataphoric pronouns. 
Against this background, the current study aims to investigate Chinese 
EFL learners’ online processing of English cataphoric pronouns.
Previous cataphora resolution studies on native speakers have shown 
that encountering a cataphoric pronoun triggers an active search for its 
antecedent (Cowart and Cairns, 1987; van Gompel and Liversedge, 2003; 
Filik and Sanford, 2008). In van Gompel and Liversedge’s (2003) 
eye-tracking study, the gender-mismatch paradigm was adopted for the 
first time to test whether the use of morphological information preceded 
the computation of coreference relations during pronoun resolution. 
They used materials like those in (1), in which the gender of the first 
noun phrase in the main clause was manipulated to either match or 
mismatch the cataphoric pronoun in the subordinate clause.
 (1) a. gender-match
When he was at the party, the boy cruelly teased the girl during the 
party games.
b. gender-mismatch.
When he was at the party, the girl cruelly teased the boy during 
the party games.
Their results showed that English native speakers exhibited longer 
reading times in gender-mismatch than gender-match conditions at 
the adverb region immediately following the first noun phrase. This 
suggested that English native speakers predictively assigned the 
cataphoric pronoun to the first noun phrase, and the gender-
incongruency between the cataphoric pronoun and the first noun 
phrase caused reader’s processing difficulty. This processing difficulty 
was thus referred to as GMME effect (Gender-Mismatch effect). The 
presence of GMME effect indicated that readers were so eager to 
resolve the cataphoric pronoun that they predictively linked the 
cataphoric pronoun to the first syntactic position that could contain a 
potential antecedent even before the gender information of the 
potential antecedent became available. This searching process in 
cataphora resolution is much like the active search mechanism 
adopted in processing filler-gap dependencies (e.g., Crain and Fodor, 
1985; Stowe, 1986; Frazier and Flores D’Arcais, 1989), for both parsers 
attempt to find an antecedent or gap at the earliest possible syntactic 
position in order to establish the dependencies as soon as possible, 
without considering the plausibility of the constituent at that position 
(Kazanina et al., 2007). On this basis, active search mechanism is also 
used to describe the process of actively searching for antecedents in 
cataphora resolution.
English native speakers initiate an active search for the antecedent 
after encountering a cataphoric pronoun. This finding gave rise to 
another research question, i.e., whether the search process in 
cataphora resolution proceeds unconstrained or is subject to some 
constraints. The Binding Theory proposed by Chomsky (1981) offers 
theoretical justification for the interpretation of pronouns. Of the 
three principles contained in the Binding Theory, what is relevant to 
the interpretation of cataphoric pronouns is Principle C whereby 
referring expressions cannot co-refer with noun phrases including 
pronouns that c-command them. In the context of cataphora, 
Principle C can be restated as cataphoric pronouns cannot establish 
coreference relations with noun phrases that are c-commanded by 
them. Naturally, Principle C is able to be used to test whether the 
active searching process in cataphora resolution is restricted by the 
syntactic constraint.
Kazanina et al. (2007) were the first to demonstrate that Principle 
C constrained English natives’ online processing of cataphoric 
pronouns. Results from Kazanina et al.’s (2007) study showed that 
significantly longer reading times in gender-mismatch than in gender-
match conditions were only observed in no-constraint pairs. This 
suggested that English native speakers only tried to establish 
coreference relations between the cataphoric pronoun and the first 
potential antecedent in the no-constraint conditions, indicating that 
Principle C indeed constrained English native speakers’ online 
processing of cataphoric pronouns Later, Principle C’s constraint in 
Wang et al.

cataphora resolution was also confirmed by other studies (Kazanina 
and Phillips, 2010; Clackson and Clahsen, 2011; Yoshida et al., 2014; 
Pablos et al., 2015).
The active searching for the antecedent in cataphora resolution 
was restricted not only by Principle C, but also by Principle B, the 
principle that regulates co-arguments of the same predicate cannot 
establish coreference relations. For instance, Kush and Dillon (2021) 
employed self-paced reading technique to test whether Principle B 
constrained English native speakers’ cataphora resolution.
 (2) a. Constraint, gender-match/gender-mismatch
While (PRO) driving him/her to school on Friday, Christopher 
casually told Juan/Hannah that he would pick up everyone early for 
a surprise.
b. No-constraint, gender-match/gender-mismatch.
While (PRO) driving his/her daughter to school on Friday, 
Christopher casually told Juan/Hannah that he  would pick up 
everyone early for a surprise.
They designed cataphoric pronouns to appear in a fronted 
participle clause, with its implicit subject obligatorily interpreted as 
the matrix subject according to Control Theory (Chomsky, 1981), 
consequently making the coreference between the cataphoric pronoun 
and the matrix subject syntactically-illicit, as illustrated in (2a). In 
(2b), by contrast, with the cataphoric pronoun being embedded inside 
the noun phrase his/her daughter, the implicit subject PRO and the 
cataphoric pronoun were no longer co-arguments of the same 
predicate, which allowed for coreference between PRO and the 
cataphoric pronoun, and further made the coreference between the 
cataphoric pronoun and matrix subject syntactically-licit. Kush and 
Dillon (2021)’s results showed that the GMME effect at the matrix 
subject region (Christopher) and its spillover region (casually) was 
only present in the no-constraint conditions, demonstrating that 
Principle B restricted English native speakers’ active searching for the 
cataphor antecedent.
In summary, cataphora resolution studies on native speakers have 
consistently shown that encountering a cataphoric pronoun triggers 
an active search for the antecedent and this searching process is 
restricted by syntactic constraints (Principle B and Principle C) such 
that only syntactically-licit noun phrases can be  considered as 
antecedents of cataphoric pronouns.
Compared to cataphora resolution studies on native speakers, very 
little research has been conducted to investigate how L2 learners 
resolve cataphoric pronouns (Rodríguez, 2008; Bertenshaw, 2009; 
Drummer and Felser, 2018; Wu et  al., 2019). Using eye-tracking 
technique, Drummer and Felser (2018) compared the online 
performance of German native speakers and Russian German learners 
in processing German cataphoric pronouns, revealing that Russian 
German learners behaved themselves just as German native speakers 
in using an active search mechanism that was constrained by Principle 
C. Similarly, Bertenshaw (2009) found that both English native 
speakers and Japanese English learners followed Principle C when 
resolving cataphoric pronouns online. Another comparative study 
using self-paced reading technique indicated that both English native 
speakers and Spanish English learners abided by Principle C in 
processing English cataphoric pronouns while the GMME effect 
restricted to no-constraint conditions did not reach statistical 
significance in Chinese English learners (Rodríguez, 2008). Wu et al. 
(2019), who adopted self-paced reading technique to compare 
Chinese EFL learners’ processing of forwards anaphora and cataphora, 
found that the GMME effect was not statistically significant in their 
processing of cataphoric pronouns.
Evidently, previous cataphora resolution studies on English 
native speakers have consistently shown that native speakers initiate 
an active search for the cataphor antecedent, in accordance with 
Principle B and C. Though a few studies on EFL learners revealed 
similar results, the learners have L1s basically similar to English in 
linguistic typology. It remains unknown how EFL learners with 
typologically distinct L1s like Chinese resolve English cataphora. 
Whether there exists cataphora in Chinese has been a controversial 
issue. Some scholars (Xu and He, 2007; Gao, 2010; Yu, 2011) hold 
that zero pronouns in the preposed (clause-initial) modifiers can 
form cataphoric relations with noun phrases which act as the main 
clause subjects or the modifiers of the main clause subjects. For 
example, Gao (2010) used the following sentences in (3) to 
exemplify his view that zero cataphoric pronouns exist in both 
Chinese and English and they are used in a similar way in the two 
languages. However, other scholars (Wang, 1994; Wang, 2000, 2006; 
Zhao and Shao, 2002) believes that third person pronouns in 
Chinese do not have the cataphoric function, as can be seen in (4). 
Combining the two views together, we  can conclude that zero 
cataphoric pronouns are present in both Chinese and English while 
overt cataphoric pronouns exist only in English. Since there are no 
overt cataphoric pronouns in Chinese, it is more informative to 
investigate Chinese EFL learners’ online processing of English overt 
cataphoric pronouns.

Against the above-mentioned background, the current study was 
undertaken to explore how Chinese EFL learners resolve English 
cataphoric pronouns by two eye-tracking experiments. Unlike 
previous studies on cataphora resolution, we referred to Kush and 
Dillon (2021) to test whether Principle B would affect Chinese EFL 
learners’ online processing of cataphoric pronouns. This option arises 
from the theoretical assumption by which Principle B is more suitable 
than Principle C for testing the role of syntactic constraint in cataphora 
resolution, for the application of Principle C in cataphora resolution 
involves some semantic and pragmatic considerations (Reinhart, 
1983; Levinson, 1991; Reinhart and Reuland, 1993; Huang, 1994; 
Huang, 2000; Büring, 2005) while the application of Principle B is 
purely syntactic. In addition, considering learners’ proficiency level 
plays an important role in L2 sentence processing, we included two 
groups of Chinese EFL learners (high-proficiency group and 
low-proficiency group, HG and LG henceforth), to explore how 
learners’ proficiency level might modulate their online processing of 
cataphoric pronouns.
Specifically, this study was conducted to investigate whether 
Chinese EFL learners with different proficiency levels would adopt the 
pattern (i.e., an active search mechanism) similar to English natives in 
English cataphora resolution and whether the cataphora processing 
would be modulated by Principle B. In association with previous 
Wang et al. 
10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1126673
Frontiers in Psychology

studies, we made the following hypotheses corresponding to the two 
research questions.
Firstly, both HG and LG learners would adopt an active search 
mechanism like English natives when resolving cataphoric pronouns, 
as would be indicated by longer reading times at the critical word 
region or its spillover region in gender-mismatching than in gender-
matching sentences (i.e., GMME effect). Besides, learners’ English 
proficiency discrepancy might modulate the processing time-course, 
i.e., HG learners could be earlier than LG learners in initiating the 
search mechanism, as would be indicated by the GMME effect being 
observed in both early and late eye-movement measures at the critical 
word region and its spillover region for HG learners while the GMME 
effect being found in only late eye-movement measures at the critical 
word region or its spillover region for LG learners.
Secondly, Chinese EFL learners would observe Principle B in 
processing English cataphora, as would be suggested by a GMME 
effect restricted to no-constraint sentences at the critical word region 
or its spillover region. Furthermore, the processing pattern might vary 
with the learners’ English proficiency as well. Specifically, HG learners 
might behave more like English natives, exhibiting early application 
of Principle B in cataphora resolution, as would be indexed by the 
GMME effect restricted to no-constraint sentences being found in 
both early and late eye-movement measures at the critical word region 
and its spillover region, while LG learners would show delayed 
application of Principle B, as would be evidenced by the GMME effect 
restricted to no-constraint sentences being found in only late 
eye-movement measures at the critical word region or its 
spillover region.
2. Experiment 1
Experiment 1 was conducted to explore whether Chinese EFL 
learners would adopt an active search mechanism to resolve cataphoric 
pronouns as English natives do, and how learners’ proficiency would 
modulate this cataphora resolution process.
2.1. Participants
Thirty-one English majors who had passed TEM-8 (Test for 
English Majors-Band 8) and thirty-two non-English majors who had 
scored between 430 and 480 on the CET-4 (College English Test Band 
4) but had not passed the CET-6 (College English Test Band 6) were 
recruited as our participants. Of all the participants, the data of five 
participants (1 English majors and 4 non-English majors) were 
excluded from further analyses as their accuracy rate was below 60%. 
The data to enter into final analysis consisted of 30 English majors 
(age: M = 22 years, SD = 1.11 years, ranging from 20 years to 24 years; 
gender: 10 males, 20 females) and 28 non-English majors (age: 
M =  21 years, SD  =  1.17 years, ranging from 19 years to 23 years; 
gender: 10 males, 18 females). Before the experiment, all the 
participants were required to complete an adapted version of language 
history questionnaire (Li et al., 2006) in which they needed to report 
their AoA (Age of Acquisition) of English and make a self-assessment 
on their English listening, speaking, reading and writing abilities (five 
points for full marks for each ability). Besides, they also needed to 
complete the Oxford Placement Test (QPT), a standardized test for 
English proficiency. Results of the questionnaire and QPT scores are 
given in Table 1.
English majors (M = 53.10, SD = 1.77) scored significantly higher 
than non-English majors (M = 36.18, SD = 1.68) in the QPT (t 
(56) = 37.312, p <  0.001). Two independent-sample t-test on 
participants’ total scores of four English abilities also showed that 
English majors (M = 13.05, SD = 1.86) scored significantly higher than 
non-English majors (M = 10.75, SD = 2.09; t (56) = −4.421, p < 0.001). 
At the same time, the self-rated score on English reading ability was 
positively correlated with the OPT score for both English majors (r 
(28) =0.817, p <  0.001) and non-English majors (r (26) = 0.899, 
p < 0.001). On account of this, we took English majors as HG learners 
and non-English majors as LG learners. Both HG and LG learners are 
late second language learners, with no significant difference in their 
AoA of English (HG: M = 9.75, SD = 1.97; LG: M = 8.88, SD = 2.01; t 
(56) = −1.651, p =  0.104). All participants were right-handed 
(Oldfield, 1971) native Chinese speakers with normal or corrected to 
normal vision and did not have any psychiatric or reading disorders. 
Each participant signed a formal inform consent before the 
experiment and were paid for their participation after the experiment. 
The experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of Qufu 
Normal University.
2.2. Materials
Our stimuli consisted of 50 pairs of sentences as shown in (5). 
Of the 50 pairs of sentences, 24 pairs were adapted from the 
sentences in no-constraint conditions in Kush and Dillon (2021)’s 
Experiment 2, using familiar names and words to substitute for the 
corresponding unfamiliar counterparts, and the other 26 pairs were 
constructed by referring to the sentence structures in Kush and 
Dillon (2021). The 50 pairs of experimental sentences were selected 
from a total of 80 pairs of sentences. Thirty-four LG learners who 
did not participate in the formal experiment but were selected from 
non-English majors based on the same criteria as in formal 
experiment were recruited to rate the comprehensibility of all the 
sentences on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = totally incomprehensible, 
5 = totally comprehensible). As a result, the sentences with over 3.75 
rating score on average were chosen as the experimental stimuli 
(M = 4.33, SD = 0.31) so that all were equally understood by both 
HG and LG learners.

 (5) a. gender-match
After a stranger bought her an iced coffee, Linda generously offered 
Elsa the best seat at the meeting table.
b. gender-mismatch.
After a stranger bought him an iced coffee, Linda generously 
offered Victor the best seat at the meeting table.
As shown in (5), all the stimuli are made up of two parts, the 
subordinate clause (headed by while, before or after) as the first part 
and the main clause as the second part. The cataphoric pronoun 
occurs in the direct object position of the subordinate clause with an 
indefinite noun phrase (e.g., a stranger) or an indefinite pronoun 
(someone, anyone) as the subject. The main clause contains two 
names, one in subject position (followed by an adverb) and the other 
in object position. Adverbs following the matrix subject name were 
those with a weak pragmatic function, such as casually, generously, 
kindly and the like. All the adverbs were selected from the lexical 
syllabus for CET-4 and acquired an average rating score of more than 
3.75 on a 5-ponit Likert scale (M = 4.01, SD = 0.58) in a familiarity 
pretest (1 = totally unfamiliar, 5 = totally familiar) by the same group 
of LG learners who participated in the sentence comprehensibility 
rating. The gender of the cataphoric pronoun was manipulated to 
either match or mismatch the gender of the matrix subject. The gender 
of the matrix object name was designed to match that of the cataphoric 
pronoun so that the pronoun could be resolved intra-sententially. All 
the sentences in gender-match conditions were counterbalanced so 
that the cataphoric pronouns him and her appeared evenly in 
the stimuli.
The experimental sentences were divided into two lists by a Latin-
Square design, with 75 extra sentences as fillers which were similar to 
the target sentences in length and complexity, but did not contain 
cataphoric pronouns. To ensure that participants could attend to the 
reading task, 25 experimental sentences and 38 filler sentences were 
followed by a comprehension question for each. In case participants 
did not resolve cataphoric pronouns during reading, 7 out of the 25 
comprehension questions following the experimental sentences 
required the interpretation of cataphoric pronouns (e.g., Who got an 
iced coffee?) and the remaining questions asked about argument roles 
in the main clause or subordinate clause (Who offered someone the 
best seat?/Who got the best seat?/Who bought someone an 
iced coffee?).
As illustrated in (5), four regions (underlined parts) were selected 
for experimental analyses: Region 1 (e.g., Linda), the main clause 
subject (the first potential antecedent of the cataphoric pronoun); 
Region 2 (e.g., generously), the adverb following the matrix subject, 
serving as the spillover region of Region 1; Region 3 (e.g., Elsa/Victor), 
the direct object in the main clause (the other potential antecedent for 
the cataphoric pronoun); Region 4 (e.g., the best), the spillover region 
of Region 3, containing two words immediately following Region 3.
2.3. Procedure
The whole experiment was carried out in a quiet laboratory room. 
Participants were seated ~75 cm away from the display screen and 
60 cm away from the eye-tracker. The eye-movement data were 
recorded using the desk-mounted Eyelink 1000 plus eye-tracker (SR 
Research, Toronto, ON, Canada) with a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz and 
a refresh rate of 150 Hz. Right eye was recorded. All the experimental 
sentences were displayed in 19-point Consolas font across two lines 
on a 19-inch computer screen.
Each participant was randomly assigned to one of the two 
presentation lists in which sentences were presented in a pseudo-
randomized order such that two sentences in the same condition 
would not appear more than two consecutive times. Before the formal 
experiment, a nine-point calibration procedure was performed, 
followed by a practice session of five sentences for each participant. 
Drift corrections were performed between trials. All participants were 
instructed to read the sentences in a natural speed. After finishing 
reading the sentences, they should press the space key to answer 
questions or move into next trial. Once a question sentence appeared, 
participants should press either “F” or “J” to make a response, with the 
two keys counterbalanced across participants. The whole experiment 
was comprised of two sessions with a short interval in between. The 
whole experiment lasted about 40–50 min for HG learners and 
60–70 min for LG learners.
2.4. Data analysis
Following Drummer and Felser (2018), we  reported four 
eye-movement measures in each of the four regions: First Fixation 
Duration (FFD), First Pass Reading Time (FPRT), Regression Path 
Duration (RPD) and Total Reading Time (TRT).
Before exporting the eye-movement data, fixations that were 
shorter than 80 ms but within one character space of the previous or 
next fixations were merged with their neighboring fixations. The 
remaining fixations that were shorter than 80 ms or longer than 
800 ms were excluded because they could not reflect proper language 
processing (Rayner and Pollatsek, 1989; Rayner, 1998). For each 
eye-movement measure, the data above or below three standard 
deviations were removed from further analyses. For HG learners, this 
accounted for 5.76% of the data in the by-participant analysis and 
6.12% of the data in the by-item analysis. For LG learners, this 
accounted for 4.91% of the data in the by-participant analysis and 
4.57% of data in the by-item analysis.
Two-way mixed repeated measures ANOVAs with participants 
(F1) and items (F2) as random variables were carried out for each 
eye-movement measure with between-subject factor Group (HG vs. 
LG) and within-subject factor Gender Match (yes vs. no) using SPSS 
Statistics 26.0. Table 2 displays two participant groups’ mean reading 
times on the four regions per condition and Table  3 provides a 
summary of ANOVAs for each region.
2.5. Results
2.5.1. Behavioral data
The mean accuracy was 81.38% (SD = 0.10) for HG learners and 
71.38% (SD = 0.09) for LG learners, which were both significantly 
above the chance level (HG: t (29) = 17.960, p <  0.001; LG: t 
(27) = 12.475, p <  0.001), showing that all the participants were 
attentive to the reading task.
2.5.2. Eye-tracking data
The following is the statistical results of the eye-tracking data in 
association with each region. By convention, only the significant

results are reported as below. All significant and non-significant 
results may be seen at Table 3.
2.5.2.1. Region 1
For first fixation durations, no significant main effects or 
interactions were found (ps > 0.1).
For first pass reading times, a significant interaction between 
Gender Match and Group was found (p1 = 0.001; p2 = 0.003). Simple 
effects analysis revealed that only HG learners spent significantly 
longer reading times in gender-match than in gender-mismatch 
conditions (F1(1, 56) = 10.039, p = 0.002; F2(1, 98) = 7.025, p = 0.009).
For regression path durations, a marginally significant interaction 
between Gender Match and Group in the participant analysis was 
observed (p1 = 0.068; p2 = 0.137). Simple effects analysis showed that 
only HG learners exhibited significantly longer regression path 
durations in gender-match than in gender-mismatch conditions 
(F1(1, 56) = 4.239, p = 0.044; F2(1, 98) = 3.209, p = 0.076).
For total reading times, a significant interaction between Gender 
Match and Group was found (p1 = 0.003; p2 = 0.005). Simple effects 
analysis showed that only HG learners demonstrated significantly 
longer total reading times in gender-match than in gender-mismatch 
conditions (F1(1, 56) = 8.926, p = 0.004; F2(1, 98) = 6.428, p = 0.013).
2.5.2.2. Region 2
For first fixation durations, no significant main effects or 
interactions were found (ps > 0.1).
For first pass reading times, a marginally significant interaction 
between Gender Match and Group in the participant analysis was 
observed (p1 = 0.061; p2 = 0.224). Simple effects analysis showed that 
only HG learners spent longer reading times in gender-match than in 
gender-mismatch conditions (F1(1, 56) = 4.954, p =  0.030; F2(1, 
98) = 2.152, p = 0.146).
For regression path durations, no significant main effects or 
interactions were found (ps > 0.1).

For total reading times, a significant main effect of Gender Match 
in the participant analysis was observed (p1 = 0.038; p2 = 0.063). Both 
HG and LG learners spent significantly longer reading times in 
gender-match than in gender-mismatch conditions.
2.5.2.3. Region 3
For first fixation durations, a marginally significant interaction 
between Gender Match and Group in the participant analysis was 
found (p1 = 0.065; p2 = 0.127). Simple effects analysis showed that only 
in gender-mismatch conditions, did LG learners exhibit longer first 
fixation durations than HG learners (F1(1, 56) = 8.237, p = 0.006; F2(1, 
98) = 21.842, p < 0.001). Meanwhile, HG learners spent longer first 
fixation durations in gender-match than in gender-mismatch 
conditions (F1(1, 56) = 5.517, p = 0.022; F2(1, 98) = 4.423, p = 0.038).
For first pass reading times, a significant main effect of Gender 
Match was found (p1 = 0.006; p2 = 0.030). First pass reading times in 
gender-match conditions were significantly longer than those in 
gender-mismatch conditions for both HG learners and LG learners.
For regression path durations, a significant main effect of Gender 
Match was found (p1 = 0.001; p2 = 0.004). Both HG and LG learners 
showed significantly longer reading times in gender-match than in 
gender-mismatch conditions.
For total reading times, a significant main effect of Gender Match 
was observed (p1 < 0.001; p2 < 0.001). Both HG and LG learners spent 
significantly longer reading times in gender-match than in gender-
mismatch conditions.
2.5.2.4. Region 4
For all eye-movement measures (first fixation durations, first pass 
reading times, regression path durations, total reading times), no 
significant main effects or interactions were observed at this region 
(ps > 0.05).
2.6. Discussion
Experiment 1 intended to explore whether Chinese EFL learners 
initiated an active searching process in cataphora resolution and 
whether learners’ proficiency level influenced this searching process. 
The eye-movement data revealed a GME effect (Gender Match Effect) 
for all participants, but the effect was observed earlier in HG learners 
than in LG learners.
Contrary to a GMME effect that has been consistently observed 
in previous studies on cataphora resolution (van Gompel and 
Liversedge, 2003; Kazanina et al., 2007; Kazanina and Phillips, 2010; 
Clackson and Clahsen, 2011; Yoshida et al., 2014; Pablos et al., 2015; 
Patterson and Felser, 2019), our study unexpectedly revealed a GME 
effect at region 1 (subject name) and region 2 (adverb), suggesting 
that a gender-matching potential antecedent elicited longer reading 
times than its gender-mismatching counterpart at the matrix subject 
position. GMME effect has been taken as an indication of readers’ 
employment of active search mechanism in cataphora resolution, so 
did the absence of GMME effect mean Chinese EFL learners did not 
resolve the cataphoric pronoun in an active way? It seems hasty to 
jump to such a strong conclusion. Since readers’ active search for the 
cataphor’s antecedent implies a link has already been established 
between the cataphoric pronoun and the first syntactic position that 
could contain a noun phrase even before the information (e.g., 
gender and number) about the noun phrase is accessed, the nature 
of the active search mechanism lies in whether readers predictively 
link a cataphoric pronoun to the first syntactic position that could 
contain a potential antecedent. Based on this rationale, we believe 
that Chinese EFL learners were also engaged in an active search for 
the antecedent in the cataphora resolution process, otherwise the 
gender features of the first potential antecedent would not affect 
their reading times (though in a different direction from English 
natives). However, this active searching process adopted by Chinese 
EFL learners was distinct from the one used by English natives in 
that only a gender-matching antecedent could prompt Chinese EFL 
learners to engage in a deep processing of this antecedent, 
contrasting with English natives’ deep processing of both gender-
matching and gender-mismatching antecedents, consequently 
resulting in GME effect for Chinese EFL learners while GMME effect 
for English natives. As for the reason why Chinese EFL learners 
behaved differently from English native speakers when facing a 
gender-mismatching name at the matrix subject position, we will 
elaborate it in the General Discussion part.
Consistent with our predictions, LG learners were found to 
behave differently from HG learners in the processing of cataphoric 
pronouns. HG learners exhibited a GME effect in first pass reading 
times, regression path durations and total reading times at region 1, 
while LG learners only showed a GME effect in total reading times at 
region 2, i.e., gender features of subject names did not affect LG 
learners’ processing time until region 2 (the spillover region of the 
subject name). This suggests that LG learners, relative to HG learners, 
delayed their active searching process in cataphora resolution.
Significantly longer reading times in gender-match than in 
gender-mismatch conditions were also observed in first pass reading 
times, regression path durations and total reading times at region 3 
(object name region). However, the gender-match effect at region 3 
was different from that at region 1 and region 2. The name at region 3 
provides another antecedent candidate in gender-match conditions 
while it is the only suitable antecedent in gender-mismatch conditions. 
Therefore, the longer reading times observed in gender-match than in 
gender-mismatch conditions might due to the competition between 
two gender-matching names for acting as the antecedent of the 
cataphoric pronoun. In addition, it appeared that HG learners were 
earlier influenced by the competition between subject name and 
object name in gender-match conditions as indicated by longer first 
fixation durations in gender-match conditions observed only for 
HG learners.
In summary, the results of Experiment 1 suggest that Chinese EFL 
learners also adopt an active search mechanism to resolve cataphoric 
pronouns, yet along a processing path distinct from English natives’. 
Specifically, Chinese EFL learners predictively link a cataphoric 
pronoun to the first potential antecedent in the sentence but only a 
gender-matching antecedent can prompt them to engage in deep 
processing of the antecedent. Moreover, the learners’ proficiency level 
modulates the time-course of their active searching process, with HG 
learners initiating an active search for the antecedent earlier than 
LG learners.
Both HG and LG Chinese EFL learners initiate an active search 
for the antecedent after encountering a cataphoric pronoun. Whether 
this searching process is also constrained by Binding Principles in the 
same way as English natives has not been clear, the issue Experiment 
2 was to explore.

3. Experiment 2
Experiment 1 has shown that Chinese EFL learners initiated an 
active search for the cataphor’s antecedent. Experiment 2 was thus 
conducted to further investigate whether Chinese EFL learners’ active 
searching process is governed by the Binding Principle B. If so, we also 
want to explore whether learners’ proficiency influences the time-
course of the application of Binding Principle B.
3.1. Participants
The recruitment criteria for participants were the same as in 
Experiment 1. A total of 27 English majors and 30 non-English 
majors participated in this experiment. The data of three 
participants (all non-English majors) were discarded as their 
accuracy rate was below 60%. The data for final analysis comprised 
of 27 English majors (age: M = 22.17 years, SD = 1.26 years, ranging 
from 20 years to 26 years; gender: 9 males, 18 females) and 27 
non-English majors (age: M = 20.88 years, SD = 1.19 years, ranging 
from 19 years to 23 years; gender: 10 males, 17 females). All 
participants completed an adapted version of language history 
questionnaire (Li et al., 2006) and the QPT before the experiment. 
The results of the language history questionnaire and QPT scores 
are provided in Table 4.
As in Experiment 1, English majors (M = 52.37, SD = 1.52) were 
more proficient than non-English majors (M = 35.81, SD = 1.75; t 
(52) = 37.023, p < 0.001), which was also confirmed by the results from 
participants’ total scores of four English abilities, showing that English 
majors (M = 13.41, SD = 2.02) scored significantly higher than 
non-English majors (M = 11.22, SD = 2.68; t(52) = −3.433, p = 0.001). 
Similarly, self-rated score on English reading ability was positively 
correlated with the OPT score for both English majors (r (25) = 0.749, 
p <  0.001) and non-English majors (r (25) = 0.863, p <  0.001). 
Therefore, we grouped English majors as HG learners and non-English 
majors as LG learners. Both two participant groups were late second 
language learners, with no significant difference in their AoA of 
English (HG: M = 8.80 years, SD = 1.90 years; LG: M = 9.38 years, 
SD = 1.74 years; t (52) =1.146, p = 0.257). All participants signed a 
written inform consent before the experiment and were paid for their 
participation after the experiment.
3.2. Materials
The materials consisted of 60 sets of sentences as shown in (6). 
Each sentence was made up of one main clause and one fronted 
participle clause headed by while, before or after. All the materials 
were constructed following a two-factors (Constraint and Gender-
Match) within-subjects design. The factor Constraint manipulated 
whether the coreference between the cataphoric pronoun and the 
matrix subject was constrained by Binding Principle B. In 
constraint conditions, the cataphor was the direct object of the 
infinitival verb while in no-constraint conditions, the cataphor was 
a possessive pronoun embedded in the direct object noun phrase. 
Across constraint and no-constraint conditions, the gender of the 
cataphoric pronoun was manipulated to either match or mismatch 
the gender of the matrix subject. As in Experiment 1, all the 
adverbs following the matrix subjects were selected from the 
lexical syllabus for CET-4 and met the requirement of an average 
rating score of more than 3.75 on a 5-ponit Likert scale (M = 4.12, 
SD = 0.46) in a familiarity pretest (1 = totally unfamiliar, 5 = totally 
familiar) by an additional group of 60 LG learners who were 
selected from non-English majors based on the same criteria as in 
formal experiment. There was a gender-matching name at the 
matrix object position across four conditions to ensure that each 
cataphoric pronoun was to have an intra-sentential referent.
Of the 60 sets of target sentences, 24 sets were adapted from Kush 
and Dillon (2021)’s Experiment 1 and the other 26 sets were 
constructed following the same sentence patterns. The 60 sets of target 
sentences were selected from a total of 85 sets of sentences. The same 
group of LG learners who participated in the familiarity test on 
adverbs were also asked to rate the comprehensibility of those 
sentences on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = totally incomprehensible, 
5 = totally comprehensible). Sentences with 3.75 rating score on 
average were selected as the experimental items (M = 4.34, SD = 0.28).

b. constraint, gender-mismatch.
After buying him an iced coffee, Linda generously offered Victor

c. no-constraint, gender-match.
After buying her colleague an iced coffee, Linda generously offered 
Elsa the best seat at the meeting table.
d. no-constraint, gender-mismatch.
After buying his colleague an iced coffee, Linda generously offered 
Victor the best seat at the meeting table.
To ensure that each participant would receive a sufficient number 
of target sentences from each condition, the 60 sets of experimental 
sentences were divided into two lists in such a way that each 
participant could see two sentences from one set, one in constraint 
condition, and the other in no-constraint condition. Each list 
consisted of 120 experimental sentences (30 experimental sentences 
for each condition) and mixed with equal 120 fillers. As in 
Experiment 1, the fillers were of similar length and complexity to the 
experimental sentences and did not contain cataphoric pronouns. 
Similarly, half of the experimental sentences and filler sentences were 
followed by a comprehension question. In case participants did not

resolve cataphoric pronouns during reading, 12 out of the 60 
comprehension questions following the experimental sentences 
required the interpretation of cataphoric pronouns (e.g., Who got an 
iced coffee?/Whose colleague got an iced coffee?) and the remaining 
questions mainly targeted the interpretation of argument roles in the 
main clause (e.g., Who offered someone the best seat?/Who got the 
best seat?) or the interpretation of the implicit subject in the adjunct 
clause (e.g., Who bought someone an iced coffee?).
Also similar to Experiment 1, four regions were selected for 
further analyses. Region 1 was the matrix subject name; Region 2 was 
the adverb following the matrix subject; Region 3 was the matrix 
object name; Region 4 consisted of two words that came after 
Region 3.
3.3. Procedure
The procedure was identical to Experiment 1. The formal part of 
the experiment was divided into three blocks with a short break in 
between. After each break, a nine-point calibration procedure was 
conducted again. All the stimuli in each presentation list were 
presented in a pseudo-randomized order such that two sentences in 
the same condition would not consecutively appear more than twice. 
The entire experiment lasted about 70–80 min for HG learners and 
80–90 min for LG learners.
3.4. Data analysis
The same four eye-movement measures were reported as in 
Experiment 1: first fixation duration, first pass reading time, regression 
path duration and total reading time.
Before exporting the eye-movement data, fixations shorter than 
80 ms but within one character space of the previous or next fixations 
were merged with their neighboring fixations. The fixations that were 
shorter than 80 ms or longer than 800 ms were excluded as well. For 
each eye-movement measure, the data that were above or below three 
standard deviations were discarded from further analyses. For HG 
learners, this accounted for 7.90% of data in the by-participant 
analysis and 5.66% of data in the by-item analysis. For LG learners, 
this accounted for 6.14% of the data in the by-participant analysis and 
6.28% of data in the by-item analysis.
Three-way mixed repeated measures ANOVAs with participants 
(F1) and items (F2) as random variables were carried out for each 
eye-movement measure with between-subject factor Group (HG vs. 
LG) and within-subject factors Constraint (yes vs. no) and Gender 
Match (yes vs. no) using SPSS Statistics 26.0. Table 5 displays two 
participant groups’ mean reading times on the four regions per 
condition and Table  6 provides a summary of ANOVAs for 
each region.
3.5. Results
3.5.1. Behavioral data
The mean accuracy was 87.28% (SD = 0.06) for HG learners and 
80.83% (SD = 0.06) for LG learners, which were both significantly 
above the chance level (t(29) = 32.543, p <  0.001; t(23) = 24.147, 
p <  0.001), showing that all the learners completed the reading 
task attentively.
3.5.2. Eye-tracking data
The significant statistical results of eye-tracking measurement are 
reported as below for each region. All significant and non-significant 
results may be seen at Table 6.
3.5.2.1. Region 1

Constraint was found (p1 < 0.001; p2 = 0.001). Matrix subject names 
in constraint conditions required significantly longer first fixations 
than those in no-constraint conditions. A significant interaction 
was observed between Gender Match and Group in the item 
analysis (p1 = 0.108; p2 = 0.044). Simple effects analysis revealed 
that LG learners spent significantly longer fixations than HG 
learners only in the gender-mismatch conditions (F1(1, 52) = 1.767, 
p =  0.190; F2(1, 118) = 14.765, p < 0.001). Besides, first fixation 
durations were significantly longer in gender-mismatch than in 
gender-match conditions but only occurred for LG learners (F1(1, 
52) = 3.253, p = 0.077; F2(1, 118) = 5.789, p = 0.018). In addition, a 
significant interaction between Constraint and Gender Match was 
observed in first fixation durations (p1 = 0.031; p2 = 0.039). Simple 
effects analysis revealed that significantly longer first fixation 
durations in gender-mismatch than in gender-match conditions 
appeared only for no-constraint conditions (F1(1, 52) = 5.747, 
p = 0.020; F2(1, 118) = 5.545, p = 0.020) and significantly longer first 
fixation durations in constraint conditions than in no-constraint 
conditions appeared only in gender-match conditions (F1(1, 
52) = 19.276, p < 0.001; F2(1, 118) = 17.286, p < 0.001).
For first pass reading times and regression path durations, no 
significant main effects or interactions were found (ps > 0.05).
For total reading times, a significant main effect of Constraint 
was found (p1 < 0.001; p2 = 0.045). Reading times were 
significantly longer in no-constraint conditions than in constraint 
conditions. There was also a significant interaction between 
Constraint and Group in the participant analysis (p1 =  0.021; 
p2 = 0.151). Simple effects analysis showed that only LG learners 
spent significantly longer reading times in no-constraint than in 
constraint conditions (F1(1, 52) = 17.493, p < 0.001; F2(1, 
118) = 6.015, p = 0.016).
3.5.2.2. Region 2
For first fixation durations, a significant main effect of 
Constraint was found (p1 = 0.006; p2 = 0.009). Significantly longer 
fixations were observed in constraint than in no-constraint 
conditions. A significant main effect of Gender Match was also 
found (p1 = 0.013; p2 = 0.008). First fixation durations in gender-
mismatch conditions were significantly longer than those in 
gender-match conditions.
For first pass reading times, a significant main effect of Constraint 
was found in the participant analysis (p1 = 0.010; p2 = 0.108). Reading 
times were significantly longer in constraint conditions than in 
no-constraint conditions. There was a significant main effect of 
Gender Match (p1 < 0.001; p2 = 0.003). Reading times in gender-
mismatch conditions were significantly longer than those in gender-
match conditions. Besides, a significant interaction between 
Constraint and Group was observed in the participant analysis

(p1 = 0.029; p2 = 0.207). Simple effects analysis suggested that only LG 
learners exhibited significantly longer reading times in constraint than 
in no-constraint conditions (F1(1, 52) = 10.958, p =  0.002; F2(1, 
118) = 4.180, p = 0.043).
For regression path durations, a significant main effect of 
Constraint was found in the participant analysis (p1 <  0.001; 
p2 =  0.062). Significantly longer regression times were elicited in 
no-constraint conditions than in constraint conditions. There 
occurred a significant interaction between Constraint and Gender 
Match (p1 = 0.013; p2 = 0.054). Simple effects analysis revealed that 
significantly longer regression path durations were observed in 
no-constraint than in constraint conditions but only for gender-
mismatch conditions (F1(1, 52) = 20.457, p < 0.001; F2(1, 118) = 6.538, 
p = 0.012).
For total reading times, a significant main effect of Constraint was

found (p1 = 0.025; p2 = 0.047). Simple effects analysis showed that 
only HG learners demonstrated significantly longer reading times in 
gender-match than in gender-mismatch conditions (F1(1, 52) = 4.808, 
p = 0.033; F2(1, 118) = 2.812, p = 0.096).

major results are presented in the following.1

Main effects of Gender Match were found for early eye-movement 
measures (first fixation durations and first pass reading times) at region 
2, the spillover region of region 1. A gender-mismatching subject name 
elicited significantly longer reading times than a gender-matching one 
in both constraint pair and no-constraint pair. This GMME effect 
unaffected by the factor Constraint suggested that Chinese EFL 
learners tried to establish coreference relations between the cataphoric 
pronoun and the matrix subject in both constraint and no-constraint 
conditions, even if the coreference in constraint conditions violated 
Binding Principle B. The expected interaction between Constraint and 
Gender Match, however, just occurred in the late eye-movement 
measure (regression path durations) at region 2. A gender-mismatching 
subject induced more regressions in no-constraint conditions than in 
constraint conditions. In other words, the gender-incongruency 
between the cataphoric pronoun and the matrix subject only induced 
greater processing difficulty when the coreference between the 
cataphoric pronoun and the matrix subject was free from the constraint 
of Binding Principle B, suggesting that syntactically-illicit subject in 
constraint conditions was no longer considered as the potential 
antecedent of the cataphoric pronoun. Therefore, the early and late 
eye-tracking data at region 2 together demonstrated that Binding 
Principle B did not constrain Chinese EFL learners’ early processing of 
cataphoric pronouns, but only played its role in the late stage of 
cataphora resolution. Meanwhile, Chinese EFL learners’ delayed 
application of Binding Principle B also came up in the different effects 
of Constraint on first fixation durations and total reading times at 
region 2. While the main effect of Constraint on first fixation durations 
indicated that learners had more difficulty in processing constraint 
sentences, the main effect of Constraint on total reading times at the 
same region showed that the learners had more difficulty with 
no-constraint sentences. This indicates that in early processing, 
Chinese EFL learners were considering a potential antecedent which 
should be ruled out by Binding Principle B, but in later processing, they 
only considered a syntactically-licit antecedent for the cataphoric 
pronoun, which was consistent with the conclusion drawn from the 
effects of Gender Match and its interaction with Constraint.
Further evidence supporting Chinese EFL learners’ late application 
of Binding Principle B was also found in late eye-tracking data at region 
3. In this region, the object elicited more regressions in no-constraint 
than in constraint conditions. In no-constraint conditions, both the 
subject and object could be the antecedent of the cataphoric pronoun 
in terms of their syntactic position. In constraint conditions, however, 
only the object was licensed to co-refer with the cataphoric pronoun. 
If Chinese EFL learners abided by Binding Principle B in the late 
processing stage, the matrix subject would not interfere with the late 
integration stage during cataphora resolution in constraint conditions, 
but would exert its influence in no-constraint conditions. As a result, 
more regressive eye-movements from the object would be made in 
no-constraint than in constraint conditions which was just the pattern 
we observed in regression path durations at region 3. Besides, this 
effect of Constraint kept constant at region 4 as indicated by longer 
regression path durations and total reading times in no-constraint than 
in constraint conditions. In spite of Chinese EFL learners’ late 
application of the binding constraint, however, the gender feature of 
research questions.
the syntactically-illicit name (i.e., matrix subject in constraint 
conditions) could still exert its influence on the integration stage in 
cataphora resolution, which can be seen from the longer total reading 
times in constraint, gender-match conditions than in constraint, 
gender-mismatch conditions at region 3.
It is worth-noting that a significant Constraint by Gender Match 
interaction was also observed in first fixation durations at region 1 
(matrix subject name). We did not take this interaction as evidence that 
Principle B was early applied by Chinese EFL learners to constrain the 
cataphora resolution process because this interaction was only found 
in first fixation durations at region 1 and was absent in other early 
eye-movement measures in this region and its spillover region (region 
2). Considering the experimental materials used in our experiment 
were quite different from what were used in previous cataphora 
resolution studies, the interpretation of this seemingly odd interaction 
should start from the structure of our own materials. It might be related 
to the process in which matrix subject is first assigned as the subject of 
the adjunct clause. This may also explain why the effect of Gender 
Match manifested itself in the form of longer reading times in gender-
mismatch than in gender-match conditions. A detailed explanation is 
given in the General Discussion part.
The experimental data also show that learners’ proficiency did not 
influence their processing pattern in cataphora resolution. Except for 
the overall longer reading times observed in LG learners, LG and HG 
learners behaved remarkably alike in terms of the time-course during 
which Binding Principle B was applied to constrain their cataphora 
resolution process, suggesting that learners’ proficiency did not affect 
when the syntactic constraint was applied in cataphora resolution. 
However, it seems that LG learners are less skilled in applying Binding 
Principle B than HG learners during late stages of cataphora resolution, 
as indexed by the Constraint and Group interactions observed for total 
reading times at both region 1 and region 3. Moreover, the Constraint 
and Group interaction observed for first pass reading times at region 2 
seems to suggest that LG learners have more difficulty in retrieving the 
gender feature of the cataphoric pronoun when they started the 
cataphora resolution process just after finishing the interpretation of 
PRO. This is supposed to arise from the fact that the LG learners in our 
Experiment have lower working memory than HG learners. L2 
learners’ working memory has been found to positively correlate with 
their proficiency (van den Noort et al., 2006).
In brief, Binding Principle B constrains Chinese EFL learners’ 
cataphora resolution process, but just works at late stages of cataphora 
resolution. As a whole, the time-course of learners’ application of 
Binding Principle B in English cataphora processing is not modulated 
by their proficiency.
4. General discussion
The two eye-tracking studies aim to investigate how Chinese EFL 
learners with different English proficiency resolve English cataphoric 
pronouns and whether their cataphora resolution process is restricted 
by the syntactic constraint Binding Principle B. Experiment 1 shows 
that Chinese EFL learners initiate an active search in processing the 
cataphoric pronouns, yet along a processing path distinct from English 
natives, and HG learners initiate the active searching process earlier 
than LG learners. Experiment 2 shows that Binding Principle B 
constrains Chinese EFL learners’ cataphora resolution process, but

works only at later stages of cataphora resolution, unlike the early 
application of Binding Principle B by English natives in 
cataphora resolution.
4.1. Active search mechanism adopted by 
Chinese EFL learners in cataphora 
resolution
Just as English natives, Chinese EFL learners also trigger an 
active search for the antecedent upon encountering an English 
cataphoric pronoun. However, the specific searching process is 
quite different from that of English native speakers. Reading times 
of English natives are slowed down by a gender-mismatching name 
at the matrix subject position while reading times of Chinese EFL 
learners are slowed down by a gender-matching name at the same 
position. This unexpected gender-match effect contradicts the 
gender-mismatch effect that has been consistently found in previous 
studies except for Bertenshaw (2009). Bertenshaw (2009) ascribed 
the gender-match effect observed in Japanese EFL learners to the 
influence of learners’ first language in which disjointed coreference 
between the cataphoric pronoun and the first name was preferred 
in the context of experimental sentences. However, this explanation 
cannot account for the gender-match effect in our study for two 
reasons. The first reason is that experimental sentences in 
Bertenshaw’s study differed from what we used. In Bertenshaw’s 
(2009) study, a lead-in sentence containing one male name and one 
female name preceded the critical sentence containing the 
cataphoric pronoun, which made the pronoun not strictly 
cataphoric since it can access interpretation from the male or female 
name based on its gender co-indexation. Therefore, the existence of 
the lead-in sentence might be the real reason that Japanese EFL 
learners’ first language had an impact on their interpretation of the 
cataphoric pronoun. The second reason is that Chinese EFL learners 
do not possess prior knowledge regarding the resolution of 
cataphoric pronouns, for there is no intra-sentential cataphora in 
Chinese (Wang, 1994; Wang, 2000, 2006; Zhao and Shao, 2002). 
Then how to account for the gender-match effect in our study? One 
possibility is that Chinese EFL learners are affected by their 
awareness of first language in the option of processing strategies in 
cataphora resolution. The transfer of L1 processing strategies in L2 
sentence processing has been confirmed by a number of studies 
(e.g., Gass, 1987; Harrington, 1987; Kilborn and Cooreman, 1987; 
Kilborn, 1989; Hernandez et al., 1994; Su, 2001). As Chinese is a 
semantics-driven language (Xu, 1999), Chinese native speakers are 
more concerned with semantic congruity than syntactic congruity 
when processing sentences. This processing preference might 
be transferred to their L2 sentence processing, which makes them 
less error-tolerant in semantic plausibility than English natives 
upon encountering a gender-mismatching potential antecedent in 
cataphora resolution. As mentioned above, before the gender 
feature of the matrix subject name becomes available, a link between 
the cataphoric pronoun and the name has already been established 
by both English native speakers and Chinese EFL learners. When 
the subject name mismatches the cataphoric pronoun in gender, 
Chinese EFL learners can quickly revoke the previously established 
coreference relation and stop taking the subject name as a potential 
antecedent. By contrast, when the information of that name 
matches the cataphoric pronoun in gender, they retain the link and 
engage in a deep processing of the subject name. As a result, more 
reading time was spent on a gender-matching subject name 
compared to a gender-mismatching name. However, a gender-
mismatching subject name cannot make English native speakers 
abandon the established coreference relation in a short time as they 
are more error-tolerant than Chinese EFL learners in English 
sentence processing. Consequently, whether the subject name 
matches or mismatches the cataphoric pronoun in gender, English 
native speakers keep engaged in a deep processing of the name, 
yielding greater processing difficulty at the gender-mismatching 
relative to the gender-matching name region. From a cognitive 
perspective, the L1 transfer found in our study is conceptual 
transfer whose basic idea is that a person’s comprehension and 
production of one language is affected by the concepts and 
conceptualization patterns he acquires in another language (Jarvis, 
2007, 2011). Experientialism argues that although people of 
different nations share the ability to conceptualize their experience, 
they have developed different conceptual systems due to differences 
in their specific life experiences, environments, and cultures 
(Lakoff, 1987). Therefore, Chinese natives differ from English 
natives in terms of their specific conceptual system and conceptual 
patterns, as revealed by their language typology (Chinese, a 
semantics-first language contrasts English, a syntax-first language). 
As a result, Chinese EFL learners’ processing of English sentences 
in our study is subject to the influence of their native language.
At the object name region (region 3), the regression path durations 
and total reading times were significantly longer in gender-match 
conditions than in gender-mismatch conditions. This can be explained 
by the Competition Model (McDonald and MacWhinney, 1995). 
According to the Model, processing should be much more difficult 
when there are two potential antecedents than when there is only one 
for the anaphoric pronoun, because the two potential antecedents 
might compete for the final interpretation of the anaphoric pronoun 
whereas there is no competition involved when only one potential 
antecedent is available. In our Experiment 1, the object name in 
gender-match conditions serves as another potential antecedent for 
the cataphoric pronoun, competing with the subject name for being 
chosen as the final interpretation of the cataphoric pronoun during 
later stages of cataphora resolution. In contrast, the object name in 
gender-mismatch conditions is the only appropriate antecedent for the 
cataphoric pronoun and no competition will arise between the object 
name and the subject name, for the gender feature of the subject name 
clashes with that of the cataphoric pronoun. Evidently, Competition 
Model can not only be used to reveal the processing mechanism 
behind ambiguous forwards anaphora resolution, but also holds 
explanatory power in ambiguous cataphora resolution as in our study.
Apart from the two above-mentioned findings, Experiment 1 also 
demonstrated a modulating effect of learners’ proficiency on the time-
course of their active searching process. Specifically, LG learners 
delayed their active searching process relative to HG learners. 
Following the above-mentioned L1 transfer account, LG learners 
should be more affected by their L1, thereby showing earlier and 
stronger GME effect. However, what we found was just the opposite. 
HG learners exhibited earlier and stronger GME effect than LG 
learners, which means there was another force playing a greater role. 
This dominating force stems from learners’ employment of active 
search mechanism in cataphora resolution. As we have discussed in 
Wang et al. 
10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1126673
Frontiers in Psychology
14
frontiersin.org
the preceding text, readers’ employment of an active search 
mechanism implies two steps: the first step is to predictively establish 
the coreference relationship between the cataphoric pronoun and the 
matrix subject position, and the second step is to access the gender 
feature of the matrix subject to confirm their analysis. Accordingly, 
two reasons might help to explain our results. One is related to LG 
learners’ reduced predictive ability compared to HG learners in L2 
sentence comprehension, which has been demonstrated by several 
studies (e.g., Kaan, 2014; Peters et al., 2015). As a result of LG learners’ 
reduced predictive ability, the predictive process of linking the 
cataphoric pronoun to the matrix subject position (region 1) might 
be slower and more cognitive-demanding for LG learners than HG 
learners. The other reason for our results might be that LG learners 
are slower and less efficient than HG learners in accessing the gender 
features of the matrix subject. According to the revised hierarchical 
model (RHM), L2 and L1 words in the bilingual mental lexicon share 
one conceptual system while their corresponding forms are 
represented separately (Kroll and Stewart, 1994). Several scholars 
(Chen, 1990; Dufour and Kroll, 1995; Cheung and Chen, 1998) 
interpreted the RHM from a developmental perspective and held that 
L2 learners with lower proficiency access L2 word meaning through 
L1 lexicon while learners with higher proficiency access L2 word 
meaning directly via the shared conceptual system, the claim being 
confirmed by several studies (e.g., Jared and Kroll, 2001; Kroll et al., 
2006, 2010). Therefore, it is rational to assume that LG learners in our 
study are slower than HG learners in accessing the gender information 
of the matrix subject. In a word, LG learner’s reduced predictive ability 
and slower access to the gender information of the matrix subject 
together contribute to their relatively delayed employment of the 
active search mechanism in cataphora resolution.
4.2. Late application of principle B by 
Chinese EFL learners in cataphora 
resolution
Chinese EFL learners’ cataphora resolution process was constrained 
by Principle B. However, unlike English native’s early application of 
Principle B, Chinese EFL learners, irrespective of their proficiency levels, 
resorted to Principle B to resolve cataphora at a later stage. Before further 
exploring the underlying reasons for the different processing patterns 
between Chinese EFL learners and English native speakers, we first take 
a look at the seemingly odd Gender Match and Constraint interaction 
observed in first fixation durations at region 1. As we have mentioned in 
3.6, the interpretation of this interaction should be based on the structure 
of the experimental materials used. For better illustration, the exemplar 
sentences in Experiment 2 are repeated here as (7).
 (7) a. constraint, gender-match/mismatch
After PRO buying her/him an iced coffee, Linda generously 
offered Elsa/Victor the best seat at the meeting table.
b. no-constraint, gender-match/mismatch.
After PRO buying her/his colleague an iced coffee, Linda 
generously offered Elsa/Victor the best seat at the meeting table.
The experimental sentences involve two types of cataphoric 
relations, one of which is between PRO and the matrix subject and the 
other is between the cataphoric pronoun and its antecedent. Using the 
same materials, Kush and Dillon (2021) demonstrated that English 
native speakers could process the two types of cataphoric relations 
simultaneously by incrementally integrating syntactic and pragmatic 
information. However, our experimental data suggest that Chinese 
EFL learners could only process the two cataphoric relations one by 
one. Though a couple of studies claim that cataphoric pronouns are 
not used in Chinese (Wang, 1994; Wang, 2000, 2006; Zhao and Shao, 
2002), some scholars take a different view in this issue (Xu and He, 
2007; Gao, 2010; Yu, 2011). For instance, Gao (2010) held that 
cataphoric pronouns existed in Chinese in an invisible and inaudible 
way, i.e., zero cataphoric pronouns are present in Chinese. Gao (2010) 
conducted a corpus-based contrastive study of cataphora in Chinese 
and English, and found that cataphora in Chinese manifested itself 
only in the form of zero pronouns while cataphora in English existed 
in the form of both zero and overt pronouns. At the same time, zero 
cataphoric pronouns in Chinese and English are used in a similar way 
in which the invisible pronoun appears in a preposed modifier and the 
antecedent appears in the matrix subject position or as a modifier of 
the matrix subject. The PRO in our experimental sentence is just the 
kind of zero cataphoric pronouns Gao (2010) has identified. Since this 
kind of zero cataphoric pronouns exists in both Chinese and English 
and is used in a similar way across two languages, Chinese EFL 
learners might prioritize the processing of PRO (i.e., zero cataphoric 
pronoun) over the processing of the overt cataphoric pronoun which 
is rarely used in Chinese. Following this assumption, we can well 
explain the seemingly odd Constraint and Gender Match interaction 
observed in first fixation durations at region 1. Specifically, during the 
early processing of region 1, Chinese EFL learners only completed the 
interpretation of PRO, assigning it to the matrix subject (region 1) 
while the resolution of the cataphoric pronoun had not yet started at 
this time. After the matrix subject was interpreted as the subject of the 
subordinate clause, the meaning of the subordinate clause in 
no-constraint, gender-match conditions was accessed more easily than 
the meaning of the adjunct clause in no-constraint, gender-mismatch 
conditions due to the gender-incongruency between the matrix 
subject and the cataphoric pronoun, thereby resulting in significantly 
longer first fixations in no-constraint, gender-mismatch conditions 
than in no-constraint, gender-match conditions. At the same time, the 
process of assigning the matrix subject name to PRO made the gender 
feature of the matrix subject available to the parser before the 
resolution of cataphoric pronouns started, consequently leading to 
longer reading times being spent on a gender-mismatching subject 
name during cataphora resolution, contrastive to the GME effect 
observed in Experiment 1 where coreference between the cataphoric 
pronoun and the matrix subject was already established even before 
the gender information of the subject name becomes available to the 
parser. In addition to a Constraint and Gender Match interaction, 
there came up a significant Gender Match and Group interaction for 
first fixation durations at region 1. Further analysis on this interaction 
indicated that LG learners were more easily disrupted than HG 
learners by the gender feature of the cataphoric pronoun stored in 
their working memory when assigning the matrix subject to PRO.
Chinese EFL learners behave themselves differently from English 
natives in using Binding Principle B from the perspective of time 
course regarding cataphora resolution. Concerning the time-course of 
syntactic constraints in cataphora resolution, there are two major 
hypotheses. One is the early filter hypothesis, claiming that syntactic 
constraints play an early role in the parser’s active searching process so 
Wang et al. 
10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1126673
Frontiers in Psychology
15
frontiersin.org
that only positions licensed by the grammatical constraints can 
be predictively considered as holding potential antecedents. The other 
one is the delayed filter hypothesis, holding that syntactic constraints 
are applied at a later processing stage to filter out ungrammatical 
interpretations, which implies noun phrases at positions not licensed 
by syntactic constraints are initially considered as potential antecedents. 
So to speak, the performance of English native speakers in Kush and 
Dillon (2021)’s study is consistent with the early filter hypothesis while 
the performance of Chinese EFL learners in our experiment 2 is in line 
with the delayed filter hypothesis. Why does Principle B function as an 
early filter in English natives’ cataphora resolution but a delayed filter 
in Chinese EFL learners’ cataphora resolution? The difference between 
L1 and L2 sentence processing might be responsible for the discrepancy. 
According to Shallow Structure Hypothesis (Clahsen and Felser, 
2006a,b), L2 learners prioritize semantic and pragmatic cues over 
syntactic cues to guide their sentence processing, which leads to 
shallow and less detailed syntactic representations being computed by 
L2 learners, as compared to native speakers. Given that our 
experimental sentences involve two types of cataphoric relations, it is 
rational to assume that Chinese EFL learners have not established the 
required syntactic representations to correctly resolve the cataphoric 
pronoun when first encountering the matrix subject. As a result, the 
EFL learners made the ungrammatical interpretation that is based 
solely on the gender-match between the cataphoric pronoun and the 
matrix subject, without taking the syntactic constraint into account.
Previous forwards anaphora resolution studies show that L2 
learners tend to delay the application of binding constraints (Felser 
et al., 2009; Felser and Cunnings, 2012). Targeting at L2 English 
learners’ online processing of reflexives, both Felser et al. (2009) and 
Felser and Cunnings (2012) found that L2 learners were initially 
affected by a discourse-salient but binding-inaccessible antecedent 
while English native speakers could immediately apply Binding 
Principle A to resolve reflexives, suggesting that L2 learners’ early 
processing of reflexives was not restricted by syntactic constraints. In 
our study, Chinese EFL learners were also found to have delayed their 
application of the binding constraint in cataphora resolution. 
Therefore, the delayed application of binding constraints by L2 
learners in both  forwards anaphora and cataphora resolution adds 
evidence to the claim that L2 learners have more difficulty than native 
speakers in establishing nonadjacent syntactic dependencies in real 
time (Clahsen and Felser, 2006a).
Both Binding Principle B and Binding Principle C are observed by 
EFL learners in English cataphora resolution. Unlike the delayed 
application of Binding Principle B by learners in our study, previous 
cataphora resolution studies demonstrated that native speakers and L2 
learners patterned alike in terms of the time-course of their application 
of Binding Principle C when resolving cataphoric pronouns 
(Rodríguez, 2008; Bertenshaw, 2009; Drummer and Felser, 2018). This 
implies that Binding Principle B and Binding Principle C are treated 
differently by L2 learners. To be more specific, it seems that Binding 
Principle C was more easily applied than Binding Principle B by L2 
learners in their online resolution of cataphoric pronouns. Comparing 
the materials used in previous L2 cataphora resolution studies and 
those used in our study, we find that the coreference relations subject 
to Binding Principle C was more easily detected than those subject to 
Binding Principle B because the structure of sentences involving 
Principle C constraint was much simpler than those involving Principle 
B constraint. On this account, it appears safe to argue that L2 learners’ 
sensitivity to different binding constraints in cataphora resolution is 
also dependent on the complexity of sentences involved. Despite L2 
learners’ divergent sensitivity to Binding Principle B and Binding 
Principle C, all L2 learners can follow these two syntactic constraints 
in the corresponding sentences to exclude ungrammatical antecedents 
when resolving cataphoric pronouns online.
4.3. Chinese EFL learner’s English 
proficiency and their cataphora processing
Chinese EFL learners’ proficiency did not modulate the time-
course of their application of Binding Principle B in cataphora 
resolution. Specifically, both HG and LG learners delayed their 
application of the binding constraint when resolving cataphoric 
pronouns. Nevertheless, the data in Experiment 1 showed that learners’ 
proficiency affected when they initiated an active search for the 
antecedent. What is dedicated to the absence of the modulation effect 
of learners’ proficiency in Experiment 2? We resort to Shallow Structure 
Hypothesis to explain the absence. The key tenet of Shallow Structure 
Hypothesis is that L2 sentence processing is fundamentally different 
from L1 sentence processing and even highly proficient learners cannot 
achieve native-like level in terms of processing complex syntactic 
structures like ambiguous relative clauses and filler-gap dependencies 
while native-like processing of simple syntactic structures like subject-
predicate agreement can be  attained as the learners’ proficiency 
increases. As mentioned in the preceding part, the sentences in 
Experiment 2 involve two types of cataphoric relations and the correct 
resolution of cataphoric pronouns necessitates the successful 
representation of these two types of cataphoric relations. In contrast, 
the sentences in our Experiment 1 are relatively simple and the 
successful resolution of cataphoric pronouns relies more on whether 
the name matches the cataphoric pronoun in gender. That is, since the 
sentences were more complex in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1, 
learners’ proficiency modulated their online performance in 
Experiment 1 but became invisible in Experiment 2.
5. Conclusion
We conducted two eye-tracking studies to investigate how Chinese 
EFL learners with different proficiency resolved cataphoric pronouns 
and whether their cataphora resolution process was restricted by 
Binding Principle B. The results revealed that Chinese EFL learners 
initiated an active search for the antecedent when encountering a 
cataphoric pronoun, yet along a processing path distinct from English 
natives. Specifically, Chinese EFL learners predictively linked a 
cataphoric pronoun to the first potential antecedent, but only a gender-
matching antecedent could prompt them to engage in a deep processing 
of the antecedent, the reason being that concepts and conceptualization 
patterns Chinese EFL learners acquired in their mother tongue 
influenced their English sentence processing. In addition, learners’ 
proficiency modulated the time point at which they initiated an active 
searching process, with HG learners earlier than LG learners. Moreover, 
our results demonstrated that Chinese EFL learners’ cataphora 
resolution process was restricted by Binding Principle B, but the 
application of Binding Principle B was delayed in both HG and LG 
learners compared with English natives, suggesting that Chinese EFL

learners were not so much sensitive to syntactic constraints as English 
natives in cataphora resolution.
To conclude, this study demonstrated how Chinese EFL learners 
resolve cataphoric pronouns. By extending cataphora resolution 
studies to a group of English learners with a distinct L1 (i.e., Chinese) 
in typology, we provide more insights into L2 sentence processing and 
adds more evidence to the Shallow Structure Hypothesis. Subsequent 
studies are expected to explore how English learners with various L1 
backgrounds resolve cataphoric pronouns, as well as whether other 
factors such as learners’ working memory influence their online 
performance on resolving cataphoric pronouns, so as to provide a real 
panorama for the L2 cataphora resolution mechanism.
