Abstract: The aim of this clinical study was to compare the diagnostic performance of dual short
wavelength infrared (SWIR) occlusal transillumination and reﬂectance multispectral imaging with
conventional visual assessment and radiography for caries detection on premolars scheduled for
extraction for orthodontics reasons. Polarized light microscopy (PLM) and micro-computed tomogra-
phy (microCT) performed after tooth extraction were used as gold standards. The custom-fabricated
imaging probe was 3D-printed and the imaging system employed a SWIR camera and ﬁber-optic
light sources emitting light at 1300 nm for occlusal transillumination and 1600 nm for reﬂectance
measurements. Teeth (n = 135) on 40 test subjects were imaged in vivo using the SWIR imaging
prototype in the study and teeth were extracted after imaging. Our study demonstrates for the ﬁrst
time that near-simultaneous real-time transillumination and reﬂectance video can be successfully
acquired for caries detection. Both SWIR imaging modalities had markedly higher sensitivity for le-
sions on proximal and occlusal surfaces compared to conventional methods (visual and radiographic).
Reﬂectance imaging at 1600 nm had higher sensitivity and speciﬁcity than transillumination at
1300 nm. The combined SWIR methods yielded higher speciﬁcity but the combined sensitivity was
lower than for each individual method.

1. Introduction
Despite the introduction of ﬂuoridated drinking water, ﬂuoride dentifrices and rinses,
and improved dental hygiene in the US, dental decay continues to be the leading cause
of tooth loss even though caries progression is potentially preventable and reversible if
detected early [1,2]. The locations of most newly discovered caries are on the occlusal
pits/ﬁssures of the posterior dentition and the interproximal contact sites between adjacent
teeth where physical access is difﬁcult. Radiographs have low diagnostic sensitivity due to
overlapping enamel [3,4]. Stains interfere with visual diagnosis and other proposed imaging
technologies such as ﬁber optic transillumination or ﬂuorescence-based methods and may
increase false positives [5]. Likewise, early lesions on proximal surfaces can also be difﬁcult
to detect due to lack of physical access and the challenge of radiographically identifying the
initial, subtle mineral loss of these lesions [3,4]. Radiographs are not effective for the early
detection of occlusal caries lesions because of the overlapping features of the crowns [6–8].
Lesions are not typically visible on radiographs until decalciﬁcation has exceeded 30% [3,4],
while SWIR imaging methods are diagnostic with only 5% decalciﬁcation [9]. Moreover,
the risk of exposure to ionizing radiation is poorly understood, and even greatly reduced
levels of radiation exposure may still pose a signiﬁcant risk, especially for children and
pregnant women. It is unlikely that improvements in radiographic sensitivity will enable
the detection of hidden occlusal lesions or an improved diagnosis of suspicious occlusal

caries lesions, those lesions with no cavitation and no radiographic radiolucency, but where
caries is suspected due to surface roughness, opacities, or staining [6–8].
A highly sensitive and more reliable method for detecting demineralization during early
lesion formation would be valuable for clinicians to monitor the activity of new caries and to
assess the efficacy of non-surgical intervention. Short wavelength infrared (SWIR) and near-IR
imaging (NIR) methods have been under development for almost 20 years for use in dentistry
and several NIR clinical devices are now available commercially. Due to the high transparency
of enamel at longer wavelengths, multiple imaging configurations are feasible. Lesions can
be imaged using transillumination and reflectance from tooth occlusal, buccal, and lingual
surfaces [9]. In proximal transillumination, the light source and detector are placed on the buccal
and lingual sides of the tooth. The positions can be alternated to obtain images of each surface
since this method will have greater sensitivity for those lesions located closer to the detector [9].
This is the same imaging geometry used to acquire bitewing radiographs. Interproximal lesions,
the lesions located at the proximal contact points in between teeth, can be imaged via all three
imaging geometries. Transillumination of the proximal contact points between teeth can also be
accomplished via occlusal transillumination by directing SWIR light below the crown while
imaging the occlusal surface [9,10] (see Figure 1). The latter approach that was used in this study
is capable of imaging occlusal lesions as well with high contrast [9]. The first clinical SWIR/NIR
study was carried out in 2010; it was demonstrated that interproximal lesions that appeared on
radiographs could be detected in vivo using proximal and occlusal transillumination imaging
at 1310 nm with similar sensitivity [10]. Currently, the only clinical systems that are available
operate at shorter NIR wavelengths at 830 and 780 nm [11–14]. The use of shorter wavelength
830 nm NIR light was first investigated more than 20 years ago when it was found that the
contrast between sound and demineralized enamel was higher at longer SWIR wavelengths [9].
Shorter wavelengths allow the use of less expensive silicon-based detectors. However, longer
wavelength SWIR light has significant advantages, stains interfere significantly at wavelengths
less than 1200 nm [5] and the contrast between sound and demineralized enamel is markedly
higher at wavelengths beyond 1400 nm in reflectance measurements [9].
 
especially for children and pregnant women. It is unlikely that improvements in radio-
graphic sensitivity will enable the detection of hidden occlusal lesions or an improved 
diagnosis of suspicious occlusal caries lesions, those lesions with no cavitation and no 
radiographic radiolucency, but where caries is suspected due to surface roughness, opac-
ities, or staining [6–8]. 
A highly sensitive and more reliable method for detecting demineralization during 
early lesion formation would be valuable for clinicians to monitor the activity of new car-
ies  and  to  assess  the  eﬃcacy  of  non-surgical  intervention.  Short  wavelength  infrared 
(SWIR) and near-IR imaging (NIR) methods have been under development for almost 20 
years for use in dentistry and several NIR clinical devices are now available commercially. 
Due to the high transparency of enamel at longer wavelengths, multiple imaging conﬁg-
urations are feasible. Lesions can be imaged using transillumination and reﬂectance from 
tooth occlusal, buccal, and lingual surfaces [9]. In proximal transillumination, the light 
source and detector are placed on the buccal and lingual sides of the tooth. The positions 
can be alternated to obtain images of each surface since this method will have greater 
sensitivity for those lesions located closer to the detector [9]. This is the same imaging 
geometry used to acquire bitewing radiographs. Interproximal lesions, the lesions located 
at the proximal contact points in between teeth, can be imaged via all three imaging ge-
ometries. Transillumination of the proximal contact points between teeth can also be ac-
complished via occlusal transillumination by directing SWIR light below the crown while 
imaging the occlusal surface [9,10] (see Figure 1). The latter approach that was used in this 
study is capable of imaging occlusal lesions as well with high contrast [9]. The ﬁrst clinical 
SWIR/NIR study was carried out in 2010; it was demonstrated that interproximal lesions 
that appeared on radiographs could be detected in vivo using proximal and occlusal trans-
illumination imaging at 1310 nm with similar sensitivity [10]. Currently, the only clinical 
systems that are available operate at shorter NIR wavelengths at 830 and 780 nm [11–14]. 
The use of shorter wavelength 830 nm NIR light was ﬁrst investigated more than 20 years 
ago when it was found that the contrast between sound and demineralized enamel was 
higher at longer SWIR wavelengths [9]. Shorter wavelengths allow the use of less expen-
sive silicon-based detectors. However, longer wavelength SWIR light has signiﬁcant ad-
vantages, stains interfere signiﬁcantly at wavelengths less than 1200 nm [5] and the con-
trast between sound and demineralized enamel is markedly higher at wavelengths be-
yond 1400 nm in reﬂectance measurements [9].

Studies over the past decade have indicated that transillumination performs best at
1300 nm where the transparency of enamel is highest while the contrast of lesions on tooth
surfaces imaged using reﬂectance continues to increase with increasing wavelength and
is highest at 1950 nm [9]. Several studies have investigated multispectral measurements

using either one modality or combining transillumination and reﬂectance measurements.
Zakian et al. [15,16] used multiple wavelengths of SWIR hyperspectral reﬂectance images
to estimate the severity of occlusal lesions. Since multispectral SWIR reﬂectance and transil-
lumination experiments have demonstrated that the tooth appears darker at wavelengths
coincident with increased water absorption, multispectral images can be used to produce
increased contrast between different tooth structures such as sound enamel and dentin,
dental decay, and composite restorative materials [9,16]. Combining measurements from
different SWIR imaging wavelengths and comparing them with concurrent measurements
acquired by complementary imaging modalities should provide an improved assessment
of lesion depth and severity. Radiographs markedly underestimate the depth and sever-
ity of interproximal lesions and clinicians assume that lesions penetrate much deeper
than indicated in radiographs [17–19]. SWIR occlusal transillumination and reﬂectance
have been combined into a single probe and tested in vitro [20]. Different illumination
wavelengths have been optimized for each imaging mode, namely SWIR wavelengths
greater than 1400 nm for reﬂectance and 1300 nm for transillumination. Simon et al. [21]
built a benchtop simultaneous SWIR reﬂectance and transillumination system with tun-
able ﬁlters that ranged from 830–1700 nm and showed that the combined images have
potential for the diagnosis of occlusal lesions and simulated cavitated and noncavitated in-
terproximal lesions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance
of a dual SWIR occlusal transillumination and reﬂectance device in vivo on teeth sched-
uled for extraction for orthodontic reasons. This is the ﬁrst clinical study to employ dual
SWIR transillumination and reﬂectance integrated into a single imaging device. In a prior
SWIR clinical imaging study, separate occlusal and proximal imaging devices operating at
1300 nm were used along with reﬂectance imaging at 1450 nm [22]. That study showed
that occlusal transillumination and reﬂectance imaging both had higher performance than
proximal transillumination. In addition to their higher performance, it is much easier to
combine occlusal transillumination and reﬂectance imaging into a single device. That study
also showed that each device performed as well as radiographs for proximal lesions and if
multiple devices were combined the sensitivity was much higher than for radiography [22].
Higher sensitivity may be of potential concern if it leads to over-treatment due to a high
number of false positives. We hypothesize that the use of a single SWIR occlusal transillu-
mination and reﬂectance imaging will increase the speciﬁcity and reduce the potential for
false positives.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participant Recruitment and Procedures
Study participants (n = 40 with 139 premolars) aged 12–60 with 2–4 premolars sched-
uled for extraction for orthodontic reasons were recruited from the UCSF Orthodontic
Clinic by the study investigators (UCSF IRB 19-27656). One participant was lost to follow-
up after the ﬁrst visit and was excluded from the study. A total of 39 participants (n = 39
with 135 premolars) completed the study. Color images of each tooth were acquired using
a FocusDent MD740 (Vilnius, Lithuania) 1280 × 960 pixel intraoral camera, and lesions
were visually assessed. After extraction and before sectioning teeth were mounted in black
Delrin blocks and imaged with digital radiographs using a CareStream 2200 System from
Kodak (Rochester, NY, USA) operating at 60 kV. Radiographical contrast was calculated
using (IS-IL)/IS for each proximal contact. Where IL is the lesion area and IS is the sound
control area. Areas for each IL and IS measurement were selected using PLM and microCT.
IL was measured as the mean intensity over the lesion area at each proximal contact and
IS was selected at a position either directly below or directly above IL to ensure a similar
enamel thickness. If no lesion was present the mean intensity was measured in an area of
20 × 20 pixels at the contact area to serve as IL and an adjacent area was chosen for IS.

2.2. Design and Fabrication of the Dual Reﬂectance and Occlusal Transillumination SWIR Probe
The dual probe design consists of a reﬂectance probe body and an occlusal transil-
lumination attachment, shown in Figure 1. The reﬂectance probe body and the occlusal
transillumination attachment were 3D printed and are autoclavable. There is an air nozzle
near the mirror to prevent fogging of the mirror. The air nozzle can also be used to dry the
lesion to increase lesion contrast and potentially assess lesion activity.
The dual reﬂectance and occlusal transillumination SWIR probe was designed in
Fusion 360 from Autodesk (San Francisco, CA, USA). The handpiece was fabricated using
a Formlabs (Somerville, MA, USA) Form 3 Low Force Stereolithography 3D printer. The
probe consists of two components, a main body containing the light source for reﬂectance
and the light collection optics and a second attachment containing the transillumination
light source. Details regarding the fabrication of the dual occlusal transillumination and
reﬂectance imaging probe system and optical probe have been previously described [20].
2.3. Image Acquisition and Analysis
The SWIR images were captured using a 640 × 480 pixel micro-SWIR camera (SU640CSX)
measuring only 32 × 32 × 28 mm from Sensors Unlimited (Princeton, NJ, USA). Two planocon-
vex antireflection coated lenses of 60 and 100 mm focal length along with an adjustable aper-
ture were placed between the handpiece and the InGaAs camera to provide a field of view of
11 mm2 at the focus plane. A low-OH optical fiber of 1 mm diameter was used to deliver light
from a 1604 nm superluminescent diode (SLD), Model ESL 1620-2111 from Exalos (Schlieren,
Switzerland) with an output of 17 mW and a bandwidth of 46 nm. The intensity delivered
to the tooth was 5 mW. The 1600 nm light passes through a polarizing beam-splitting cube
before incidence on the tooth and a linear polarizer was placed before the camera to achieve
cross-polarization for glare reduction. The transillumination light was delivered through
two 0.4 mm diameter low-OH optical fibers. A 1314 nm (BW) SLD, Model DL-CS3452A-FP
1620-2111 from Denselight (Singapore) with an output of 48 mW and a bandwidth of 33 nm
was used as the source for transillumination. A 50/50 beam splitter was used to deliver light
to each arm for transillumination. The output intensity of each arm was set at 10 mw before
entering the Teflon plugs located at the end of each arm.
Image processing of the images was performed by custom scripts written using
MATLAB from Mathworks (Natick, MA, USA). The acquired 12 bit images (4096) were
converted to 16 bit (65,535) by multiplying by 16 and subtracting 1 to facilitate processing
using MATLAB. Contrast was calculated at 3 different lesion locations including occlusal
grooves or ﬁssures and the proximal mesial and distal contacts. The contrast was calculated
for each location using the formula (IL − IS)/IL for reﬂectance images and (IS − IL)/IS
for transillumination images. IL was measured as the mean intensity over the lesion area.
IS was selected at adjacent conﬁrmed sound locations [5]. IL was also measured at the
proximal contact or occlusal ﬁssure even if no lesion was present in order to measure the
contrast of sound areas for comparison. If no lesion was present the mean intensity was
measured in an area of 20 × 20 pixels at the contact area to serve as IL and an adjacent area
was chosen for IS. Lesion areas were conﬁrmed using the PLM and microCT images.
2.4. Sectioning, Polarized Light Microscopy (PLM) and Microcomputed Tomography (microCT)
The ﬁrst 40 extracted teeth were sectioned and examined with polarized light mi-
croscopy (PLM). The remaining 95 teeth were examined intact using microcomputed X-ray
tomography (microCT). The acquisition of an in-house microCT system mid-way through
the study allowed us to switch to microCT. MicroCT does not require physical section-
ing and avoids the risk of sample loss during sectioning. Samples (n = 40) were serially
sectioned into ~200 µm thick mesiodistal slices using a linear precision saw, Isomet 5000
(Buehler, Lake Buff, IL, USA). PLM was used for histological examination of the thin sec-
tions using a Meiji Techno RZT microscope (Saitama, Japan) with an integrated digital
camera, Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT (Tokyo, Japan). Sample sections were imbibed in
Diagnostics 2023, 13, 2824
5 of 12
deionized water and examined in the bright ﬁeld mode with crossed-polarizers and a red I
plate (550 nm retardation).
Whole teeth (n = 95) were imaged using microCT with a 10 µm resolution. A Scanco
MicroCT 50 from Scanco USA (Wayne, PA, USA) was used to acquire the images. Acquisi-
tion parameters used for the microCT images were 90 kVP, 200 uA, 18 W, 20 FOV, 10 µm
voxel size, 500 ms integration time, and an aluminum 0.5 mm ﬁlter.
3. Results
3.1. Imaged Teeth and Lesion Statistics
A total of 40 patients were recruited from the UCSF Orthodontics clinic. A total number
of 135 teeth were imaged with 135 occlusal surfaces and 270 proximal surfaces for a total of
405 surfaces. However, 51 surfaces were excluded from the ﬁnal analysis for the following
reasons: pre-existing sealants, composite restorations, orthodontic bonding adhesive, tooth
restored with composite after imaging, and tooth severely damaged during extraction.
Hence, the total number of surfaces that were included in the ﬁnal analysis totaled 354. The
354 surfaces were categorized based on surface type (sound tooth structure, enamel and
dentinal lesions, and surface location (occlusal or proximal)). PLM/microCT identiﬁed
27 occlusal surfaces, 100 mesial proximal surfaces, and 86 distal proximal surfaces as sound
tooth structures. Those surfaces are summarized in Table 1. There were 76 occlusal enamel
lesions, 18 mesial enamel lesions, and 31 distal enamel lesions. Lesions penetrating the
underlining dentin (dentinal lesions) were found on 11 occlusal surfaces, 3 mesial surfaces,
and 2 distal surfaces. Cracks were found on 1 occlusal surface, 6 mesial surfaces, and
4 distal surfaces. One single distal cavitation was discovered by the microCT analysis that
was also classiﬁed as one of the ﬁve proximal dentinal lesions. Visual and radiographic
assessment was carried out by three clinical examiners using the intraoral color images and
radiographs taken of the extracted teeth. The diagnostic performance of these conventional
methods is summarised in Table 2.

Images from one tooth from the study with two interproximal lesions are shown in
Figure 2. The color image in Figure 2A shows a bicuspid with a sealant on the occlusal
surface along with a visible lesion on the distal surface. Neither lesion is obvious in the
radiograph in Figure 2B. Only one of the three clinical examiners detected the lesion on
the distal surface in the radiograph and by visual examination and none identiﬁed the
lesion on the mesial surface by radiograph or visual examination. After tooth extraction
and sectioning, PLM in Figure 2C shows that lesions are present on the distal and mesial
surfaces. The SWIR reﬂectance and occlusal transillumination images acquired with the
dual probe are shown in Figure 2D,E and both lesions are visible in the yellow circles.

in Figure 3A shows a bicuspid with hypomineralization and areas of high reﬂectivity
near the mesial and distal surfaces indicated by the green arrows. No lesions are obvious
in the radiograph in Figure 3B. Only one of the three clinical examiners detected the
proximal lesion on the distal surface in the radiograph and none identiﬁed it by visual
assessment. The SWIR occlusal transillumination and reﬂectance images acquired with the
dual probe are shown in Figure 3C,D and both images show occlusal and proximal lesions
in the positions of the yellow boxes. MicroCT images in Figure 3E,F show that lesions are
present in the same areas of the yellow boxes. It is interesting that the bright areas in the
color image of Figure 3A do not correspond to lesion areas. It is likely they are due to

the radiograph in (B). SWIR reﬂectance (C) and occlusal transillumination (D) images show occlusal
and proximal lesions in the positions of the yellow boxes. MicroCT images show lesions on the distal
proximal surface (E) and the occlusal (F) surface as indicated by the red arrows.
There were 16 lesions that penetrated into dentin, 11 occlusal lesions, and 5 lesions on
proximal surfaces. None of the 11 occlusal dentinal lesions were detected by radiography.
Radiography detected 3 out of 5 of the proximal lesions (mean of 3 examiners) and only
1 out of the 5 proximal lesions had a radiographic contrast greater than 0.1. Visual assess-
ment (mean of 3 examiners) detected 1 out of 5 of the proximal lesions and 4 out of the
11 occlusal lesions. SWIR reﬂectance (contrast > 0.1) detected 6 of the 11 occlusal lesions
and 5 out 5 of the proximal lesions while 8 of the 11 occlusal lesions and 3 out 5 of the
proximal lesions were detected by SWIR occlusal transillumination (contrast > 0.1).
3.2. Diagnostic Performance Based on Contrast Thresholds
A total of 87 occlusal lesions (enamel and dentinal) were identiﬁed from PLM/MicroCT.
Only one occlusal lesion was identiﬁed on radiographs by the three clinical examiners.
The mean contrast of the occlusal lesions for SWIR reﬂectance was 0.18 ± 0.14 and that
for occlusal transillumination was 0.16 ± 0.08. For both modalities, the contrast was
signiﬁcantly higher in lesion areas.
There were 54 proximal lesions that were detected using PLM/microCT and the
mean ± (SD) of the radiographic contrast was 0.03 ± 0.04. The radiographic contrast for
all the proximal lesions that were detected by at least one of the three clinical examiners
(n = 23) was 0.07 ± 0.08 and the radiographic contrast for the proximal lesions that were
detected by all three of the clinical examiners was (n = 3) 0.11 ± 0.06. The mean contrast
Diagnostics 2023, 13, 2824

for SWIR reﬂectance was 0.19 ± 0.15 and that for SWIR transillumination was 0.13 ± 0.08.
These values are tabulated in Table 3.

Sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and accuracy were calculated for reﬂectance, transillumination,

higher than that particular threshold it was considered a detected lesion. Plots of the
accuracy versus contrast threshold are shown in Figure 4. An examination of Figure 4
shows that the accuracy reaches a plateau for lesions on proximal surfaces after a contrast
threshold of 0.1 and drops after 0.1 for occlusal lesions on occlusal surfaces. Therefore,
we chose a contrast threshold of 0.1 to calculate the diagnostic performance of reﬂectance,
transillumination and both combined and the results are tabulated in Table 4.

4. Discussion
In this study, the diagnostic performance of a dual SWIR occlusal transillumination and
reflectance imaging device was assessed in vivo on teeth scheduled for extraction based on
orthodontic reasons. Caries status was unknown prior to imaging and PLM and microCT
were used as gold standards. In this study, most of the 141 lesions were small and confined to
the enamel. There were only 16 lesions that penetrated into the dentin and there was only
one severe lesion that was cavitated and penetrated into the inner half of the dentin. The
diagnostic performance of the SWIR methods was compared with conventional visual and
radiographic methods. The motivation for combining reflectance and transillumination was
to increase diagnostic performance by reducing false positives and providing more accurate
measurements of lesion severity. The specificity did increase to 0.93 for proximal surfaces
and 0.96 for occlusal surfaces for combined SWIR imaging. However, the accuracy for the
combined methods was lower than for SWIR reflectance alone.
The posterior occlusal surfaces and interproximal surfaces between adjacent posterior
teeth are challenging areas to detect early demineralization using radiography, due to the
overlapping topography of the occlusal surface and the low sensitivity for detection of early
proximal lesions that extend only into enamel. Visual detection of early demineralization
on occlusal surfaces may also be confounded by staining in the occlusal ﬁssures that make
it difﬁcult for clinicians to accurately pinpoint the areas of demineralization [5]. Stains
also tend to make early lesions appear more severe. A thorough and complete removal
of all stains from the pits and ﬁssures is not clinically feasible. Visual and radiographic
assessments were performed on the teeth by three clinical examiners. Based on the poor
agreement of conventional diagnosis for which the examiners have had many years of
experience, we decided to measure and compare the radiographic lesion contrast and
the SWIR lesion contrast. In addition, in our prior dual transillumination and reﬂectance
in vitro SWIR imaging study, there was poor agreement among clinical examiners which
can be attributed to limited experience with new technology [20].
Prior studies have demonstrated that occlusal transillumination and reﬂectance imag-
ing modalities using longer wavelengths may offer higher sensitivity regarding early
lesion detection [11,12,14,22], but each individual imaging modality on its own has lower
speciﬁcity than radiography and may lead to more false positives. We demonstrated
in this study that it is possible to capture near-simultaneous occlusal transillumination
(1300 nm) and reﬂectance (1600 nm) videos of lesions successfully in vivo, which has not
been conducted prior to this study. Both imaging modalities, whether considered sepa-
rately or when combined, had markedly higher sensitivity for lesions on both proximal
and occlusal surfaces compared to conventional visual assessment and radiography. It is
important to note that the teeth utilized in this study were subject to crowding and were
extracted for orthodontic reasons. SWIR imaging was performed in vivo while radiography
Diagnostics 2023, 13, 2824
10 of 12
was performed on the teeth after extraction and did not suffer interference from crowding.
Therefore, we suspect that the diagnostic performance of radiography would likely be even
lower if it was performed in vivo with many overlapping teeth.
Higher sensitivity in detecting early lesions should be advantageous because clinicians
can better assess the caries risk of the individual and intervene earlier with minimally
invasive techniques to prevent such lesions from progressing further to avoid the need for
surgical intervention. SWIR methods do not utilize ionizing radiation and are well suited
for monitoring lesions over time to determine if they increase in severity.
The performance of reﬂectance imaging at 1600 nm was higher than for transillumina-
tion imaging at 1300 nm. One can argue that the performance of combined SWIR reﬂectance
and transillumination was not any better than SWIR reﬂectance alone. Additional analysis
needs to be performed to better assess the advantages of the combined imaging approach
and fully evaluate the ability to assess lesion depth and severity. It was interesting that
SWIR transillumination was most effective in detecting 8/11 of the deeper occlusal lesions
that penetrated into the dentin.
SWIR imaging is particularly well suited for use with artiﬁcial intelligence (AI).
Casalegno et al. showed that AI could be used to analyze clinical near-IR transillumi-
nation images at 780 nm [23]. The much higher lesion contrast of SWIR methods compared
to radiography and the lack of interference due to stains are major advantages that can
likely be exploited using AI approaches to identify lesions.
This study suggests that SWIR Imaging methods offer high sensitivity for lesions on
proximal and occlusal surfaces without the interference of stains that appear at wavelengths
of less than 1200 nm. No SWIR methods are currently available in the commercial market
due to high cost and security concerns, but we anticipate that this innovative technology
will increasingly become more accessible for medical use. Commercial NIR imaging
devices for caries detection operate at 780 and 850 nm, where studies show that there is
still signiﬁcant interference from stains [5]. In addition, the contrast between sound and
demineralized tooth structure has previously been shown to be markedly higher at longer
SWIR wavelengths than it is at 780 or 850 nm [5,9]. The primary disadvantage of operating
at longer SWIR wavelengths is that Si-based imaging technologies are only efﬁcient at
wavelengths under 1000 nm. Alternative imaging technologies such as InGaAs and Ge-
enhanced Si are still expensive. The limited use of these more innovative semiconductor
technologies is a major reason for the high cost. However, with expanded use, those prices
are expected to decrease. The cost has decreased signiﬁcantly in the past 10 years and the
performance has increased markedly.
5. Conclusions
Combined SWIR occlusal transillumination and reﬂectance images yielded an increase
in speciﬁcity for lesions on both occlusal and proximal surfaces. The sensitivity of the
SWIR imaging methods was markedly higher than for conventional methods. The contrast
of lesions in the occlusal pits and ﬁssures and the proximal contacts where most lesions
are located was signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) than sound areas for both SWIR occlusal
transillumination and reﬂectance while there was no signiﬁcant difference in contrast
between lesion and sound areas for radiography.
