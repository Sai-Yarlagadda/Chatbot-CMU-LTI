Abstract—In this paper, we propose a via-less fully screen-
printed reconfigurable intelligent surface which can establish a 
second line-of-sight communication from 23.5GHz to 29.5GHz. 
By serially connecting the H shaped resonator along the H field 
of the incident wave, we minimize the effect of the biasing lines 
and make a via-less design, which reduces the fabrication 
difficulty and cost. The unit-cell simulation of the array with 
screen-printed VO2 switches shows a 215° to 160° phase shift 
difference between the ON and OFF states within bandwidth. 
During the field testing of the ideal arrays, we verify that the 
array can redirect the 45° incident wave to 0° reflection with a 
signal enhancement of at least 10 dB as compared to the array 
which has all unit cells in the OFF condition.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
The 5G and beyond millimeter wave communication is 
gaining more and more attraction thanks to its high bandwidth 
and low latency [1]. However, as the wavelength decreases to 
millimeters, the signal path has an increased loss and can be 
easily blocked by obstacles in direct-link communications. To 
overcome this problem, the reconfigurable intelligent surface 
(RIS) is proposed to fix the coverage holes by controlling the 
surface phase distribution and redirecting the reflected beam to 
the receiver [1]. 
A RIS consists of an array of switchable elements, and its 
performance enhances as the array size increases [1]. Usually, 
the implementations of reconfigurability involve active 
switches [2] such as PIN diodes and MEMS, or tunable devices 
such as varactors, etc. They can indeed provide low loss and 
good reconfigurability in phase, but the cost increases 
significantly when the array size is large. What’s more, most 
RIS designs require at least one layer of resonators and another 
layer of biasing lines, which introduce vias and increase loss, 
fabrication difficulty, and cost.  
To have a large RIS array with low cost and ease of 
fabrication, we propose a via-less RIS operating from 23.5GHz 
to 29.5GHz with fully screen-printed VO2 switches [3] as well 
as silver (Ag) paste conductors. The unit cell of the array 
combines the resonator as well as the serial biasing network, 
which only requires one layer of the screen-printing process [4] 
without vias. 
II. 
UNIT CELL DESIGN AND SIMULATION  
The unit cell design is shown in Fig. 1. The RIS consists of 
three layers, which are the ground plane, the substrate, and the 
resonator. The resonator is H-shaped with a wide main dipole 
branch and narrow biasing branches. The main branch is in 
parallel with the polarization of the incidence. In the middle of 
the dipole main branch, as shown in the green sections in Fig. 1, 
the VO2 switches are screen-printed to control the states of the 
resonators. The switch-on resistance is 4 Ω and the switch-off 
resistance is 1000 Ω . Along the H field direction, the 
resonators are serially connected and each column of 
resonators can be controlled with only one biasing line. 
For ease of printing and testing, we place the resonators on 
a 50 um PEN sheet and then attach the sheet to the substrate. 
The substrate is 0.8mm AF32 eco glass with a permittivity of 
5.1 and a loss tangent of 0.0086 at 28.5GHz. The ground plane 
and the conductor part of the resonator are modeled with 50 um 
Ag paste conductor and the conductivity is 7 × 106 S/m. 
 
Figure 1. Unit cell design (dimensions are in millimeters) 
As the unit cell periodicity decreases, the reflection 
magnitude and bandwidth increase [5]. Since the screen-
printed materials have a higher conductor loss and switch 
resistance loss than copper and active switches, the unit cell 
should be reduced compared with the traditional PCB-based 
RIS. The periodicity of the resonator is 2.3mm, which is 36.1% 
of the guided wavelength at 29.5 GHz. 
The simulated phase shift and magnitude of the unit cell 
with periodic boundary conditions and Floquet port excitation 
are plotted in Fig. 2(a). As frequency increases from 23.5 GHz 
to 29.5 GHz, the phase shift difference between the switch-off 
and the switch-on states decreases from 215° to 160°. The 
switch-off magnitude decreases from 0.94 to 0.88, and the 
switch-on magnitude increases from 0.57 to 0.74. The loss of 
the switch-on state is contributed by the VO2 switch-on 
resistance. 
To see the effect of the biasing lines, the surface current 
distributions of both ON and OFF states are plotted in Fig. 2(b) 
and (c). At letter A in Fig. 2(b), the biasing line connects the 
two H-shaped resonators. For both ON and OFF states, the 
connection segments have the minimum resonant current and 
thus they have little effect on the resonator. 
The phase shift difference between the two states can also 
be explained with the surface current distributions. When the 
switch is ON, the VO2 labeled in letter B in Fig. 2(b) connects 
the two segments of the resonator and lets current flow through. 
Thus, the resonator has a longer current path and a lower 
resonant frequency. When the switch is OFF, the switch 
isolates the two segments and the resonant path becomes much 
shorter. Thus, the resonant frequency increases.

III. ARRAY FABRICATION AND MEASUREMENT 
As an initial proof of concept and to estimate the 
performance limit of the final array with printed VO2 switches, 
we print a 20×20 ideal array of resonators on PEN sheets with 
commercial Ag paste only, which is shown in Fig. 3(a). For 
different array configurations, we print different combinations 
of ON and OFF resonator columns. The ON resonator column 
has the Ag paste ink printed in the letter B region in and at the 
OFF column, we leave the VO2 switch unprinted as a slot. As 
Fig. 3(b) shows, we attach the printed RIS film to the glass 
substrate, which is backed by copper tapes as the ground plane. 
As Fig. 3(b) shows, the ON array pattern is demonstrated 
with black and red blocks, where the ON columns are labeled 
in black and the OFF columns are in red. The column patterns 
are determined using the following equation [2]. 
Δ𝜑 =
2𝜋
𝜆 (𝑟𝑡𝑥
̅̅̅̅ − 𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑛
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ − 𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅) ⋅ 𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑛
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ 
(1) 
In (1), 𝜆 is the free space wavelength at 27.5GHz. 𝑟𝑡𝑥
̅̅̅̅ is the 
position of the Tx antenna. 𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑛
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ is the center position of the 
column to be configured. 𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ is the normalized reflection 
direction vector. When Δ𝜑 is closer to the switch-off instead of 
the switch-on phase shift at 27.5 GHz in Fig. 2(a), the column 
uses an OFF pattern, and vice versa. 
The measurement setup is shown in Fig. 3(b). A pair of 20 
dBi standard horn antennas are placed in front of the RIS array. 
The transmitting (Tx) antenna is placed 20 cm away from the 
RIS with a 45° incident angle. The receiving (Rx) antenna is 
placed in the normal direction of the RIS at 20 cm away. The 
Tx antenna is connected to port 1 of a VNA and the Rx antenna 
is connected to port 2. The S21 is measured as the relative 
received power after the Tx power is reflected by the RIS in 
the normal direction.  
The measurement result is shown in Fig. 3(c). We can see 
that from 23.5 GHz to 29.5 GHz, the array has at least 10 dB 
signal enhancement when switched from all-column-OFF 
patterns to ON patterns. The ripples of the ON RIS are 
contributed by the unit cells near the end of the columns. 
Compared with the unit cells at the array center, the distance 
from those at the end of columns to the Rx and Tx antennas is 
larger than that of the center unit cells, which introduces 
additional phase shift error.

IV. CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, we have designed via-less fully screen-
printed RIS unit cells with a single top layer combining 
resonators and serial biasing lines. We have also demonstrated 
an ideal 20x20 RIS array, which can direct the reflection beam 
from a 45° incident angle to a 0° reflection angle with at least 
10 dB signal enhancement from 23.5 GHz to 29.5 GHz. The 
array design is suitable for large-scale screen-printing 
processes and is easy to increase the size while maintaining 
simplistic serial biasing lines for each column of resonators.
