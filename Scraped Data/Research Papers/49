Abstract
Objective: The purpose of this study was to use cross polarization optical
coherence tomography (CP‐OCT) and short wavelength infrared imaging (SWIR)
reﬂectance imaging to monitor changes in the structure and activity of early
occlusal caries on primary teeth over a period of 6 months during intervention
with ﬂuoride.
Methods: Participants (n = 29) aged 6−10 each with two suspected active occlusal
lesions on primary teeth completed the study. Fluoride varnish was applied to
tooth surfaces every 3‐months and participants were instructed to brush twice
daily with a ﬂuoride toothpaste. Images were acquired using CP‐OCT every
3 months for 6 months. SWIR reﬂectance images were acquired during forced
air‐drying of the lesions for 30 s at 0 and 6‐months.
Results: Most of the 42 lesions appeared initially active at baseline. Only 6 lesions
appeared arrested at baseline based on the presence of a highly mineralized
transparent surface layer (TSL) in CP‐OCT images. At 6 months, 14 of the lesions
appeared arrested including the 6 initially arrested lesions and the TSL thickness
increased signiﬁcantly (p < 0.0001). The mean lesion depth (Ld) and the
integrated
reﬂectivity
over
the
lesion
depth
(ΔR)
increased
signiﬁcantly
(p < 0.05) after 6 months for the 42 lesions analyzed. SWIR reﬂectance images
showed that there was a signiﬁcantly higher (p < 0.05) delay before changes in
intensity were measured for active lesions versus arrested lesions during lesion
drying.
Conclusion: CP‐OCT was able to monitor changes in lesion structure and activity
including the formation of a highly mineralized TSL indicative of lesion arrest
during nonsurgical intervention. Time‐resolved SWIR reﬂectance imaging also
shows that there are differences in the dehydration kinetics between active and
arrested lesions. This study demonstrates two independent imaging methods that
can be used to monitor changes in lesion activity over time.

INTRODUCTION
The accurate assessment of lesion activity is essential for
the effective clinical management of caries lesions. Caries
lesions are arrested by the preferential deposition of
mineral at the lesion surface that forms an outer layer of
higher mineral content that serves as a barrier to the
further diffusion of ﬂuids into the body of the porous
lesion.1–3 The highly mineralized outer surface zone or
transparent surface layer (TSL) can be detected using
transverse microradiography and polarized light micros-
copy that require destruction of the tooth, or in the case
of microcomputed tomography cannot be used in vivo.
Early occlusal caries is diagnosed by visual‐tactile

methods. Radiographs are not effective for early caries
lesions that have not penetrated deep into the underlying
dentin due to the overlapping topography of the crown.
For pit and ﬁssure caries, the tactile method via probing
with an explorer showed low sensitivity and has been
found to be unreliable in its diagnosis.4 The occlusal pits
and ﬁssures are often heavily stained obscuring early
demineralization, often leading to false positives via
visual diagnosis.5–7
New non‐destructive diagnostic tools are needed that
can assess lesion activity in a single visit and monitor
changes in the activity of the lesions over time during
nonsurgical intervention. Several studies have shown that
short wavelength infrared (SWIR) imaging methods such
as optical coherence tomography (OCT) at 1310 nm and
time‐resolved reﬂectance imaging at wavelengths greater
than 1400 nm can be used to assess remineralization and
lesion activity.8–12 The purpose of this study is to test the
hypothesis that both of these SWIR imaging methods
can detect changes in lesion activity over time in vivo.
When lesions become arrested by mineral deposition
in the outer layers of the lesion forming a highly
mineralized surface zone, the diffusion of ﬂuids into the
lesion is inhibited. Therefore, the rate of water loss and the
evaporation dynamics can be related to changes in lesion
structure and porosity. Changes in ﬂuorescence loss,13–15
thermal emission, and SWIR reﬂectance10,11,16–20 have
been investigated as methods for assessing lesion severity
and activity. Normal enamel is transparent at SWIR
wavelengths,
whereas
early
demineralization
causes
increased SWIR reﬂectance due to scattering.21 Water in
the pores at the surface of the lesion absorbs the incident
SWIR light, particularly at wavelengths greater than
1400 nm, reducing surface scattering and lesion con-
trast.22,23 Loss of that water due to evaporation produces
a marked increase in reﬂectivity and lesion contrast. In
vivo studies have been reported utilizing the ﬂuorescence
loss of white spot lesions on coronal surfaces15 and
thermal imaging to assess root caries during dehydra-
tion.24 This study is the ﬁrst clinical study to employ
SWIR reﬂectance imaging during lesion dehydration to
assess lesion activity.
OCT can provide high resolution cross‐sectional
images of lesion structure noninvasively.25,26 Polarization‐
sensitive OCT (PS‐OCT) and cross polarization OCT
(CP‐OCT) utilize the polarization properties of back‐
reﬂected light to obtain additional contrast in OCT
images and reduce the interference of the strong reﬂec-
tions that occur at tooth surfaces.27–30 In vivo studies
using CP‐OCT were able to accurately detect both early
and severe occlusal lesions that were not visible on
radiographs.31,32
Several studies have demonstrated that CP‐OCT is
able to monitor remineralization on tooth surfaces by
detecting the formation of the highly mineralized TSL
on the lesion surface and a decrease in the integrated
reﬂectivity over the lesion depth (ΔR) after exposure to
a remineralization solution.8,9,33 In vitro studies have
shown that the presence of even a thin TSL of less than
20 µm
in
CP‐OCT
images
reduces
lesion
activity
signiﬁcantly.34 Removing the TSL on the lesions of
extracted teeth in turn produces a corresponding rise in
the permeability providing further conﬁrmation of the
role of the TSL in arresting lesions.35 Methods have
been developed to automatically measure the thickness
of the TSL and ΔR from CP‐OCT images.36,37 In a
previous in vivo study, CP‐OCT was used to monitor
changes in the activity of smooth surface enamel lesions
on permanent teeth.12 Even though the test subjects
recruited were required to have active lesions based on
conventional visual/tactile assessment, CP‐OCT imag-
ing indicated that most of the lesions (62/63) had TSLs
at baseline suggesting they were already arrested. CP‐
OCT images indicated there was no signiﬁcant increase
in lesion severity (ΔR) for those lesions measured after
30 weeks providing further conﬁrmation they were
indeed arrested. Primary teeth were chosen for this
study to ensure that a higher percentage of the lesions
would
be
initially
active
rather
than
arrested
to
demonstrate that changes in lesion severity and activity
can be successfully monitored. In addition, lesions
progress more rapidly in primary teeth than in perma-
nent teeth due to the thinner layer of enamel requiring
more frequent monitoring.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participant recruitment and procedures
Study participants (n = 30 with 60 primary molars) aged
6−10 were recruited from the UCSF Pediatric Dentistry
clinic by the study investigators (UCSF IRB 18‐25927).
One participant was lost to follow‐up after the ﬁrst visit
and was excluded from the study. A total of 29
participants (n = 29 with 58 primary molars) completed
the study. Participants were required to have at least two
primary teeth with suspected pit and ﬁssure caries.
Lesions with obvious cavitation, existing restorations
covering the pits and ﬁssures or severe enough to require
restorative treatment were rejected.
All 58 lesions were visually scored as a 1 in severity
according to the International Caries Detection and
Assessment System (ICDAS).38 CP‐OCT and SWIR
imaging showed that 6 of the lesions were likely false
positives since no demineralization was observed in the
images at any of the three time‐points. Color images of
each tooth were acquired at the initial visit and at month‐
6 using a FocusDent MD740 1280 × 960‐pixel intraoral
camera. Fluoride varnish was applied to all lesions at
3‐month intervals over a period of 6‐months to promote
remineralization. In addition, the participants were given
a ﬂuoride toothpaste with 0.76% monoﬂuorophosphate
and instructed to brush twice a day.

Time‐resolved SWIR reﬂectance imaging at
1400−1750 nm
An image of the fully assembled SWIR reﬂectance
imaging device is shown in Figure 1A along with
diagrams of the 3D printed probe and it's components.
The reﬂectance probe was designed in Fusion 360 from
Autodesk and 3D printed using a Form 3 printer from
Formlabs. The reﬂectance probe body consists of a
right‐angle aluminum mirror to collect light from the
occlusal surface and an attachment for the reﬂectance
ﬁber.39 A low‐OH optical ﬁber of 1 mm diameter ﬁber is
inserted into a cylindrical Teﬂon plug (3.2 × 40 mm).
Light exiting the plug is directed toward the tooth
occlusal surface. There is an air nozzle attached to the
reﬂectance body near the mirror to prevent fogging of
the mirror and dehydrate the lesion surface to assess
lesion activity.10,11,20 The SWIR reﬂectance images were
captured using a 640 × 480‐pixel micro‐SWIR camera
(SU640CSX)
measuring
only
32 x 32 x 28 mm
from
Sensors Unlimited. Two planoconvex antireﬂection
coated lenses of 60 and 100 mm focal length along with
an adjustable aperture were placed between the hand-
piece and the InGaAs camera to provide a ﬁeld of view
of 11 mm2 at the focus plane. SWIR light from a
compact tungsten halogen lamp Model SLS201 from
Thorlabs with a 1400 nm long‐pass ﬁlter illuminated the
occlusal surfaces.
Images were recorded at 4 Hz for the 30 s time
window at 0 and 6‐months and imported into MATLAB
for further analysis. Proﬁles of intensity versus time were
extracted from the mean intensity of a 5 × 5‐pixel region
of interest that was manually selected. Lesions were
designated as active or arrested based on the presence of
a transparent surface zone (TSL) from the corresponding
CP‐OCT images. Unpaired t‐tests were used to compare
SWIR data between suspected arrested and active
lesions.
CP‐OCT
The CP‐OCT system used for this study was the Model
IVS‐3000‐CP purchased from Santec. It operates at a
wavelength of 1321 nm with a bandwidth of 111 nm
(11.4 µm axial‐resolution) and it is capable of acquiring
complete tomographic images 6 x 6 x 7 mm in approxi-
mately 3 s. Images of the CP‐OCT handpiece are shown
in Figure 1B. It has been used for multiple in vivo caries
imaging studies.12,30,32
An appliance made of autoclavable Dental SG resin
printed using a 3D printer, Formlabs 2 was placed on
the distal end of the OCT scanning handpiece and the
handpiece was covered with polyethylene ﬁlm for
infection control. Air at 10 psi was connected to the

to the miniature InGaAs camera. Labeled diagrams of the probe body
and two additional 3D printed components are also shown, where (1) is

another 3D printed component ﬁts over the end of the probe body and
makes contact with the tooth surface and functions as a bite block (6).

Images were imported into Dragonﬂy from ORS soft-
ware for coregistration and analysis. A 3D Median ﬁlter
was applied to reduce speckle noise in the images
followed by 3D image registration to superimpose the
lesion areas for all three visits. Images from the same
sample at different visits also went through intensity
normalization before quantitative measurement. The
integrated reﬂectivity over the lesion depth (ΔR) which
best represents the lesion severity was calculated by
positioning a box within the lesion dimensions, calcu-
lating the mean pixel intensity in the box and multi-
plying by the lesion depth. Lesion depth (Ld) was
measured on the registered lesion areas at the position
of the maximum depth of the lesion. Lesion activity was
evaluated as binary (arrested or active) based on
detection of a TSL after image‐processing. The TSL
was measured along a ruler drawn at the center of the
lesion orthogonal to the surface. All arrested lesions
have TSLs measured as the distance between two
adjacent intensity peaks (surface reﬂection from top of
TSL to lesion underneath) measured after ﬁltering.
Statistical comparisons between suspected active and
arrested lesion areas were performed in GraphPad
Prism. RM‐ANOVA with Tukey−Kramer multiple
comparisons test was used to compare the CP‐OCT
data at 0, 3, & 6‐months.
RESULTS
Out of the 30 test subjects recruited, 29 test subjects
completed the study. Suspected lesions on 2 teeth were
monitored on each test subject. Six of the remaining 58
lesions were determined to be sound since no lesions were
visible in the CP‐OCT images at any time points. A
further 10 lesions were disqualiﬁed due to the inability to
coregister the CP‐OCT lesions at all three time‐points
yielding an CP‐OCT sample size of 42 lesions. Visual
monitoring indicated no changes in ICDAS scores for
any of the lesions after 6‐months.
Color
and
CP‐OCT
images
extracted
from
2
suspected active lesions, one that remained active and
progressed further in depth and severity and a second
lesion that became arrested are shown in Figure 2. The
ﬁrst lesion shows an increase in Ld and ΔR over 6
months with no TSL visible at the surface. CP‐OCT
images show a continual advance of the lesion in depth
and area over time. In the second lesion example, a TSL
is clearly visible at 3‐months and after 6‐months and the
depth of the lesion has not appeared to increase
signiﬁcantly suggesting that it progressed from an active
to arrested state (became arrested). The color images in
Figure 2 show no changes in appearance between 0 and
6‐months for either lesion.
Three parameters were calculated for each of the 42
lesions at each of the three time points from the CP‐OCT
data. The lesion depth in microns (Ld), the lesion
reﬂectivity integrated over the lesion depth (ΔR), and
the thickness of the transparent surface zone (TSL) in
microns. The mean ± SD for each measurement are
plotted in Figure 3. There were signiﬁcant increases
(p < 0.05) in the mean Ld and ΔR over the 6‐month
period for the 42 lesions. This suggests that most of the
42 lesions remained active and progressed in severity
over the 6‐month period. There were large increases in
the mean TSL thickness for each 3‐month period
indicating that several of the lesions did indeed become
arrested or remained arrested. At 6‐months 14 of the 42
lesions manifested a distinct TSL indicating they were
arrested. Six of the lesions had a TSL at month‐0 and all
6 retained it over 6‐months. The mean TSL thickness
increased from 21 ± 25 (baseline month‐0) to 115 ± 51
(month‐6). Eight additional lesions formed new TSL's
over 6‐months and the TSL thickness increased signiﬁ-
cantly for the 6 arrested lesions from 49 ± 12 (month‐0)
to 150 ± 43 (month‐6). Of the 14 lesions that had
measurable TSLs at 6‐months all 14 showed decreases
in lesion severity (ΔR) from 0 to 6‐months.
Analysis of the SWIR reﬂectance images at 0 and
6‐months was more difﬁcult than anticipated and only 48
of
the
116
acquired
videos
were
processed.
Two
parameters were calculated from the acquired time
versus intensity curves, the change in intensity with
drying (ΔI) and the initial delay before the rise in
reﬂectivity (DEL). The 48 SWIR videos were separated
into two groups deﬁned as active and arrested based on
the absence or presence of a TSL on the lesion. Due to
the low number of lesions with TSLs, month‐0 and 6
SWIR reﬂectance images were pooled together to yield 8
arrested videos and 40 active videos. There was a large
and signiﬁcant difference (p < 0.05) in the mean +/− SD
for (DEL) 16 ± 8.9 versus 4.3 ± 5.1 s for active versus
arrested lesions. For active lesions (ΔI) was higher,
18 ± 11 versus 13 ± 11 for active versus arrested lesions
but the difference was not signiﬁcant, (p > 0.05).
Figure 4A shows time‐sequenced SWIR images of
matched areas of the occlusal surface recorded during
the 30 s of drying at 0 and 6‐months. There is a very
small lesion in the occlusal pit that was active at
baseline and arrested at month‐6 that can be seen in the
CP‐OCT images shown in Figure 4B along with color
pictures of the area imaged in the SWIR. Proﬁles of the
SWIR reﬂectance intensity are shown in Figure 4C
extracted from the lesion area and a peripheral sound
area during drying. The “active” lesion (month 0) shows
a large delay of more than 20 s before a rapid rise in
reﬂectivity as expected for an active lesion. The arrested
lesion (month‐0) manifests almost no delay before a
more gradual rise in reﬂectivity as expected for an
arrested lesion. However, since the rise in reﬂectivity
occurs very late for the month‐0 curve it is unclear
whether all the changes in that curve were captured in
the 30 s that were recorded.

DISCUSSION
This study was successful in recruiting a majority of test
subjects with active lesions by choosing recently erupted
primary teeth. Even though only a small number of those
lesions that were initially active became arrested after 6
months with “lesion arrest” deﬁned as the formation of a
TSL
measurable
using
CP‐OCT,
the
number
was
sufﬁcient to show a statistically signiﬁcant increase
(p < 0.0001) in the TSL thickness over time. Comparison
of this study consisting of mainly “active” lesions in
which no TSL was present at baseline (36/42) with a
previous study on permanent teeth where most lesions
(62/63) had TSLs at baseline and there were no
signiﬁcant changes in lesion severity over 30‐weeks12
provides further conﬁrmation that the TSL thickness is a
key objective indicator of lesion activity. Furthermore,
the TSL thickness provides a measure of the lesion
activity that can be made at a single time‐point. The
mean TSL thickness for the 63 lesions at month‐6 from
the previous study was 184 ± 56 compared to 115 ± 51 for
this
study.
The
thickness
was
signiﬁcantly
higher

(p < 0.0001, unpaired t‐test) for the lesions on the
permanent teeth in the previous study as would be
expected for lesions that had a greater time to undergo
remineralization. This is consistent with previous studies
of age‐related differences in lesion structure based on
histopathology.3
These two studies also show the poor reliability of
visual/tactile indicators of lesion activity and severity
such as color and texture. Active lesions were a
recruitment criterion for both studies and out of the
111 primary and permanent teeth recruited for the two
clinical studies only 37 were active according to CP‐OCT
imaging, 6 were sound and 69 were arrested and those 76
sites manifested no further change increase in severity
over 6‐months while the other suspected active lesions
either progressed in severity (n = 28) or became arrested
(n = 7).
Moreover,
visual
monitoring
with
ICDAS
indicated
no
changes
in
any
of
the
lesions
over
6‐months for either study further conﬁrming the low
sensitivity of conventional visual monitoring.
In this study, there was a signiﬁcant increase of the
lesion depth (Ld) and the integrated reﬂectivity (ΔR)
over the 6‐month period suggesting that most of the
lesions did not become arrested and actually progressed
in severity. In vitro studies suggest that ΔR should
decrease if all of the lesions become arrested and undergo
major remineralization.8,9,33 As mineral is deposited into
the lesion due to remineralization the overall reﬂectivity
of the lesion decreases yielding a net decrease in ΔR.
However, we observed TSL's in only 14 of the 42 lesions
at 6‐months indicating that only 1/3 of the lesions
underwent enough remineralization to appear arrested.
Therefore, the increases in ΔR and Ld are consistent with
the majority of lesions remaining active during the
duration of the study.
This was the ﬁrst clinical study in which SWIR
reﬂectance imaging was employed to assess lesion activity.
Based on in vitro studies it was anticipated that (ΔI) the
overall change in intensity would be signiﬁcantly higher
for active lesions versus arrested lesions.10,34,40,41 How-
ever, the time required for drying was much higher than
encountered for in vitro studies and many of the active
lesions did not sufﬁciently dry in 30 s.41 This inﬂuenced
the ability to observe the full change in intensity for
accurate calculation of (ΔI). For example, in Figure 4C
the rise in intensity did not occur until after 20 s so it is
unlikely that the ΔI calculated from that curve is reliable.
The dehydration curves were also much noisier than
expected making curve ﬁtting difﬁcult. These problems
can be addressed in future studies by further increasing the
air pressure and by further optimization of the air ﬂow
geometry in the probe to better penetrate the occlusal ﬁts
and ﬁssures. The delay in the onset of the intensity change
(DEL) appeared to be a better indicator of lesion activity
than ΔI for this study. This onset delay (DEL) was
ignored in early in vitro studies and was only recently
discovered to be an indicator of lesion activity.10,34,40,41
For active lesions there are exposed pores in the outer
layer of the lesion, when those pores are ﬁlled with ﬂuid
they absorb the SWIR light lowering the reﬂectivity from
the lesion. When the ﬂuid is removed from the pores

ASSESSING LESION ACTIVITY WITH SWIR IMAGING

during drying the reﬂectivity rises. Arrested lesions have
an outer highly mineralized TSL of low porosity with
minimal ﬂuid present between the lesion body and the
surface so there is minimal delay before there is a rise in
reﬂectivity during drying.41 It appears that this onset delay
(DEL) is a good indicator of lesion activity that can be
easily measured in vivo. It is desirable to be able to extract
multiple indicators of lesion activity from the SWIR
reﬂectivity versus time curves during drying as has been
possible in in vitro studies where the curves were ﬁt to
extract additional information about the rate of increase
in the reﬂectivity,41 not just DEL and ΔI as was done in
this study and we plan on further development of the
SWIR reﬂectance imaging handpiece for more rapid
dehydration of the lesions.
Both OCT and SWIR imaging were done in contact
with the tooth surface to minimize motion artifacts. Even
so, several scans had to be repeated due to excessive
movement during scanning for both OCT and SWIR
reﬂectance imaging. In the case of SWIR imaging many
of the image frames had to be corrected due to slight
movement during the 30 s.
This study was not intended to be a clinical trial of
ﬂuoride varnish, therefore a non‐ﬂuoride varnish control
group was not used. Fluoride varnish was applied
because it was the standard of care for patients of high
caries risk and it was likely to increase the probability
that more active lesions would undergo remineralization
and become arrested.
CONCLUSION
This was the ﬁrst clinical study to monitor changes in
lesion structure and activity in primary teeth over time in
vivo using CP‐OCT and SWIR Imaging. The formation
of a TSL at the surface of active lesions indicative of
lesion arrest was observed using CP‐OCT on multiple
lesions. In addition, this was the ﬁrst clinical study to use
SWIR reﬂectance imaging to show differences in the
dehydration
dynamics
between
active
and
arrested
lesions.

SWIR reﬂectance and CP‐OCT images of another suspected active lesion that appears to become arrested at 6‐months. (A) Time‐
sequence SWIR images of the lesion area from 0 to 30 s at 0 and 6‐months are shown during drying. Lesion area is in yellow box and sound area is in
the blue box. (B) CP‐OCT scans at 0 and 6‐months show a small pit and ﬁssure lesion (L), the white bar represents 500 μm. Color images of the
occlusal surface at 0 and 6‐months are inset in each image and the lesion area monitored by SWIR is indicated by the yellow box. (C) The SWIR
reﬂectance intensity is plotted between with time at 0 and 6‐months at the lesion position shown by the small yellow boxes inset in the SWIR images
at 30 s (yellow) and for adjacent sound areas (blue). CP‐OCT, cross polarization optical coherence tomography; SWIR, short wavelength infrared
