Abstract  
43 
To date, there is no high-quality sequence for genomes of the East Asian grape 
44 
species, hindering biological and breeding research efforts to improve grape 
45 
cultivars. This study presents a ~522 Mb of the Vitis amurensis (Va) genome 
46 
sequence containing 27,635 coding genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that 
47 
V. riparia (Vr) may firstly split from the other two species, Va, V. Vinifera (Vv; 
48 
Pinot Noir: PN40024 and Cabernet Sauvignon). Much divergent gene 
49 
reservation among three grape duplicated gene sets suggests that the core eudicot 
50 
common hexaploidy (ECH), 130 million years ago (Mya), has still played a 
51 
non-negligible role in grape species divergence and biological innovation. 
52 
Prominent accumulation of sequence variants might have improved cold 
53 
resistance in Va, resulting in a more robust cold resistance gene regulatory

network than those in Vv and Vr. In contrast, Va preserved much fewer NBS 
55 
disease resistance genes than the other grapes. Notably, multi-omics analysis 
56 
identified one trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase gene positively correlated to 
57 
the resveratrol accumulated during Va berry development. A selective sweep 
58 
analysis revealed a hypothetical Va sex-determination region (SDR). Besides, a 
59 
PPR-containing protein-coding gene in the hypothetical SDR may be related 
60 
with sex determination in Va. The content and arrangement order of genes in the 
61 
putative SDR of female Va were similar to the SDR of female Vv. However, the 
62 
putative SDR of female Va lost one Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO) 
63 
and contained one extra uncharacterized protein-coding gene. These findings 
64 
will improve the understanding of Vitis biology and contribute to the 
65 
improvement of grape breeding.

Introduction 
71 
Grape genus (Vitis) contain about 60 species of vining plants. Eurasian grape, 
72 
East Asian grape, American grape, and other intergeneric hybrid grapes are 
73 
some of the most common grape varieties globally (Foria et al., 2022). 
74 
As a wild plant, originated in eastern Asia, Amur grape (Vitis amurensis), 
75 
also called "Chinese wild grape" or "Shanputao" (Wang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 
76 
2021), is one of the East Asian grape species, resembling the wine grape (one of 
77 
the Eurasian grapes). Wild Amur grapes are mainly found in the Yellow River 
78 
basin and Songhua River basin in China, Siberia in Russia, Korea, Japan, and 
79 
many other areas around the world (Chen et al., 2018). Amur grapes have 
80 
female, male, or bisexual plants (Figure 1b-d). The Latin name “Vitis amurensis 
81 
Rupr.” of the Amur grape was first proposed in 1857 by botanist Franz Josef

Ruprecht, and the cultivation of Vitis amurensis can be traced back to 1907 
83 
(wine-world.com). A female Amur grape cultivated variant (cv), called 
84 
“Zuoshan No. 1” is vastly planted in the Northern China. A bisexual Amur grape 
85 
cv. “Shuangyou” is also widely cultivated. 
86 
Amur grape has huge commercial potential, for containing abundant 
87 
phenolic compounds, procyanidins, oligostilbenes, and stilbenes (Chen et al., 
88 
2018). Its fruits are dark purple with small berries, more acidic than Vv, and are 
89 
used as raw materials for claret, sweet red wine, semi-dry wine, semisweet red 
90 
wine, and brandy (wine-world.com). Young twigs of the Amur grape have spider 
91 
silk-like hairs (Figure 1a). Amur grape is extremely cold-tolerant and can 
92 
survive temperatures as low as -40°C (Wan et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2014). Now, 
93 
Amur grape has become a valuable germplasm resource for grape breeding and 
94 
wine production. Cv. “Beibinghong”, a cross of Vitis amurensis and Vitis 
95 
vinifera, is a good example in cold resistance, having ability to tolerate 
96 
temperatures of -37 °C and therefore used for preparing fancy red ice wine. 
97 
Recent pharmacological studies showed that Amur grape possesses 
98 
anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties (Chen 
99 
et al., 2018).  
100 
The genome sequence of Vitis Vinifera cv. “Pinot Noir (PN40024)”, a kind 
101 
of Eurasian grape species, was deciphered (Jaillon et al., 2007; Canaguier et al., 
102 
2017) and has been used as the standard grape genome for grapes' gene analyses 
103 
(Liang et al., 2019; Ma et al. 2018). A high-quality genome sequence of Vv cv. 
104 
Cabernet Sauvignon was sequenced in 2021 with the Hi-C technology. The 
105 
genome for V. riparia, an American grape species, was recently decoded 
106 
(Girolletet al., 2019). Va IBCAS1988 genome was sequenced in 2021 with a 
107 
genome size 604.56 Mb and N50 282,256 bp (Wang et al., 2021). To date, there 
108 
is no high-quality sequence for genomes of the East Asian grape species, 
109 
hindering biological and breeding research efforts to improve grape cultivars.

Here, we present a high-quality sequence for the Vitis amurensis cv. “Zuoshan 
111 
No.1” genome. The availability of the genome sequence of Amur grape will lay 
112 
a solid foundation to understand grape biology and develop new breeding lines, 
113 
by deepening our insight into grapes' evolution and genetic variability, the 
114 
molecular basis for cold adaptation and sex determination of grapes, etc.

Results 
117 
A high-quality Amur grape reference genome 
118 
The study used the female Amur grape “Zuoshan No.1” (Figure 1E-G) as the 
119 
material. The Amur grape genome sequence was de novo assembled with 52.69 
120 
Gb (~101.46 fold coverage) of Nanopore reads, 98.79 Gb (~189.23 fold 
121 
coverage) of MGISEQ short reads, and 58.12 Gb (~111.34 fold coverage) of 
122 
Hi-C data. A k-mer analysis of Illumina reads estimated the Amur grape genome 
123 
to be ~532 Mb, with DNA heterozygosity 1.20% (Table 1). The final assembled 
124 
genome sequence reached to ~522 Mb, covering ~97.5% of the estimated 
125 
genome (BUSCO value = 97.5), with a GC content 0.345 (Table 1). Moreover, 
126 
the assembly comprised 56 contigs with 2.5 Mb of contig N50. The N50 of Va 
127 
IBCAS1988 is much shorter (282,256 bp) (Wang et al., 2021) than that of the 
128 
Va Zuoshan No.1 genome, suggesting quality differences in the genome 
129 
assemblies. The resultant 615 contigs accounted for 98.31% (~513.47Mb) of the 
130 
total assembled genome, anchored onto 19 pseudo-chromosomes using Hi-C 
131 
reads (Figure 2A and B). Repetitive elements accounts for 59.21% of the 
132 
genome sequence (Table 1), much higher than the finding (47.06%) in Va 
133 
IBCAS1988 genome (Wang et al., 2021). 
134 
We predicted 27,635 protein-coding genes using an integrative strategy 
135 
combining de novo gene prediction, protein-based homology search, and 
136 
transcript data from RNA sequences of various tissues. The ~96.4% of annotated 
137 
protein-coding genes could be annotated by at least one public database

139 
Moreover, 231 miRNAs, 651 tRNAs, 291 rRNAs, and 412 snRNAs were 
140 
annotated. LTR accounts for the largest proportion of transposable elements, 
141 
making up ~46.39% of the genome. 
142 
The homologous gene dotplotting analysis showed a big difference in 
143 
arrangement order of homologous genes between the Va Zuoshan No.1 and Va 
144 
IBCAS1988 genomes (Figure S1). Moreover, homologous gene dotplots and 
145 
chromosome synteny analysis showed highly similar arrangement order of 
146 
homologous genes across Va Zuoshan No.1, Vv PN40024, Vv Cabernet 
147 
Sauvignon, and Vr genomes (Figure 2C-E). Va has large inversions on 
148 
chromosomes 3, 9, 10, and 18 relative to Vv and Vr (Figure 2D, E). Besides, Va 
149 
IBCAS1988 chromosomes have large inversions on Va Zuoshan No.1 
150 
chromosomes 1, 5, 15, 16, 18, and 19 (Figure S1). The homologous gene 
151 
dotplots also showed a major difference between Va IBCAS1988 and Va 
152 
Zuoshan No.1 genomes on chromosome 13. The homologous region between 
153 
chromosome 13 of Va IBCAS1988 and Va Zuoshan No.1 is clearly divided into 
154 
two parts. The anterior part of chromosome 13 (~19.6 Mb) of Va IBCAS1988 is 
155 
homologous to the posterior part of Va Zuoshan No.1 chromosome while the 
156 
posterior part of Va IBCAS1988 chromosome is homologous to the anterior part 
157 
of Va Zuoshan No.1 chromosome (~12.6 Mb) (Figure S1). Previous studies on 
158 
the Va IBCAS1988 genome indicated a major difference between Va 
159 
IBCAS1988 and Vv PN40024 on chromosome 13 (Wang et al., 2021). Here, we 
160 
found a minimal difference between Va Zuoshan No.1 and Vv PN40024 on 
161 
chromosome 13 (Figure 2C). 
162 
In order to discover the differences between the previous genome and our 
163 
genome. The “putative structural variation (SV) analysis” of genomes based on 
164 
the genome alignment showed big differences in the genome structures between 
165 
Va IBCAS1988 and Va Zuoshan No.1 genomes. This study identified 171

inversions (95.46Mb), 794 translocations (9.86 Mb), and 481 duplications 
167 
(3.41Mb) (Table S2) between the Amur grape Zuoshan No.1 and Va 
168 
IBCAS1988 genomes. The SV analysis of the genome alignment proved the 
169 
large inversions on chromosomes 1, 5, 15, 16, 18, and 19 shown by the 
170 
homologous gene dot plots. Moreover, the SV analysis also indicated large 
171 
inversions on chromosomes 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, and 17. However, the 122 
172 
duplications between the Amur grape Zuoshan No.1 and Va IBCAS1988 
173 
genomes involved 97 protein-coding genes. The 99 translocations between the 
174 
Amur grape and Va IBCAS1988 genomes involved 82 protein-coding genes. 
175 
As to the SNPs, a total of 1,382,913 SNPs were identified between two Va 
176 
cultivars, Zuoshan No.1 and IBCAS1988 (Table S2), including 10,733 
177 
protein-coding genes. Besides, a total of 379,188 indels were identified, with 
178 
insertions affecting 7654 protein-coding genes, and deletions 8356 ones.  
179 
The Amur grape Zuoshan No.1 genome had 12018 genomic-specific segments 
180 
(17.51 Mb), and the Va IBCAS1988 had 8465 genomic-specific segments 
181 
(12.25 Mb), including 2271 Va-specific PAV (presence-absence variation) and 
182 
237 Va IBCAS1988 specific PAV genes (Table S3). Many Va Zuoshan 
183 
No.1-specific PAV genes include pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein 
184 
and TF genes (Table S4). Many Va IBCAS1988-specific PAV genes include 
185 
hypothetical protein genes (Table S5).

Duplicated genes produced by the core-eudicot-common hexaploidy (ECH) 
189 
(Jaillon et al., 2007), common to major core eudicot, may have contributed to the 
190 
divergence of the species. We found that Vr contains more duplicated genes 
191 
(5231, 20.04%) than Va (4494, 16.26%) and Vv (3993, 12.49%) (Table S2), 
192 
showing 800-1300 duplicated gene composition difference. This should have

been caused by unbalanced gene losses in the ECH-produced regions.

Polyploidization was anticipated to result in genome instability, characterized by 
195 
extensive DNA rearrangements and gene losses, especially in the early days after 
196 
the tripling of the genome. Notably, the present finding suggest much divergent 
197 
evolutionary patterns among these grapes and the ECH, as ancient as 130 million 
198 
years ago (Mya), played and has still played a non-negligible role in grape 
199 
species divergence and biological innovation. 
200 
The Ks distribution of duplicated genes generated by the ECH shows an up 
201 
to 3.2% difference in their evolutionary rates. Vv, Vr, and Va, had peaks located 
202 
at 1.29 (+/- 0.150), 1.27 (+/-0.165), and 1.25 (+/- 0.135), respectively, indicating 
203 
that Va evolved the slowest among the three species (ANOVA, P Value=0.023) 
204 
(Figure 3a, Supplementary Table 7). The Ks peaks derived from the orthologous 
205 
gene pairs between species were located around 0.026 (Figure 3b, Table S3). 
206 
Considering the proposed occurrence time of the ECH, and the Ks between 
207 
paralogous generated by each grape ECH event was ~1.25 (Figure 3a), we 
208 
calculated the three species should have diverged ~2.3-2.8 Mya based on the Ks 
209 
between orthologous of every two grapes was ~0.025-0.026 (Figure 3b). 
210 
By using the concatenated multiple sequence alignment of single-copy 
211 
genes (5929) inferred by Orthofinder, between the three Vitis genomes and 
212 
Aquilegia coerulea, acting as an outgroup, a phylogenetic tree was constructed 
213 
and showed that the Va was more closer to Vv in evolution history (Figure 3C). 
214 
When Arabidopsis or Boxwood was used as an outgroup, we obtained the same 
215 
inference (Figure S2). 
216 
The SVs analysis revealed large DNA inversions on Va chromosomes 3, 9, 
217 
10, and 18, relative to Vv (both Cabernet Sauvignon and PN40024) and Vr, 
218 
consistent with the homologous gene dotplots (Figure 2; Figure 4; Figure S3). 
219 
Large DNA rearrangements contributed to the divergence of different grapes. 
220 
DNA rearrangements in Vitis chromosomes 19 were inferred across the three 
221 
species, large inversions were found between the Vr and Vv chromosomes 3, 7,

and 18, especially one large DNA segmental translocation was detected on Vr 
223 
and Vv chromosome 18 (Figure 4; Figure S3).  
224 
Genome instability due to the ECH resulted in species-specific regions, 
225 
further contributing to their biological divergence. A comparison of Va and Vv 
226 
showed that Amur grape had 12105 specific genomic segments, accumulated to 
227 
15.46 Mb, whereas Vv had 8465 (11.73 Mb), with 1609 Va-specific PAV genes 
228 
and 79 Vv-specific PAV genes positioned within these specific genomic 
229 
segments (Table S4). The Va-specific PAV genes include those respectively 
230 
encoding cold-responsive protein kinase 1, ethylene-responsive transcription 
231 
factor, flavonoid 3’,5’-hydroxylase 2, DELLA2, heat shock 70 kDa protein, 
232 
methyl-CpG-binding domain protein, and WRKY transcription factor 14 genes 
233 
(Table S5). In contrast, Vv-specific PAV genes contain several uncharacterized 
234 
genes (Table S6). We found 16 Va-specific PAV genes were cold resistance 
235 
related genes. The enriched GO terms of Va-specific PAV genes (P<0.05) 
236 
comprise monolayer-surrounded lipid storage body (GO:0012511) and stress 
237 
fiber (GO:0001725). The enriched KEGG pathway of Va-specific PAV genes 
238 
(P<0.05) comprise Calcium signaling pathway (ko04020), and phosphonate and 
239 
phosphinate metabolism (ko00440).  
240 
A comparison of Amur grape and Vr genomes found that Va had 7142 
241 
specific genomic segments (6.53 Mb), while Vr had 3489 segments (7.68 Mb), 
242 
including 266 Va-specific (Table S7) and 88 Vr-specific PAV genes (Table S8). 
243 
We found the Vitis03G0393, Vitis11G0466, Vitis16G0074, Vitis14G1585, and 
244 
Vitis05G0085 from Va-specific PAV genes were cold resistance related genes. 
245 
The enriched GO terms of Va-specific PAV genes (P<0.05) comprise negative 
246 
regulation of stomatal complex development (GO:2000122), regulation of

We identified 349 cold resistance related genes (CRGs) in Va, 437 in Vv 
255 
and 404 in Vr, accounting 1.26%, 1.37% and 1.01% of the total number of 
256 
genes in each genome, respectively. An in silico interaction network of key cold 
257 
resistance related genes in Va, Vv, and Vr was constructed as previously 
258 
described (Song et al., 2020). Though having the fewest CRG genes in Va, a 
259 
research into the robustness of CRG regulatory networks showed that Va CRG 
260 
regulatory network was more robust in Va than those in Vv and Vr (Table 2).  
261 
In addition to cold resistance related genes, we studied disease resistance 
262 
genes. We identified totally 64 nucleotide binding site (NBS) genes in Va, 
263 
which is less than in Vv (158 NBS family genes) and in Vr (172 NBS family 
264 
genes). 34 Va NBS family genes (53.13% of Va NBS genes) were related to the 
265 
ECH and 42 (65.63% of Va NBS family genes) were related to the tandem 
266 
duplication. The Ks value of 4 pairs Va NBS genes is less than 0.025 (Figure 
267 
S4), showing likely being generated after divergence of Va from the other 
268 
grape species. We found 151 ancestral vitis NBS family genes based on the 
269 
collinear relationship across three grapes and A. coerulea and also found that 
270 
124 of the ancestral NBS genes were lost in Va. In contrast, Vv lost 57 and Vr 
271 
lost 54 genes. The evolutionary tree of NBS genes supports this viewpoint. 
272 
Figure S5 showed in many branches which existed more than one Vv or Vr 
273 
genes contain one or none Va gene.

Berries of Va are nutrient-richand contain many phenolic compounds, such as 
278 
anthocyanins and procyanidins, and stilbenes such as resveratrol (Chen et al., 
279 
2018). Besides, Va berries can be used in wine making because it is rich in 
280 
sugars and organic acids. 
281 
To reveal the molecular mechanisms of nutrient accumulation in Va cv. 
282 
Zuoshan No.1 berries, we profiled the RNA-seq (Table 3) and calculated the 
283 
gene expression changes of key biological pathways during grape development, 
284 
and correlated the gene expression changes and metabolite accumulation. Four 
285 
development stages of berries, including Stage1 (S1, late period of berry 
286 
expansion), Stage 2 (S2, Veraison), Stage 3 (S3, the period when berries change 
287 
color completely), and Stage 4 (S4, maturity stage) (Figure 5a) were analyzed. 
288 
The total sugar content increased significantly, and titratable acidity content 
289 
was decreased significantly from S1 to S4 (Figure S6). Widely targeted 
290 
metabolomics analysis showed that succinic acid and 2-isopropyl malic acid 
291 
contents decreased significantly from S1 to S4. However, there was no 
292 
significant change in tartaric acid content in berries at the four stages. 
293 
Widely targeted metabolomics analysis showed that the content of 
294 
D-glucose, a monosaccharide, significantly increased between S1 and S4. 
295 
Trehalose and sucrose, two disaccharides, significantly increased at S3.  
296 
Here, RNA-seq analysis is used for joint analysis with the widely targeted 
297 
metabolomic analysis. Two starch and sucrose metabolism pathway (Ko00500)

In

307 
beta-fructofuranosidase (Vitis16G0541) was significantly down-regulated (fold

309 
(sucrose-6-phosphatase 
(Vitis08G0202)), 
sucrose-phosphate 
synthase 
310 
(Vitis05G0995 and Vitis18G2061), trehalose synthesis (alpha, alpha-trehalase

gene (Vitis02G0204)) were significantly up-regulated. In contrast, sucrose 
312 
metabolism-related 
genes 
(beta-fructofuranosidase, 
Vitis16G0541, 
and 
313 
Vitis02G0497) were significantly down-regulated at S4 than S2. 
314 
Widely targeted metabolomics analysis showed that the resveratrol content 
315 
increased significantly from S1 to S4, but there was no significant change in the 
316 
resveratrol content between berries sampled at S1 and S2. In the stilbenoid, 
317 
diarylheptanoid, and gingerol biosynthesis pathway (Ko00945), stilbene 
318 
synthase competitively convert the p-Coumaroyl-CoA synthesized by 
319 
trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase to resveratrol. In contrast, shikimate 
320 
O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase 
and 
5-O-(4-coumaroyl)-D-quinate 
321 
3'-monooxygenase could convert the same to caffeoylquinic acid. From S1 to

to 
S3, 
the 
trans-cinnamate

content of caffeoylquinic acid decreased significantly, while the resveratrol

336 
showed that the trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase gene (Vitis06G0746),

related to the resveratrol content, and shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase

Exploring Amur grape “putative sex-determining region (SDR)” 
350 
A previous study showed that Vv SDR is located on the segment between 
351 
4,801,876 bp and 5,061,548 bp on chromosome 2 and involves 15 
352 
protein-encoding genes (Massonnet et al., 2020). The 5’ terminus of the SDR 
353 
segment has a PPR-containing protein-coding gene and the 3’terminus has an 
354 
APT3 gene (Massonnet et al., 2020). Another study showed the SDR is located 
355 
on the segment between 4,810,929 bp and 4,921,949 bp on chromosome 2 
356 
which overlapped with the previous SDR region (Badouin et al.,2020). We 
357 
explored the Vv SDR syntenic region between 5055465 and 5198824 on Amur 
358 
grape chromosome 2, showing good synteny between two species. To 
359 
determine whether the Amur grape putative SDR region is related to sex, we

adopted the selective sweep method, which allows analysis of fewer samples 
361 
than GWAS (Kim et al., 2020). 
362 
Through re-sequencing and analyzing SNPs in 24 Amur grape individuals, 
363 
including five male, ten female, and nine hermaphroditic individuals (including 
364 
four tetraploids), we performed phylogeny analysis and examined genetic 
365 
population structure among the Amur plants (Table S9). A set of 2588125 
366 
high-quality SNPs were inferred and explored to characterize the relationship 
367 
among these 24 Va individuals and the Va reference genome (this study). A 
368 
phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the SNPs of the 24 Va individuals 
369 
and indicated that the individuals could be divided into two groups. However, 
370 
the grouping proved unrelated to sex division (Figure 6A). Then, a genetic 
371 
population structure analysis was performed and showed that the individuals 
372 
could be divided into two groups, and the grouping pattern proved unrelated to 
373 
sex division, either (Figure 6B). Alternatively, based on the SNPs in the SDR 
374 
regions of the 24 individuals, we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree. Notably, we 
375 
found that the tree had groups consistent to sex division (Figure 6C). Grossly, 
376 
the above analysis showed that the genetic relationship at the population level is 
377 
not related to sex division, while the SNP difference in SDR regions is related to 
378 
gender.  
379 
Therefore, a selective sweep analysis was performed according to the sex 
380 
groups rather than the population structure. One of the selected regions inferred 
381 
(both θπ ratios and FST in the top 5% range) from the comparison of male and 
382 
female accessions totally overlapped the Amur grape putative SDR. We found 
383 
that the Amur grape putative SDR contains 16 genes (Vitis02G0494,

(Figure 6D). However, none of the selected regions inferred between female and

(VvYABBY3), 
a

(Skewed5),

399 
a WRKY transcription factor, and an Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase

(VviAPT3). The SDR of Vv F haplotypes included genes encoding a 
401 
PPR-containing protein, a YABBY transcription factor (VviYABBY3), a 
402 
VviSKU5, a beta-fructofuranosidase, an Aldolase, a Trehalose-6-phosphate 
403 
phosphatase (TPP), an inaperturate pollen1 (VviINP1), an exostosin family 
404 
protein, a KASIII, a PLATZ transcription factor. The F haplotypes also had four 
405 
flavin-containing monooxygenases, a hypothetical protein (VviFSEX), a 
406 
WRKY transcription factor, and an Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase 
407 
(VviAPT3), respectively (Massonnet et al., 2020).   
408 
In Va, the F haplotypes included 16 genes encoding a PPR-containing 
409 
protein, a YABBY transcription factor (VviYABBY3), a VviSKU5, a 
410 
beta-fructofuranosidase, a fusion protein of aldolase and trehalose-6-phosphate

417 
haplotypes had an additional uncharacterized protein gene (Vitis02G0500) and 
418 
lost one FMO gene, as compared to the Vv Cabernet Sauvignon F haplotypes

(Figure 7).

In Vv, the female-specific DNA polymorphisms at -13, -5, and +2 bp may 
421 
reduce transcription and/or alter mRNA decay of the female PLATZ 
422 
transcription factor allele on Vv SDR (Iocco-Corena et al., 2021). However, Va 
423 
lacks these DNA polymorphisms upstream of the ATG of the PLATZ 
424 
transcription factor gene in the Amur grape putative SDR. In other words, there 
425 
is no difference of DNA polymorphisms between female, hermaphrodite, and 
426 
male Va individuals within 20 bp upstream of the PLATZ transcription factor 
427 
gene.  
428 
We found some other selected regions may be related to sex-determination 
429 
(θπ ratios and FST estimates in the top of 5%). For example, the region (chr3: 
430 
6730001bp-8840000 bp) from the comparison of male and female accessions, 
431 
the region (chr16:3565001bp-4830000bp) from the comparison of male and 
432 
female accessions, the region (chr16:15590001bp-18015000bp) from the 
433 
comparison 
of 
male 
and 
female 
accessions, 
and 
the 
region 
434 
(chr17:11450001bp-13785000bp) 
from the comparison of male and 
435 
hermaphroditic accessions. In these regions, there are the MADS-box protein 
436 
AGL62 genes (Vitis03G0709, Vitis03G0710, Vitis03G0711 and Vitis03G0712) 
437 
from chr3: 6730001bp-8840000 bp. We found that there are the 
438 
Pentatricopeptide 
repeat-containing 
protein 
genes 
in 
439 
chr16:3565001bp-4830000bp 
(Vitis16G0214

in

(Vitis16G0545), 
and 
in

chr17:11450001bp-13785000bp (Vitis17G0924). These Pentatricopeptide

Discussion 
446 
Vitis mainly include the Eurasian grape, East Asian grape, and the American 
447 
grape. The sequence of the Vv genome (PN 40024), of a Eurosian grape, was 
448 
published in 2007 (Jaillon et al., 2007) and incurred researches to understand 
449 
grape biology (Wang et al., 2018a; Wang et al., 2018b; Wang et al., 2019; 
450 
Liang et al., 2019). Given that its genome has only undergone one 
451 
polyploidization, the ECH, after split from the basal endicots, it is often used as 
452 
outgroup reference for studying the other endicot genomes (Wang et al., 
453 
2018a). The sequence of Vr RGM genome, of an American grape, was published 
454 
in 2019 (Girollet et al., 2019). The Cabernet Sauvignon genome sequence, a Vv 
455 
variety, was later published, being assembled using the Hi-C technology 
456 
(Massonnet et al., 2020).  
457 
Here, we assembled the genomes of Vitis amurensis. The above analysis 
458 
showed that the assembled Va genome sequence reported here is much 
459 
improved as to the previous one. Based on the present genome sequence, we 
460 
discovered a likely assemble error in chromosome 13 of the previous grape 
461 
genome sequence.  
462 
The availability of multiple grape genome sequences allows for comparing 
463 
and analyzing gene sequences of several grape species so that we could detect 
464 
the evolution history and other important comparative genomics information 
465 
across the grapes. In the present study, gene synteny analysis showed the 
466 
arrangement order of orthologous genes between Va, Vv, and Vr genomes are 
467 
much conservative. We have to note here, genome instability due to the ECH, as 
468 
ancient as 130 Mya, contributed to the divergence of the grape genomes. 
469 
Actually, a characterization of homologous genes showed that Vr is the most 
470 
conservative one among the three. Vr contains more paralogous genes produced 
471 
by the ECH, comparing with Va and Vv, showing the conservativeness of the Vv

genome, and implying that Vr may much resemble their common ancestor. 
473 
Moreover, more orthologous genes were preserved between Vr and the other two 
474 
grapes (Vv and Va) than between Vv and Va. Besides, phylogenetic analysis 
475 
supported that Vr was the first one to split from the other grapes. These show that 
476 
Vr genome may be taken as a better reference for Vitis biology and even all the 
477 
eudicots. The present finding that a 130-Mya polyploidization contributed to the 
478 
species divergence of grapes reminded us that it may has played a non-negligible 
479 
role in grape divergence and genetic innovation, as to a similar finding in rice 
480 
and other grasses (Wang et al., 2011). Possibly, the genomic feature of 
481 
thousands of duplicated genes in crops could be manipulated to breed high-yield 
482 
and/or high-quality crops. 
483 
Species-specific genomic segments also make up a large proportion of the 
484 
genomes for all the three species, implying significant genomic differences 
485 
among the three species. SV may generate phenotypic differences (Chawla et al., 
486 
2021), for example, Va being more cold-resistant than the other two species. 
487 
Biased sequence preservation in Va may have contributed to its capability to 
488 
resist coldness. Sequence variations, especially incurred by the ECH, may 
489 
generate phenotypic differences. Here, we found that the Va-specific PAV genes 
490 
contain cold resistance-related genes (CRG), such as those encoding the 
491 
ethylene-responsive transcription factors and cold-regulated 413 inner 
492 
membrane proteins. The robustness of CRG regulatory networks in Va is higher 
493 
than those in Vv and Vr. This showed that the stronger cold resistance of Va may 
494 
be related to the preferential preservation of cold-related genes, and Va 
495 
cold-related genes may constitute a more robust and effective interaction 
496 
network. A study of CRGs in angiosperms, including Vv, supported the 
497 
expansion of them was significantly related to the occurrence of polyploidization 
498 
(Song et al., 2020). The present study provides further evidence that the ECH,

though occurred 130-150 million ago, still contribute to enhance resistance to 
500 
coldness in plants. 
501 
Multi-omics analysis of the Va was performed to understand the mechanism 
502 
underlying the regulation of nutrient accumulation in the Vitis amurensis over its 
503 
developmental period. Va is sourer than Vv, a factor that needs urgent resolution 
504 
by breeders, in that high sourness makes the fruits taste unpleasant, and the 
505 
wine tastes unbalanced. The present analysis revealed that the total sugar 
506 
increased continuously during the “Zuoshan No.1” berry development, while the 
507 
total sugar content in this species/variety was almost equal to that in Vv. Further 
508 
analyses revealed that the total acid content decreased significantly during 
509 
“Zuoshan No.1” berry development. Wide target metabolome analysis showed 
510 
no decrease in tartaric acid content during berry of “Zuoshan No.1” 
511 
development, while those of citric acid and several malic acid types decreased 
512 
significantly in “Zuoshan No.1”. Combined transcriptome and metabolome 
513 
analyses revealed that sucrose-6-phosphatase, alpha, alph-trehalase, and beta 
514 
fructofuranosidase genes jointly regulate the accumulation of sucrose and 
515 
trehalose during “Zuoshan No.1” development. The DEGs during S1-S4 
516 
comprises the ripening-related protein-like gene and chalcone synthase gene, 
517 
which is the first enzyme activated the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (Waki et 
518 
al., 2020), UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase gene, which 
519 
promotes anthocyanin accumulation in grape (Yamazaki et al., 2021), SWEET 
520 
gene, which is a sugar transporter and uniporter gene (Chong et al., 2014), 
521 
ethylene-responsive transcription factor 3-like gene, certaining bHLH, MYB 
522 
transcription factor genes, and WD repeat-containing protein genes. Most of 
523 
these genes may be involved in Va berry ripening. Therefore, we infer that these 
524 
DEGs may play a central role in the process of Va berry ripening.   
525 
The Va genome was further analyzed to understand the relationship between 
526 
different Vitis amurensis phenotypes and genotypes. Given the scarcity of

hermaphroditic Vitis amurensis in nature, we explored the sex determination 
528 
region in this grape. Previous studies have uncovered the SDR of Vv (Massonnet 
529 
et al., 2020). The three Vv types (varieties) are determined by the genotype at the 
530 
SDR. Males are heterozygous for the male and female haplotypes (MF), females 
531 
are homozygous (FF), and cultivated Vv hermaphrodites are either homozygous 
532 
for hermaphrodite haplotypes (HH) or heterozygous (HF). Previous studies have 
533 
shown that the SDR of Vv M and H haplotypes have 2 TPR-containing protein 
534 
genes and 3 Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO), and the SDR of Vv F 
535 
haplotypes contain 4 Flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMO) without 
536 
TPR-containing protein gene (Massonnet et al., 2020). This implies that the type 
537 
or number of genes in the SDR of grapes vary between sexes.  
538 
Further analyses to clarify whether SDR is also present in Va revealed that 
539 
one fragment from Va is homologous to Vv SDR in Vitis amurensis and call it 
540 
the Amur grape putative SDR. In the present study, we sequenced the female Va 
541 
genome. Therefore, further analyses were performed to explore whether the 
542 
types and numbers of genes in female Va putative SDR were consistent with 
543 
those in the female Vv SDR. Selective sweep analysis of male, female, and 
544 
hermaphroditic individuals revealed one selective region from the comparison 
545 
of male and female accessions overlapped total the Amur grape putative SDR 
546 
including 16 genes all homologous to Vv SDR genes (such as APT3 gene, 
547 
PLATZ transcription factor gene and TPP gene). A previous study inferred that 
548 
VaAPT3 gene (orthologous to Vitis02G0508 in the present Va genome), located 
549 
in Amur grape putative SDR, was associated to sex determination (Men et al., 
550 
2021). Recently, the PLATZ transcription factor gene has been found to 
551 
determine the grape's sexuality (Iocco-Corena et al., 2021). The TPP gene also 
552 
located in Amur grape putative SDR and TPP genes in many species have also 
553 
been associated with sex determination, flower development, reproduction, and 
554 
synthesis of plant hormones, among other functions (Kataya et al., 2020; Qiu et

556 
developmental stages of Populus male and female floral buds (Gao et al., 2021). 
557 
Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) controls inflorescence architecture in 
558 
maize through sugar signal modification (Satoh-Nagasawa et al., 2006). This 
559 
suggests that the hypothetical Va SDR may be related to sex determination. One 
560 
selected region was from the comparison of male and hermaphroditic accessions 
561 
overlapped part of Amur grape putative SDR including only one gene 
562 
(PPR-containing gene), which is homologous to the Vv SDR gene 
563 
PPR-containing gene. Additionally, some selective regions may be related to 
564 
Va sex determining. Previous study indicated that some PPR-containing 
565 
proteins genes could restore fertility to cytoplasmic male-sterile plants 
566 
(Bentolila et al., 2002; Koizuka et al., 2003; Kazama et al., 2003; Hu et al., 
567 
2012). A study on RNA-Seq analysis of three flower sex types in grapevine 
568 
showed some grape PPR-containing genes could be essential for carpel 
569 
development (Ramos et al., 2014). The study also inferred that PPR-containing 
570 
gene may be essential for the perfect development of sexual floral organs. Here, 
571 
we found that some other selected regions comprises many PPR-containing 
572 
protein genes, allowing for further exploration of their likely contribution to 
573 
sex determination.  
574 
However, no selected region overlapped the Amur grape putative SDR 
575 
from the comparison of male and hermaphroditic accessions was found. We 
576 
found that the type and arrangement order of all genes in the putative SDR of 
577 
female Va and the SDR of Vitis vinifera were similar. However, compared with 
578 
Vv F haplotypes, the putative SDR of female Vitis amurensis has lost one FMO 
579 
gene and contains one extra Uncharacterized protein. The Uncharacterized 
580 
protein gene has never been found in SDR of Vv Cabernet Sauvignon and Vv. 
581 
sylvestris (Massonnet et al., 2020). The role of the Uncharacterized protein gene 
582 
in Vitis amurensissex determination needs further exploration.

In the other selective region (chr17:11450001bp-13785000bp)， we found 
584 
from the comparison of Va male and hermaphroditic accessions, there are many 
585 
MADS-box protein AGL62 genes. Previous study inferred MADS-box protein 
586 
genes may be also related to developing male and female flowers (Hardenack 
587 
et al., 1994; Ainsworth et al., 1995). We consider that the region  
588 
(chr17:11450001bp-13785000bp) may be also related to Va sex-determining. 
589 
Plus those selective regions that have been found to contain the PPR-containing 
590 
proteins genes, it should be explored whether Vitis amurensis sex may be 
591 
determined by several different genomic regions in the future.

Materials and methods 
594 
Plant materials and DNA sequencing 
595 
Fresh leaves and stems of Vitis amurensis cv. “Zuoshan No. 1” were sampled for 
596 
DNA extraction and sequencing. Total genomic DNA was extracted using the 
597 
CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium Ammonium Bromide)) method (Tel-Zur et al., 
598 
1999). The library for ONT sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technology, Oxford, 
599 
UK) was constructed using large (>15 kb) DNA fragments with the 
600 
SQK-LSK109 Ligation Sequencing Kit and sequenced using the ONT platform. 
601 
Adapters and low-quality nucleotides (with <7 mean quality score) were 
602 
trimmed off. Paired-end libraries with 350 bp insert sizes were constructed 
603 
following the manufacturer’s protocols and sequenced using the MGIseq 2000 
604 
platform (MGI Tech Co. LTD, Guangdong, China). The MGIseq reads were 
605 
filtered 
using 
the 
SOAPnuke1.5.6 
online 
software 
606 
(https://github.com/BGI-flexlab/SOAPnuke). 
For 
the 
high-throughput 
607 
chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) analysis, fresh leaves and stems of 
608 
Vitis amurensis cv. “Zuoshan No. 1” were treated following previous methods 
609 
(Yang et al., 2020).

Genome size and heterozygosity estimation  
612 
The genome size was estimated from the MGIseq reads using k-mer analysis, 
613 
and the k-mer depth-frequency distribution was generated using the jellyfish 
614 
software (Marçais and Kingsford, 2011). The genome size and heterozygosity 
615 
were calculated using the genomeScope software (Vurture et al., 2017).  
616 
 
617 
De novo genome assembly  
618 
Long 
ONT 
reads 
were 
corrected 
using 
Canu 
619 
(https://github.com/marbl/canu/releases), and de novo assembled using the 
620 
Smartdenovo software (https://github.com/ruanjue/smartdenovo). The Racon 
621 
(https://github.com/isovic/racon) 
and 
Medaka 
622 
(https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) software were applied to polish the 
623 
assembled contigs. The polished, assembled data were then corrected using 
624 
Pilon (v.1.22, https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon/). Next, the Haplomerger2 
625 
pipeline reduced the assembly to ~522 Mb. After that, the purged assembled 
626 
contigs were anchored into 19 pseudochromosomes using the Juicer with the 
627 
parameters “-g draft -s MboI” and 3D de novo assembly (3D-DNA) pipeline 
628 
with the parameters “-m haploid -r 2” (Durand et al., 2016; Dudchenko et al., 
629 
2017).  
630 
 
631 
Genome annotation and gene prediction 
632 
Transposable elements (TEs) were predicted using combined homology-based 
633 
comparisons with RepeatMaskerv4.0.7, RepeatProteinMask v4.0.7, and de novo 
634 
approaches with Piler (Edgar and Myers, 2005) (http://www.drive5.com/piler/), 
635 
RepeatScout, and RepeatModeler. Tandem repeats were identified using the 
636 
Tandem 
Repeats 
Finder 
v4.09 
(Benson., 
1999) 
637 
(http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.html) and LTR_FINDER v1.06 (Zhao and Hao,

gene set was deduced by de novo, homology, and evidence-based gene 
640 
prediction (transcriptome data) (Guo et al., 2021). The transcript evidence 
641 
included transcripts assembled from the RNA-Seq data of different tissues (leaf, 
642 
stem, flowers, tendril, and fruit; Table S9). Next, the predicted genes were 
643 
functionally annotated using a previous method (Guo et al., 2021). Moreover, 
644 
tRNA was identified using tRNAscan-SE 1.3.1 (Lowe and Eddy, 1997) 
645 
(http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/), BLASTN identifiedrRNA, while 
646 
INFERNAL (http://infernal.janelia.org/) identified miRNA and snRNA.  
647 
 
648 
Genome homology inference 
649 
Protein sequences from one plant were searched against themself and those 
650 
another plant genome using BLASTP (Camacho et al., 2009) to find the best, 
651 
secondarily best, and the other matches with E_value<1E-5. Dot plots were 
652 
produced using the WGDI package of Python (Sun et al., 2021). Colinear genes 
653 
were inferred using the -icl subprogram contained in WGDI package with 
654 
default parameters. Nucleotide substitution rates were estimated between 
655 
colinear homologous genes using the YN00 program in the PAML (v4.9h) 
656 
package implementing the Nei-Gojobori approach (Yang, 2007).   
657 
 
658 
Species tree 
659 
A rooted species tree was inferred using the Orthofinder (version 2.5.4) with the 
660 
“-M msa” parameter (Emms and Kelly, 2015; Emms and Kelly, 2019) based on 
661 
5929 single-copy genes.

Identification and characterization of cold-related genes 
664 
The cold-related genes in the three grape species and gene network robustness

Structural variations analysis 
668 
The SV analysis was performed using the NUCmer program embedded in 
669 
MUMmer with the parameters “-mumreference -g 1000 -c 90 -l 40”. (Yu et al., 
670 
2021). Genomic-specific segment analysis was performed as follows. First, the 
671 
query genome sequences was split into 500bp windows with a overlapping step 
672 
size of 100bp. and then all the 500bp windows subsequnces was aligned against 
673 
the references genome by BWA-mem with the parameters “-w 500 -M”. The 
674 
500bp window that failed to align or aligned with less than 25% coverage were 
675 
defined as the 
genomic-specific segments. 
The genes 
within the 
676 
genomic-specific segments, were defined as the specific-genes of the query 
677 
genome (species-specific PAV genes). Structural variation plots was drawn 
678 
using ggplot2. 
679 
 
680 
Widely targeted metabolomic analysis 
681 
Berries from four growth stages were used for this study, including Stage1 (S1, 
682 
the late period of berry expansion), Stage 2 (S2, Veraison), Stage 3 (S3, the 
683 
period when berries change color completely), and Stage 4 (S4, maturity stage). 
684 
Three biological replicates from each stage were used for metabolome analysis. 
685 
The Metware Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China) performed the 
686 
metabolome extraction and analysis using previous methods (Ma et al., 2021). 
687 
The metabolites were identified using the Metware database (MWDB), and 
688 
metabolite abundances were determined according to the metabolite peak areas. 
689 
Metabolites were considered as differentially accumulated when the variable 
690 
importance in projection (VIP) was ≥1, and the absolute log2 (fold change) was 
691 
≥1. Metabolic pathways were constructed according to the KEGG database.

Berries from four growth stages (S1, S2, S3 and S4) were grind into 
695 
homogenate used for this study. Three biological replicates from each stage 
696 
were used for metabolome analysis. We analyzed the total sugar content using 
697 
sulfuric acid-anthrone colorimetric method and the instrument used is Lanbda 
698 
365 ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometer. We analyzed the titratable acidity 
699 
content using acid-base titration and the standard solution is Sodium hydroxide 
700 
standard solution (0.05 mol/L). 
701 
 
702 
RNA-seq 
703 
Just as we analyzed the metabolome, berries from four stages, S1, S2, S3, and 
704 
S4, were used for the RNA-seq analysis. Three biological replicates from each 
705 
berry stage were used for RNA-seq analysis. Novogene Co. LTD performed the 
706 
RNA-seq experiments on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform (Illumina, CA, 
707 
USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions and previously described steps 
708 
(Zhang et al., 2021). All paired-end reads were mapped to the Va genome using 
709 
Hisat2 v2.0.5. Expression levels were calculated using the fragments per 
710 
kilobase of exon model per million mapped fragments (FPKM). The DEGSeq R 
711 
package (1.20.0) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). 
712 
Genes with adjusted P value < 0.05 and fold changes ≥ 2 or ≤ -2 were identified 
713 
as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). 
714 
 
715 
Integrated analysis of metabolome and RNA-seq 
716 
For the combined analysis of all metabolome and transcriptome, the canonical 
717 
correlation analysis (CCA) was performed on the metabolome and RNA-seq 
718 
data using CCA package in the R statistical environment (Gonzalez et al., 
719 
2008). Next, the WGCNA (Weighted correlation network analysis) was 
720 
performed on all RNA-seq and metabolome data using the WGCNA package in 
721 
the R statistical environment.

Population genetic analysis 
724 
Essentially, 24 Amur grape genotypes were re-sequenced based on the Va 
725 
genome assembled in this studyand used for calling SNPs. Concurrently, the 
726 
ANNOVAR package was employed for population genetic analysis. Ten folds 
727 
Va genome size of clean reads data of 24 kind of Amur grapewere separately 
728 
obtained on the MGI2000 platform. The SNPs in LD were filtered using PLINK 
729 
with a window size of 50 SNPs (advancing 5 SNPs at a time) and a 0.5 r2 
730 
threshold. The PCA was conducted using GCTA (v1.25.2) (Yang et al., 2011). 
731 
Furthermore, the population structure was analyzed using FRAPPE, and the 
732 
MLtree was constructed using SNPhylo (Lee et al., 2014) to clarify the 
733 
phylogenetic relationships. 
734 
 
735 
Selective sweep analysis 
736 
Selective sweep analysis was performed using a previous method (Lin et al., 
737 
2022). In briefly, Fst and θπ were used to detect candidate selective regions 
738 
between the three grape populations, Fst and θπ were calculated using 
739 
PopGenome (Brigida et al., 2016; Pfeiferet et al., 2014); regions with both θπ 
740 
ratios and FST estimates in the top of 5% were considered as the selection 
741 
regions.
