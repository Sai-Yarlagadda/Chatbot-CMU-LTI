Introduction: Potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) is a particular concern 
in older patients and is associated with negative health outcomes. As various 
interventions have been developed to manage it, we  performed a systematic 
review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of pharmaceutical interventions 
on outcomes of PIMs in older patients.
Methods: Meta-analysis of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was 
conducted to report the outcomes of pharmaceutical interventions in older 
patients searching from the databases of Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, 
Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov, SinoMed and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry 
(ChiCTR). The PRISMA guidelines were followed and the protocol was registered 
in PROSPERO (CRD42019134754). Cochrane bias risk assessment tool and the 
modified Jadad scale were used to assess the risk bias. RevMan software was used 
for data processing, analysis and graphical plotting.
Results: Sixty-five thousand, nine hundred seventy-one patients in 14 RCTs 
were included. Of the primary outcomes, pharmaceutical interventions could 
significantly reduce the incidence of PIMs in older patients (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 
0.42, 0.62; p < 0.001), and the number of PIMs per person (MD = -0.41, 95%CI: 
−0.51, −0.31; p < 0.001), accompanying by a low heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis 
showed that the application of computer-based clinical decision support for 
pharmacological interventions could remarkably decrease the incidence of PIMs 
and two assessment tools were more effective. Of the secondary outcomes, 
the meta-analysis showed that pharmacological interventions could reduce the 
number of drugs used per person (MD = -0.94, 95%CI: −1.51, −0.36; p = 0.001) and 
30-day readmission rate (OR = 0.58, 95%CI: 0.36, 0.92; p = 0.02), accompanying by 
a low heterogeneity. However, the pharmaceutical interventions demonstrated 
no significant improvement on all-cause mortality and the number of falls.
Conclusion: Our findings supported the efficacy of pharmaceutical interventions 
to optimize the use and management of drugs in older patients.

inappropriate medications, meta-analysis
Introduction
The social and economic implications of older population are 
becoming increasingly apparent worldwide. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) has estimated that more than one in five 
individuals will be aged over 60 years by 2050, accounting for a total 
of 2 billion people in the world (1). Due to the prevalence of diverse 
diseases among older people, medications are commonly used to 
control the progression of diseases (2). In addition, the majority of 
older patients are treated by different therapeutic strategies. Therefore, 
concurrent treatment with polypharmacy is common among older 
people (3).
With the degradation of organs and physiological functions in 
older people, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the 
system could also change, thus, the risks of adverse drug reaction 
(ADR) and adverse drug event (ADE) could be elevated (4, 5), as well 
as increasing the rate of mortality (6) and the incidence of potentially 
inappropriate medications (PIMs). PIMs comprise a number of 
suboptimal prescribing practices, including inappropriate dose or 
duration of medication, drug–drug interaction, and drug-disease 
interaction (4). PIMs in older people are highly prevalent across a 
variety of healthcare settings, and are associated with the increased 
risk of ADEs, morbidity, mortality, health expenditure, healthcare 
utilization and frequent falling (7–10). It was estimated that 20–30% 
of all hospital admissions were related to prescription of drugs (11, 
12), and up to 10% of all ADEs could be life-threatening or fatal (13).
Pharmaceutical intervention is the combination of modern 
pharmacology and clinical medicine, aiming to optimize the 
individualized drug therapy, improve the therapeutic effects of drugs, 
reduce the risk of the drug therapy, and ensure the safety and cost-
effectiveness of the drug therapy (14). Pharmaceutical interventions 
could be performed specifically according to the epidemiology of 
PIMs and strategies, including specific health education and targeted 
interventions, which could substantially reduce the incidence of PIMs 
in older people (15).
However, current evidences vary substantially, and there are still 
debates on the influences of pharmaceutical interventions on 
outcomes of PIMs in older patients. Previous Cochrane systematic 
reviews (15, 16) could not draw robust conclusions from the evidences 
due to variability in design, interventions, outcomes and results. The 
most recent systematic review (17), which included all types of studies, 
suggests that PIM-setting-directed interventions should be developed 
to promote the wellbeing of the older patients through PIM reduction. 
However, it only reviewed and compared different interventions and 
outcomes, and did not conduct a meta-analysis. Therefore, 
we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis base on high-
quality RCTs to evaluate and provide more reliable evidence of 
pharmaceutical interventions on PIMs in older patients.
Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and 
reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement (18). It 
has been registered in the International Prospective Register of 
Systematic Reviews (CRD42019134754).
Search strategy
The systematic search was undertaken in February 17, 2021, using 
the defined PICOS statement (population, intervention, comparison, 
outcomes, study type) to identify all relevant articles: Cochrane 
Library, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov, SinoMed 
and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) databases. Population 
was defined as older patients, which included the patients older than 
65 years old or the studies clearly defined older patients. For the 
intervention, we focused on the pharmaceutical interventions on 
potentially inappropriate medications, including all kinds of strategies 
and tools/criterions. For outcome, we included studies reporting the 
rationally of medication use (incidence of PIMs, the number of drugs 
used and so on) and the prognosis of patients (mortality，falls and so 
on). RCT followed our PICOs framework was included. The terms 
used in the searching process included “aged” and “inappropriate 
medications” for English databases, and the corresponding Chinese 
terms were used in the Chinese databases. The references of the 
included studies were also reviewed to reduce the rate of missing data. 
The Appendix Table 1 listed as example of full search strings applicable 
to PubMed.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) RCTs; (2) subjects who 
aged ≥65 years old; (3) involvement of pharmaceutical intervention in 
the study group, and routine diagnosis and treatment in the control 
group; (4) outcome included the occurrence of PIMs.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) unclear study design; (2) 
unclear interventions; (3) unclear outcomes; (4) duplicate publication; 
(5) unpublished studies; and (6) full-text could not be retrieved.
Compared with the protocol registered (CRD42019134754) in 
PROSPERO, since few studies reported the number of drugs used, it 
is difficult to determine polypharmacy, and the non-hospitalized 
patients such as outpatient and emergency department could not 
be ignored, the included population was expanded to all older patients 
over 65 years old. At the same time, intervention was usually not 
performed and completed by pharmacists independently, and it is 
impossible to evaluate the effect of pharmacist interventions alone, so 
it is expanded to all pharmaceutical interventions.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Data were extracted using the predefined data extraction form by 
two investigators independently and cross-check was also performed. 
The disagreements were resolved by making discussion between the 
two investigators or involved the third investigator. The extracted data

included: (1) general characteristics and data of the included studies, 
involving the first authors’ full-name, year of publication, country, 
study type, subjects’ age, and sample size; (2) indicators of study 
quality, such as the methods of randomization, allocation concealment, 
blinding, drop out, and loss to follow-up; (3) detailed measurement of 
intervention; and (4) indicators of clinical outcomes (PIMs-related 
clinical and economic outcomes, as well as humanistic outcomes, for 
example, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction, medication 
adherence and so on).
Cochrane bias risk assessment tool (19) and the modified Jadad 
scale (20) were utilized for the assessment of the included studies. The 
Cochrane bias risk assessment tool covered the following 7 aspects: 
(1) randomization; (2) allocation concealment; (3) blinding to subjects 
and investigators; (4) blinding to evaluators; (5) completeness of 
outcome data; (6) selective report of data; and (7) other sources of 
bias. The modified Jadad scale evaluated the quality of the included 
studies from 4 aspects, such as randomization, allocation concealment, 
blinding, and drop out, and the assessment results were classified as 
“appropriate,” “unclear,” and “inappropriate,” with the corresponding 
scores of 2, 1, and 0, respectively. Studies with the total score of 4–7 
points were considered as high-quality, and studies with the total score 
of 1–3 points were considered as low-quality.
Statistical analysis
Review Manager 5.4 software was used for data processing. 
Heterogeneity was assessed by the I2 index and Q test (21). I2 ≤ 50% 
indicate low heterogeneity, and the fixed-effects model was used to 
pool the results. Otherwise, I2>50% represent substantial or 
considerable heterogeneity, and the random-effects model was 
utilized (22). For the pooled analysis of binary variables, odds ratio 
(OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were 
estimated. For the pooled analysis of continuous variables, mean 
difference (MD) and 95% CI were estimated. For outcome indicators 
that could not be  analyzed by the meta-analysis, the descriptive 
analysis was applied.
Results
Search strategy
Totally, 48,345 studies were retrieved by the initial screening. After 
further screening according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 14 
RCTs were finally included in review 8 RCTs included in meta-
analysis. The study flowchart is shown in Figure 1.
General characteristics of the included 
studies
The detailed general characteristics of 14 RCTs are presented in 
Table 1.
The included studies were, respectively, performed in 7 countries, 
including 1 in Ireland (23), 1 in Spain (24), 1 in Israel (25), 2 in 
Belgium (26, 27), 3 in Canada (28–30), 3 in the United States (31–33), 
and 3 in Sweden (34–36).
6 of the 14 RCTs included the old patients from nursing home (24, 
25, 29, 34) or community-dwelling (28, 30, 34), which is the main 
facility for long-term medication treatment of older patients. The 
subjects were veterans in 1 study (31), cancer patients in 1 study (32), 
and patients with dementia or cognitive dysfunctions in 1 study (36). 
Finally, 65,971 subjects, including 32,941 in the study group and 
33,030  in the control group, were involved in the present 
meta-analysis.
Pharmaceutical intervention strategies are diverse and distinctive, 
with assessment and management of medication being the most 
common intervention.12 (23, 25–27, 29–40) of the 14 studies 
implemented similar interventions, for example, a team to provide 
strict surveillance and feedback for all medications. Interventions in 
8 studies (23, 25, 30, 32–36) was to optimize medication use through 
clinical pharmacist-physician discussion in meetings, face-to-face, 
telephone call, e-mail communication. Regarding interventions for 
patients, medication education is provided through paper materials 
or online videos (28, 35) and face-to-face communication (32).
The tools for assessing PIM, included Beers’ criteria, screening 
tool of older person’s potentially inappropriate prescription (STOPP)/
screening tool to alert doctors to the right treatment (START) criteria, 
and PIM list designed by the pharmaceutical council. In addition, 12 
studies (23–25, 27, 28, 30–36) used one assessment tool, 2 studies (26, 
29) utilized 2 assessment tools, 5 studies (26, 28, 29, 31, 32) employed 
the Beers’ criteria, 5 studies (24–26, 29, 35) used the STOPP/START 
criteria, and 6 studies (23, 27, 30, 33, 34, 36) utilized the PIM list 
designed by the pharmaceutical council.
From the 14 RCTs included in the study, a total of 13 outcomes 
were reported (the outcome column of Table 1), of which PIMs was 
the most widely evaluated and considered as the primary outcomes. 
All the 14 studies (23–36) evaluated PIMs, 4 studies (23, 28, 29, 34) 
reported all-cause mortality, 3 studies (24, 29, 36) reported all-cause 
emergent admission rate, 3 studies (24, 25, 30) reported the number 
of drugs used, 2 studies (24, 29) reported length of stay in hospital, 2 
studies (29, 36) reported readmissions rate within 30 days of hospital 
discharge, 2 studies (24, 25) reported the number of falling events, 1 
study (31) reported incidence of ADR, 1 study (25) reported cost of 
drugs, 1 study (24) reported the number of delirium episodes events 
and the number of visits to physician or nurse. Besides, 4 studies (26, 
28, 29, 33) utilized the computer-based clinical decision support 
(CCDS) for intervention.
Quality assessment
Quality assessment was performed for the methodology of 
included studies Appendix Figure  1 shows the results of quality 
assessment by Cochrane bias risk assessment tool, in which “+” 
indicates meeting the requirements, “-” represents no satisfaction of 
the requirements, and “?” denotes an unclear status. There were 2 
studies (31, 34), in which all the items met the requirements. 
Appendix Figure 2 illustrates the percentage of each item for quality 
assessment of the included studies. All the 14 included studies (23–36) 
used randomization, without selective reporting of data. Allocation 
concealment was applied in 10 studies (23, 24, 28–32, 34–36), double-
blinding in 6 studies (24, 31, 33–36), blinding to evaluators in 9 studies 
(23, 24, 28, 30, 31, 33–36), complete data in 2 studies (31, 34), and 
other sources of bias in 3 studies (23, 25, 36).

Base on the modified Jadad scale, 10 studies (23, 24, 28, 29, 31–36) 
had the quality score of 4–7 points, indicating that the risk of bias was 
low and the quality of studies was high. Moreover, 4 studies (25–27, 
30) were found with the quality score of 1–3 points, demonstrating 
that the quality of studies was relatively low (Appendix Table 2).
Primary outcomes
Incidence of PIMs
PIMs were reported in 14 studies, in which 6 studies (24–26, 29, 
30, 36) that enrolled 1933 subjects (989 in the study group and 944 in 
the control group) reported the incidence of PIMs. The heterogeneity 
test showed a low heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 0%, p = 0.50), and 
thus, the fixed-effects model was used for the pooled analysis. The 
findings revealed that pharmaceutical intervention could significantly 
reduce the incidence of PIMs (OR = 0.51, 95%CI: 0.42, 0.62; p < 0.001; 
Figure 2A). Subgroup analysis was performed based on the application 
of CCDS, selection of assessment tools, and interventional strategies.
Of the 6 studies that reported the incidence of PIMs, 2 studies 
(26, 29) used the CCDS. The CCDS could automatically acquire the 
basic characteristics of patients, such as age, gender, body weight, 
comorbidities, medications, and examination results. In addition, the 
CCDS could send alerts when the medication changes, assisting the 
mediation assessment and pharmaceutical interventions. The 
comparison of the incidence of PIMs between the study group and 
control group that employed the CCDS showed that the difference 
was statistically significant (OR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.29, 0.57; p < 0.001). 
The comparison of the incidence of PIMs between these two groups 
that did not employ the CCDS indicated that the difference was also 
statistically significant (OR = 0.57, 95%CI: 0.45, 0.73; p < 0.001). 
Although both subgroup comparisons achieved statistical 
significance, the pooled intervention effects of trials employing 
CCDS were superior to those without employing CCDS in terms of 
the magnitude of effect size (Appendix Figure 2A).
Of the 6 studies that reported the incidence of PIMs, 2 studies (26, 
29) used the Beers’ criteria, 4 studies (24–26, 29) utilized the STOPP/
START criteria, and the other studies employed the PIM list designed

by the pharmaceutical council. Besides, 2 studies (26, 29) of the 6 
studies used two assessment tools.
The comparison of the incidence of PIMs between the two groups 
that used one assessment tool revealed that the difference was 
statistically significant (OR = 0.57, 95%CI: 0.45, 0.73; p < 0.001). The 
comparison of the incidence of PIMs between the two groups that 
used two assessment tools showed that the difference was also 
statistically significant (OR = 0.41, 95%CI: 0.29, 0.57; p < 0.001). 
Although both subgroup comparisons achieved statistical significance, 
the pooled intervention effects of trials using two assessment tools 
were superior to those using single assessment tool in terms of the 
magnitude of effect size (Appendix Figure 2B).
Potentially inappropriate medications per person
Of the 14 studies that reported the incidence of PIMs, 2 studies (24, 
35) reported PIMs per person, which totally included 752 subjects (393 in 
the study group and 359 in the control group). The heterogeneity test 
showed a low heterogeneity among the included studies (I2 = 0%, p = 0.60), 
and thus, the fixed-effects model was used for the pooled analysis. The 
findings demonstrated that pharmaceutical intervention could 
significantly reduce the incidence of PIMs per person in older people 
(MD = -0.41, 95%CI: −0.51, −0.31; p < 0.001; Figure 2B).
Secondary outcomes
The number of drugs used per person
Among 3 studies that reported the number of drugs used, 2 
studies (24, 25) that enrolled 637 patients (311 in the study group and 
326 in the control group) reported the number of drugs used per 
person. The heterogeneity test showed a low heterogeneity among the 
included studies (I2 = 0%, p = 0.79), and the fixed-effects model was 
used for the pooled analysis. The results showed that pharmaceutical 
intervention could significantly reduce the number of drugs used per 
person in older people (MD = -0.94, 95%CI: −1.51, −0.36, p = 0.001; 
Figure 3A).
30-day readmission rate
In 2 studies (29, 36) that reported the 30-day readmission 
rate, 683 subjects were enrolled, including 338 in the study group 
and 345 in the control group. Heterogeneity test showed a low 
heterogeneity among the eligible studies (I2 = 0%, p = 0.48), and 
the fixed-effects model was used for the pooled analysis. The 
findings revealed that the pharmaceutical intervention could 
significantly reduce the 30-day readmission rate (OR = 0.58, 
95%CI: 0.36, 0.92; p = 0.02; Figure 3B).
All-cause mortality
There were 4 studies (23, 28, 29, 34) that reported the all-cause 
mortality and enrolled 1,446 subjects, of whom 729 and 717 subjects 
were in the study group and control group, respectively. Heterogeneity 
test showed a low heterogeneity among the included studies (I2 = 0%, 
p = 0.58), and the fixed-effects model was used for the pooled analysis. 
The results revealed that the effects of pharmaceutical intervention on 
the all-cause mortality were not significantly different between the two 
groups (OR = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.64, 1.37; p = 0.73; Figure 3C).
Falls
In 2 studies (24, 25) that reported the average number of falls, 968 
subjects were enrolled, including 470 and 498 subjects in the study 
group and control group, respectively. Heterogeneity test showed a 
moderate heterogeneity among the eligible studies (I2 = 55%, p = 0.14), 
and the random-effects model was used for the pooled analysis. The 
findings showed that the effects of pharmaceutical intervention on the 
average number of falls were not significantly different between the 
two groups (MD = -0.23, 95%CI: −0.57, 0.12; p = 0.21; Figure 3D).
Discussion
The present study systematically reviewed 14 RCTs to compare the 
effects of pharmaceutical interventions on older people. The results 
indicated that the incidence of PIMs, the number of PIMs per person,

the number of drugs used, and 30-day readmission rate were 
significantly lower in the pharmaceutical intervention group, and the 
subgroup analysis showed that the application of the CCDS and 
assessment tools, such as Beers’ and STOPP criteria, could markedly 
reduce the incidence of PIMs. It is noteworthy that the current study 
further comprehensively evaluated the effect of pharmaceutical 
intervention on potentially inappropriate medications in older 
patients by including high-quality RCTs and integrating intervention 
effects through meta-analysis.
PIMs are associated with risks that are greater than their potential 
benefits, and older patients are at a greater risk of ADEs from PIMs. 
Reducing the incidence of PIMs will be  significant to reduce the 
incidence of ADEs and improve the prognosis of older patients. There 
are a variety of intervention strategies and methods that can effectively 
reduce the incidence of the PIMs. Subgroup analysis showed that the 
application of CCDS could reduce the incidence of the PIMs, which is 
consistent with the result of a previous study (37). The advantage of 
CDSS is not only associated with the efficient and accurate identification 
and reduction of PIMs, but also with the ability to change the prescribing 
behavior of physicians (38). In the present study, further subgroup 
analysis suggested that using single assessment tool may not 
be comprehensive in assessing PIMs, and the multiple assessment tools 
achieved a more desirable intervention result. This finding is consistent 
with the conclusion of Kurczewska-Michalak et al. (41) that no “gold 
standard” is identifiable and advisable, and the complexity, applicability 
and usability of tools needs to be considered. The complementarity of the 
different tools was also confirmed by Lisowska et al. (42), the PILA tool 
that included STOPP/START v.2 and Amsterdam tool identified the 
highest number of PIMs and achieved the most comprehensive 
assessment of pharmacotherapy appropriateness in geriatric patients. 
Overall, CDSS combining different prescription indicators should 
be considered as an important tool to optimize drug prescription for 
older patients.
Pharmaceutical interventions could significantly reduce the number 
of drugs used per person and 30-day readmission rate. Deprescribing is 
the process of systematically reviewing a patient’s medications and 
discontinuing drugs in instances, in which existing or potential harms 
outweigh existing or potential benefits within the context of an individual 
patient’s care goals, current level of functioning, life expectancy, values, 
and preferences (39, 40). A growing body of evidence related to the 
adverse effects of polypharmacy on older patients supported the need for 
deprescribing (43), and the number of drugs that a patient is taking is the 
most important predictor of ADEs (44). Therefore, the number of drugs 
used per person and 30-day readmission rate reflect the efficacy and safety

of drug therapy, as well as being important indicators for testing the effects 
of pharmaceutical interventions. Additionally, regarding the economic 
endpoint, although only one study (25) reported the cost of drugs, 
pharmaceutical interventions could effectively reduce the cost of drugs in 
the study group compared with that in the control group. Economic 
systematic reviews (45) focusing on polypharmacy have expressed the 
same view, with interventions generally associated with a reduction in 
medication expenditure. Available evidence suggests that the potential 
benefits of interventions to optimize medication use outweigh the costs 
of their implementation, and the results of the included cost–benefit 
analysis studies (46–48) showed a net benefit that was null or positive.
The all-cause mortality and average number of falls were both lower 
in the study group than those in the control group, however, the 
differences were not statistically significant. The mortality rates were 
consistent with those reported previously (15). This can be related to 
contribution of other factors affecting mortality, of which disease 
progression is noteworthy. However, there are still some drug-related 
factors that require clinicians’ attention (49–51). Several studies (52, 53) 
have shown that targeted pharmacological interventions for fall risk, 
including withdrawal of potential fall-risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs), 
pharmacist-conducted clinical medication review, and computerized 
drug alerts, were effective in reducing fall risk. However, tools for 
assessing PIM, such as Beers’ and STOPP criteria, do not concentrate 
on FRIDs. Therefore, in the comprehensive pharmacological 
intervention, the management of FRIDs still needs to be improved, and 
it is suggested to reduce the fall risk in older patients with polypharmacy.
Because no “gold standard” has been identified, multiple interventions 
toward PIMs are advised, so the diversity of interventions included and 
analyzes in our meta-analysis is critical. Compared with the a scoping 
review of available interventions published in 2012 (41), relevant 
interventions, including prescription deprescribing, CDSS, medication 
therapy management (MTM) and so on, were all included in this meta-
analysis. Regarding the setting and supporter of pharmaceutical 
interventions, the most common setting is primary healthcare team. 
Additionally, some interventions were provided at community or hospital 
pharmacies, in the form of pharmacists alone or in cooperation with a 
physician or nurse. In summary, the following steps involved pharmacists 
are the key to appropriate medications in older patients: patients’ 
evaluation and data collection, medication review, being agree with 
patients on treatment objectives, prescription decision, communication 
and obtaining patient agreement, medication dispensing, medication 
usage, monitoring and assessment (41, 54).
Totally, 14 eligible RCTs were involved in the present study, which 
were mainly accompanied by a relatively high-quality. However, the 
limitations of this study were summarized as follows: (1) outcomes in the 
included studies varied, and only relatively few studies reported the same 
outcomes; (2) the data of the included studies were reported inconsistently, 
and thus, some outcomes could not be pooled; (3) only one study reported 
the cost of drugs; (4) difference in ethnicity, language, educational level, 
places for interventions and follow-up time among the subjects and 
studies all might influence the outcomes. (5) the possibility of missing 
studies not included in the databases we used and the articles published 
in other langue not being included in our analysis, (6) the risk of bias 
cannot be excluded, although most heterogeneity is acceptable. Therefore, 
more rigorously designed multi-center RCTs with larger sample size and 
longer follow-up with high-quality are needed to further validate the 
findings of the present study.
Conclusion
In summary, pharmaceutical interventions may improve the 
prognosis of older patients via reducing the incidence of PIMs, the 
number of PIMs per person, the number of drugs used, and 30-day 
readmission rate. Our findings supported the efficacy of pharmaceutical 
interventions to optimize the use and management of drugs for 
older patients.
