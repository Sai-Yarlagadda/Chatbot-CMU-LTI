Background: Physical exercise has been recommended as an important 
nonpharmacological therapeutic strategy for managing attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD). We  conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to assess the 
comparative impact of different physical exercise modalities on enhancing executive 
functions (EFs) and alleviating symptoms in children and adolescents with ADHD.
Methods: We searched Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, CNKI, and clinical trials 
databases from inception to October 20, 2022. Randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies investigating physical exercise for ADHD-
related symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention, and executive 
functions were included. The frequentist random-effect NMA method was 
applied to pool the results.
Results: A total of 59 studies (including 39 RCTs, 5 quasi-RCTs, and 15 self-
controlled trials) published between 1983 and 2022 were incorporated into 
the systematic review, of which 44 studies with 1757 participants were eligible 
for meta-analysis. All types of physical exercise were effective in improving 
EFs (SMD = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.46), and open-skill activities which require 
participants to react in a dynamically changing and externally paced environment 
induced the most incredible benefits for executive functions (SUCRA = 98.0%, 
SMD = 1.96, and 95% CI: 1.15 to 2.77). Subgroup analyses for EFs revealed varied 
findings that open-skill activities were the most promising physical exercise type 
for improving inhibitory control (SUCRA = 99.1%, SMD = 1.94, and 95% CI: 1.24 to 
2.64), and closed-skill activities dominated by aerobic exercises had a slightly 
higher probability of being the most promising physical exercise intervention 
for working memory (SUCRA = 75.9%, SMD = 1.21, and 95% CI: −0.22 to 2.65), and 
multicomponent physical exercise tended to be the most effective in cognitive 
flexibility (SUCRA = 70.3%, SMD = 1.44, and 95% CI: −0.19 to 3.07). Regarding ADHD-
related symptoms, closed-skill activities dominated by aerobic exercises might 
be more advantageous for hyperactivity/impulsivity (SUCRA = 72.5%, SMD = -1.60,

Conclusion: Physical exercise can significantly help to alleviate the symptoms of 
ADHD and improve executive functions in children and adolescents with ADHD. 
Most of all, to promote adherence to treatment, they should be encouraged to 
perform the physical exercises that they enjoy most.

1. Introduction
With a global prevalence of 5.29 to 7.2%, attention-deficit/
hyperactivity 
disorder 
(ADHD) 
is 
the 
most 
common 
neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder in childhood and generally 
persists into adulthood (1). ADHD is generally characterized by 
developmentally inappropriate levels of “core symptoms,” including 
inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity (2), which affect children’s 
behavior, emotion, and executive functions (EFs) and may lead to 
multidimensional difficulties in their academic and social abilities (3–6).
The symptoms of ADHD can be categorized into two types of 
behavioral problems (2). Inattention is a prominent symptom of 
ADHD and a necessary symptom for diagnosis. Children with 
ADHD are characterized by abnormalities in concentration, stability, 
and selectivity of attention, lacking resistance to extraneous stimuli. 
Hyperactivity/impulsivity is another major symptom of ADHD, 
manifested by a significantly higher level of activity than typically 
developing children, which is more pronounced in situations 
requiring sitting down or the need for order.
Executive function deficits are a hallmark characteristic of 
individuals with ADHD. Executive functions refer to advanced cognitive 
skills that assist with planning, organizing, problem solving and 
managing, and they contain three core components: inhibitory control, 
working memory, and cognitive flexibility (7, 8). According to Barkley’s 
response inhibition model theory, impairment of inhibitory function is 
the primary cause of ADHD symptoms and secondary impairment of 
executive function (9). Numerous studies have reported that children 
and adolescents with ADHD have lower reaction speeds and correctness 
scores than control subjects with typical development (10, 11) and have 
verified that children with ADHD struggle greatly with EFs, including 
managing impulsive behavior, cognition, and attention; they routinely 
make careless mistakes while doing schoolwork and have difficulty 
paying attention when performing tasks or playing (12).
Currently, medications and behavioral and psychological therapy 
are the mainstays of ADHD treatment (13, 14). Researchers have found 
that more than one-third of children do not respond, respond only 
partially, or encounter adverse drug reactions to these medications (15), 
and it may be challenging to adhere to these drug regimens owing to 
their time-consuming nature and high financial cost (16). In recent 
years, physical exercise interventions for children and adolescents with 
ADHD have gained increased attention from researchers. Several 
studies have concluded that 6 weeks of football exercise helped to 
improve the EFs of boys with ADHD (17), and an 8-week swimming 
program enhanced mental health and cognitive and motor coordination 
parameters in children with ADHD (18). There were also meta-analysis 
studies showing that exercise significantly affected children and 
adolescents with ADHD (16, 19); physical exercise helps them to engage 
in meaningful sensorimotor interactions with their surroundings and 
develop the ability to structure their brain activity patterns, which are 
crucial for executive functions (20). Physical exercise also has the 
potential to act as an endogenous stimulus to set off a series of 
neuroplastic molecular processes that eventually result in structural 
adaptations and changes in the network activity of the brain, thereby 
enhancing neurotransmitter systems and upregulating brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurogenesis (20). Additionally, by 
boosting dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitters, physical 
exercise may act physiologically similarly to stimulant drugs for 
alleviating the symptoms of ADHD. In combining the above results, 
physical exercise has been recommended as an important 
nonpharmacological therapeutic strategy for managing ADHD.
Traditional meta-analysis approaches fail to answer important 
questions about which form of intervention works the best, and no 
previous systematic studies have reported which physical exercise is 
optimal for enhancing executive functions and alleviating symptoms 
in children and adolescents with ADHD. This is a complicated 
question that deserves more research and has important implications 
for public health and education. Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a 
novel analytic approach combining direct and indirect evidence that 
allows a comparison of the effects of more than two interventions 
simultaneously in a single analysis. Importantly, it enables alternative 
interventions to be ranked for a single outcome and displays the 
probability of each intervention’s relative efficacy, which can be helpful 
in guiding therapeutic decision-making (21, 22). We performed a 
systematic review and network meta-analysis that compared the 
relative efficacy of different modalities of physical exercise based on 
direct and indirect evidence and aimed to identify the optimal physical 
exercise intervention for improving executive functions and alleviating 
major symptoms in children and adolescents with ADHD.
2. Methods
2.1. Protocol
This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for 
Network Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-NMA) (23), and the PRISMA 
checklist is provided in Appendix 1. We registered our study in the 
Zhu et al. 
10.3389/fpubh.2023.1133727
Frontiers in Public Health
03
frontiersin.org
PROSPERO platform under registration number CRD 42022365188, 
and we followed the protocol for all the steps of this systematic review 
and network meta-analysis.
2.2. Search strategy
The search strategy was developed, piloted, and refined according 
to the Patient population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome 
(PICO) approach and previously published systematic reviews (16, 19, 
24). We performed the literature search in several English-language 
databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO and 
clinical trials.1 The authors also searched the Chinese-language 
database (CNKI) using the same terms in Chinese following the 
updated study protocol. The updated study protocol and protocol 
deviations are given in Appendix 2 S1 Table S1. We limited publication 
dates from inception to October 20, 2022, and no language restrictions 
were applied. We also hand-searched reference lists of included studies 
and related systematic reviews to ensure complete capture. The details 
of the search strategy are presented in Appendix 2 S2.
2.3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The criteria for inclusion were as follows: (a) participants aged 
<18 years (children or adolescents) with a diagnosis of ADHD of any 
subtype; (b) interventions involving the physical exercise program with 
no limitation on the frequency, intensity, time, and types; (c) the 
comparators were controlled (e.g., waiting list, no intervention, 
watching video, and sedentary attention control); (d) the outcomes were 
ADHD-related symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention, 
and executive functions as measured using several scales and tests; (e) 
RCTs, quasi-RCTs (participants were allocated to groups using 
nonrandom methods, e.g., consecutive appearance, day of the week), 
and self-controlled trials were eligible. (f) The studies were included 
regardless of medication status. If medicine was used as a comparative 
intervention in the control group, the study will be solely used as a 
qualitative review rather than a quantitative meta-analysis. Studies were 
excluded if they met the following criteria: (a) interventions that did not 
involve physical exercise or (b) noninterventional clinical trials, such as 
protocols, review studies, cohort studies, case–control studies, 
conference papers, and book chapters.
2.4. Study selection and data extraction
The titles and abstracts of the studies found by using the search 
strategy were independently reviewed by two authors. The final decision 
was then made after reading the full texts of the remaining studies. The 
interrater agreement for the authors’ abstract and full text screening was 
calculated as the Kappa score by IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 (SPSS, 
Chicago, IL, United States), which was judged as excellent (≥0.75), good 
(0.60–0.74), fair (0.40–0.59), and poor (<0.40).

We did not restrict the studies by language and translation where 
feasible, and we manually omitted studies featuring obvious errors. 
Two authors separately extracted the data, and any discrepancies were 
discussed among the authors to come to a conclusion. If a disagreement 
persisted, the outcome was decided by a third author. The study 
characteristics (first author’s name, publication year, country, and study 
design), participant characteristics (sample size, age, and sex ratio), 
intervention characteristics (type, frequency, intensity, duration per 
session, and length of intervention), comparator information, and 
outcomes (the pertinent statistics at the intervention’s endpoint for 
estimating effect sizes) were all presented in the data extraction table. 
The mean in each group was multiplied by −1 when the studies were 
reverse-scaled (greater values indicated lower outcomes rather than 
better results). Where standard deviations (SDs) were not provided, 
they were derived from standard errors (SEs), confidence intervals 
(CIs), or t or p values, or attempts were made to contact the authors at 
least three times through e-mails to collect the missing data. GetData 
Digitizer version 2.20 software was used to extract the data we required 
from graphs when the authors did not provide the data in the study but 
instead provided a graph containing the data.
2.5. Data coding and management
The physical exercise interventions were classified according to 
following four hierarchical levels, which was more suitable for children 
and adolescents and agreed with the research steering committee. 
First, the interventions were coded as “Physical exercise” or “Control.” 
At the second level, the interventions were coded based on their main 
characteristics: “Sports,” “Aerobic exercise,” “Mind–body exercise,” 
“Mixed physical exercise,” “Exergaming,” “Specific training modality.” 
At the third level, the interventions were coded according to the 
specific type of exercise performed: “Football,” “Table tennis,” 
“Badminton,” “Tennis,” “Swimming,” “Cycle ergometer,” “Running,” 
“Yoga” etc. Lastly, interventions were coded at the intersection of a 
specific type with the following broad categories: open-skill activities 
(require participants to react in a dynamically changing and externally 
paced environment and promote the use of the brain while performing 
the task, such as football, table tennis, badminton, tennis); closed-skill 
activities (which require participants to perform in a highly consistent, 
stationary, and self-paced environment, such as swimming, running, 
cycle ergometer, rope skipping); multicomponent physical exercise 
(the combination of open-skill and closed-skill activities, such as 
swimming and racket sports); exergaming (the combination of 
physical and cognitive training in a gamified fashion); and specific 
training technique that do not target any particular movement (high-
intensity interval training, HIIT; moderate-intensity continuous 
training, MICT). For the intensity of the physical exercise, we defined 
low intensity (<60% HRmax/45% VO2max), moderate intensity 
(60–75% HRmax/45–65% VO2max), and vigorous intensity (>75% 
HRmax/65% VO2max).
2.6. Study quality assessment and quality of 
evidence
The methodological quality of the included RCTs and quasi-RCTs 
was assessed by two authors using the Physiotherapy Evidence 
Zhu et al.

Frontiers in Public Health

Database scale (PEDro) (25). Disagreements were discussed between 
the authors to reach a consensus. The PEDro scale contained 11 items, 
which included the eligibility criteria, random allocation, concealed 
allocation, baseline comparability, blind subjects, blind therapists, 
blind assessors, adequate follow-up, intention-to-treat analysis, and 
between-group comparisons as well as point estimates and variability. 
The minimum score was 0 points, and the maximum score was 10 
points. The score was categorized as follows: <4 points as poor quality, 
4 to 5 points as fair quality, 6 to 8 points as good quality, and 9 to 10 
points as excellent quality. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical 
Appraisal Tools was used to assess the quality and risk of bias of self-
control trials (26). The tool consists of 9 questions whose answers 
could be “yes,” “no,” “unclear,” and “not applicated.”
The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development 
and Evaluations (GRADE) system was used in this study to judge the 
quality of evidence (27). Based on the GRADE’s five downgraded 
criteria with reference to the risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, 
imprecision, and publication bias, we  determined whether to 
downgrade the quality level of the evidence. Ultimately, the certainty 
of the evidence was rated as high, moderate, low, and very low.
2.7. Statistical analysis
It was determined with the research steering committee that self-
controlled trials would be  included to capture data on emerging 
treatments and treatments tested in more pragmatic settings. If the 
included studies were self-controlled trials (pre-intervention vs. post-
intervention in one individual), we  used appropriate descriptive 
analyses to describe the individual and summarized the characteristics 
of these studies. Due to recruitment difficulties in a few studies, the 
authors used a quasi-RCT design, which participants were allocated 
to groups using nonrandom methods, and participants might have 
been recruited from the same school as one group. If randomized and 
nonrandomized exercise studies produced homogeneous effect size 
estimates, one could pool the results (28). Eventually, with the 
included studies being RCTs and quasi-RCT (without randomization 
but with baseline comparability), we performed a meta-analysis to 
evaluate the efficacy quantitatively.
First, a pairwise meta-analysis was performed across all outcomes 
to investigate the effects of various physical exercise interventions 
compared to the control group. For the conventional meta-analysis, 
the heterogeneity across studies was quantified using the I2 statistic, in 
which values of 25, 50, and 75% indicated mild, moderate, and high 
heterogeneity, respectively (29). When the heterogeneity was 
considerable (I2 ≥ 50%), a random-effects model was used. Forest plots 
were generated using R-evolution version 4.2.1.
The network meta-analysis with the frequentist model was 
performed by combining direct and indirect evidence from all the 
available studies. We used STATA 17.0 (Stata, College Station, TX, 
United States.) software within the ‘Network’ package to perform 
a multivariate random-effects meta-analysis, which can account for 
heterogeneity caused by clinical and other factors across studies 
and provide a more conservative confidence interval for pooled 
point estimates. The graphs of the network plot were presented, 
which showed the comparative relationships among the groups. 
Effect sizes were estimated with the standardized mean difference 
(SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using means and 
standard deviations of postintervention scores. According to the 
SMD statistic, Cohen’s categories were used to determine the 
magnitude of the effect size, with scores of d ≥ |0.8| being 
considered a large effect, ≥|0.5| to <|0.8| as medium, ≥|0.2| to 
<|0.5| as small and <|0.2| as trivial (30).
We assessed the network transitivity by comparing the clinical and 
methodological features to guarantee that multiple treatment 
comparisons were sufficiently similar. Inconsistency and consistency 
models were tested via the design by treatment interaction model (i.e., 
global approach) and node-splitting test (i.e., local approach), which 
determines the significant difference between direct and indirect 
comparisons for each treatment with the aim of assessing the 
consistency. Probability values were summarized and reported as the 
surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve. The SUCRA 
value would be 0 when a treatment is certain to be the worst and 1 
when it is certain to be the best. To evaluate the stability of the results, 
further sensitivity analyses were conducted by (1) excluding trials 
judged as poor and fair quality, (2) evaluating only RCTs and (3) being 
only written in English language. Subgroup analyses according to the 
different core components of executive functions were conducted. 
Moreover, we also conducted a meta-regression analysis (with the year 
of study, study design, age, medication use, frequency, intensity, 
duration, and length of physical exercise as covariates) for the 
outcomes. Publication bias and small-study effects were detected 
through an asymmetrical funnel plot.
Since there were many indirect comparisons in the network meta-
analysis, which may raise challenges in reaching appropriate 
conclusions, we used a partially contextualized framework to draw 
conclusions from a network meta-analysis according to published 
GRADE guidance (31). First, we  chose the intervention most 
connected to other interventions in the network and used that 
intervention as a reference (e.g., Controls). Second, we used the point 
estimate by comparing each of the interventions against the reference. 
Whether the confidence interval crosses the null would be irrelevant, 
because the NMA is more likely to have wide and imprecise estimates. 
Third, we  used the GRADE system to judge the certainty of the 
evidence for every intervention compared with the reference. Fourth, 
more importantly, we  checked the consistency between point 
estimates and SUCRA values. For example, an intervention with a 
large effect ranks higher than an intervention with a moderate effect; 
however, the first intervention has a considerably lower SUCRA value 
than the second intervention, which may be problematic.
3. Results
3.1. Descriptions of included studies
We identified 15,409 potentially eligible studies through the 
initial electronic database search and 8 studies through reference 
list checking in a manual search. Based on a screening of the title 
and abstract, 13,528 articles were discarded, and we considered 130 
potentially eligible studies for inclusion and retrieved their full-
text articles. Following application of the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, 59 studies (published between 1983 and 2022) including 
39 RCTs, 5 quasi-RCTs, and 15 self-controlled trials were selected 
for this systematic review. The PRISMA-NMA flow chart for study 
literature selection is given in Figure 1. The agreement rates for

study selection by reading the title and abstract and full-text review 
between two authors were 0.77 and 0.87, respectively 
(Appendix 2 S3 Tables S2, S3). Of the included studies, 23 
examined the effects of closed-skill activities with a focus on 
aerobic exercises (e.g., swimming, running, and cycle ergometer), 
19 examined the effects of multicomponent exercise, 12 examined 
the effects of open-skill activities (e.g., racket sports, football, and 
equestrian), 3 examined the effects of exergaming exercise, and 2 
examined the effects of HIIT. In total, 44 studies (26 studies for 
executive functions, 11 studies for symptoms, and 7 studies for 
both) with 1757 participants were selected to perform the network 
meta-analysis quantitatively. The median length of therapy was 
12 weeks, and each session lasted 45 min. The physical exercise 
intensity was mostly moderate or moderate-to-vigorous. Regarding 
regions, 20 studies were conducted in East Asia, 12  in North 
America, 10 in Europe, and 7 in Africa; the remaining studies were 
conducted in other regions. A total of 8 studies did not report the 
participants’ sex, and the ratio of male to female was about 4:1. The 
characteristics of the studies included in this systematic review are 
presented in Table 1.
3.2. Methodological quality
Using the PEDro tool, the total score ranged from 4 to 8 points, 
which indicated a fair (22.7%) to good (77.3%) quality 
(Appendix 2 S4 Table S4). As we know, it was very difficult to meet 
high quality criteria in exercise studies in which neither the provider 
or patients nor outcome assessor could be blinded, and these studies 
failed to meet the blinding of participants and outcome assessment 
guidelines. Additionally, only one study used allocation concealment. 
For the JBI appraisal, we  assessed one study as being of poor 
methodological quality because of very serious risk of bias 
(Appendix 2 S4 Table S5).
3.3. Outcome-executive functions
The NMA of executive functions included 33 studies and 1,289 
participants. Pairwise meta-analyses for various physical exercise and 
the control group comparisons were provided with detailed individual 
trial-level information, summarized in Appendix 2 S5 Table S6.

Overall results indicated that physical exercise can effectively improve 
executive functions compared with the control group (SMD = 1.15, 
95% CI: 0.83 to 1.46), with an overall I2 value of 79.0%. The therapeutic 
effects from the various physical exercise interventions ranged from 
medium to large. The network plot for executive functions (Figure 2) 
showed all the available comparisons from the included studies. In 
Figure 2, all the physical exercise interventions were directly compared 
with non-physical exercise controls, and direct comparisons between 
closed-skill activities and open-skill activities as well as exergaming 
were lacking. Inconsistency network models were used to test the 
global consistency of direct and indirect effects for pairwise and 
multi-arm comparisons simultaneously, revealing no significant 
global inconsistency (p > 0.05; Appendix 2 S6 Figure S1). The results 
of the network meta-analysis indicated that all types of physical 
exercise interventions except exergaming were superior to 
non-physical exercise controls, with SMDs ranging from 1.01 (95% 
CI: 0.48 to 1.55) for multicomponent physical exercise to 1.96 (95% 
CI: 1.15 to 2.77) for open-skill activities. The ranking of the physical 
exercise interventions based on cumulative probability plots and 
SUCRAs is shown in Appendix 2 S6 Figure S2. Open-skill activities 
showed the greatest improvement in executive functions, with a 
SUCRA value of 98.0% (Figure  2). The league table of outcome 
analyses for executive functions is given in Figure 3. Our subgroup 
analysis on three core components of executive functions revealed 
some inconsistent results (Appendix 2 S7 Figures S3–S13). For 
inhibitory control, open-skill activities were still the most promising 
physical exercise type, with a SUCRA value of 99.1% (SMD = 1.94, 
95% CI: 1.24 to 2.64). Closed-skill activities possessed the greatest 
likelihood of being the best intervention for working memory 
(SUCRA = 75.9%, SMD = 1.21, and 95% CI: −0.22 to 2.65), along with 
the suboptimal intervention multicomponent physical exercise 
(SUCRA = 71.3%, SMD = 1.05, and 95% CI: 0.19 to 1.92). However, for 
cognitive flexibility, multicomponent physical exercise (with a mean 
rank of 2.2) had a slightly higher probability of being the most 
promising physical exercise treatment (SUCRA = 70.3%, SMD = 1.44, 
and 95% CI: −0.19 to 3.07). The sparseness of the network led to wide 
confidence intervals for some treatment comparisons. Sensitivity 
analyses showed that the significant result of this network meta-
analysis was not unduly influenced by the study quality. Comparison-
adjusted funnel plots failed to provide evidence of obvious publication

bias (Appendix 2 S8 Figures S14–16). Based on the results of the meta-
regression analyses, no significant modifying effects were found for 
the year of study, study design and quality, ages, medication use, 
frequency, intensity, duration, and length of physical exercise 
intervention, indicating that the assumption of transitivity was upheld. 
The 
meta-regression 
analysis 
results 
can 
be 
found 
in 
Appendix 2 S9 Figure S17. The certainty of this evidence was judged 
to be high to very low overall (Appendix 2 S10 Table S7).
3.4. Outcome-major symptoms
The NMA on major symptoms included 18 studies and 823 
participants. Pairwise meta-analyses for various physical exercise and 
the 
control 
group 
comparisons 
were 
summarized 
in 
Appendix 2 S5 Table S6. Overall findings showed that physical 
exercise interventions were effective at improving hyperactivity/
impulsivity (SMD = −1.01, 95% CI: −1.65 to −0.36) symptoms with 
a large effect, and they improve inattention (SMD = −0.65, 95% CI: 
−1.11 to −0.20) symptoms with a moderate effect, with overall I2 
values of 88.0 and 81.0%, respectively. The network plots of the 
intervention comparisons are shown in Figures 4, 5, which indicated 
that all the physical exercise interventions were directly compared 
with non-physical exercise controls. No significant inconsistency was 
found in hyperactivity/impulsivity (Appendix 2 S11 Figure S18) and 
inattention (Appendix 2 S12 Figure S20), and the assumption of 
consistency was satisfied for the overall level of each treatment 
(p > 0.05). The results of our network meta-analysis suggested that 
closed-skill activities possessed the greatest likelihood of being the 
best intervention, with a SUCRA value of 72.5% for hyperactivity/
impulsivity (SMD = −1.60, 95% CI: −3.02 to −0.19) and 96.3% for 
inattention (SMD = −1.51, 95% CI: −2.33 to −0.69). League tables of 
outcome analyses for hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention are 
presented in Figures  6, 7. The ranking of the physical exercise 
interventions based on cumulative probability plots and SUCRAs is 
shown in Appendix 2 S11 Figure S19 and Appendix 2 S12 Figure S21. 
Sensitivity analyses showed that the results of this network 
meta-analysis were stable. We did not detect obvious publication bias 
based on the funnel plots (Appendix 2 S13 Figures S22, S23). 
Transitivity was explored using meta-regression sensitivity analyses. 
The meta-regression results indicated that frequency and duration per 
session were moderators on the effects of closed-skill activities for 
major symptoms (Appendix 2 S14 Figures S24, S25). The certainty of 
this evidence was judged to be  high to very low overall 
(Appendix 2 S15 Tables S8, S9). A partially contextualized framework 
used for the classification of interventions based on network meta-
analysis is shown in Appendix 2 S16 Table S10, showing no conflicting 
results were yielded.
4. Discussion
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a neurobiologically 
based condition that interferes with a person’s ability to sustain 
attention, control impulsive behavior, and focus on a task (41). Seiffer 
et al. revealed that moderate-intensity physical activity can be an 
alternate treatment for ADHD (19, 24). Our previous studies also 
confirmed that physical exercise intervention could relieve ADHD-
related symptoms and improve executive functions (16, 17). However, 
previously published literature lacks a comparison of different physical 
exercise modalities for children and adolescents with ADHD. The 
results from this network meta-analysis reconfirmed the beneficial 
effects of various physical exercise interventions on executive 
functions and ADHD-related symptoms and provided little evidence 
that open-skill activities which require participants to react in a 
dynamically changing and externally paced environment had the 
highest probability of being the most promising physical exercise 
treatment for improving executive functions, particularly in inhibitory 
control, while closed-skill activities dominated by aerobic exercises 
tended to be the most effective in helping working memory and 
multicomponent physical exercise tended to be the most effective in 
helping cognitive flexibility. Closed-skill activities dominated by 
aerobic exercises possessed the greatest likelihood of being the best 
intervention for ADHD-related symptoms. Our findings should

be  interpreted with caution, because limited quality and direct 
evidence were highly represented among the included studies.
According to empirical studies, participating in physical activity 
boosts arousal levels, cerebral blood flow, and neurotransmitter 
production (e.g., dopamine), all of which help to improve cognitive 
functions (87). Engaging in physical activity and exercise also provides 
a learning experience necessary for proper cognitive development, 
and these learning processes may inherently reinforce executive 
functions (88). For instance, when children are playing football, they 
need to pay attention, remember instructions, and often inhibit 
irrelevant behaviors from the environment, ensuring that they 
perform a particular movement or activity successfully (69), which is 
closely related to the use of executive functions, such as inhibitory 
control (17, 43). For ADHD-related symptoms, studies have reported 
that exercises might augment the synthesis and release of dopamine 
and other catecholamines in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, 
caudate nucleus, and basal ganglia (89), and the underlying 
mechanism for physical exercise interventions to relieve inattentive 
symptoms may be primarily associated with increased dopamine 
levels in the brain.
The primary distinction in earlier studies was the type of physical 
activity, ranging from racket sports to aerobics and high-intensity 
interval training to exergames. In contrast, we conducted a network 
meta-analysis comparing different physical exercise modalities for 
children and adolescents with ADHD to provide the best evidence of 
efficacy. In this study, we  did not categorize physical exercise 
modalities as aerobic, resistance and endurance training in the 
traditional way but innovatively divided them into open-skill and 
closed-skill activities. It is reasonable to assume that this is a more 
child-friendly classification method. It has been proposed that the 
environment within which the activity is performed is the primary 
difference between open and closed skill exercises (90). When 
compared to closed-skill activities, open-skill activities demand a 
higher level of executive control in advance anticipation (e.g., online 
updating of external changes and predicting related outcomes) and 
imperative responses (e.g., initiating in-time actions in response to 
external changes, including the initiation of appropriate actions and 
the inhibition of inappropriate actions) due to the changing 
environment and diversity of responses under high time pressure (91). 
In contrast, closed-skill activities make individuals tend to follow set

patterns and hence be more consistent. Our results preliminarily 
indicated that open-skill activities were more beneficial for EFs, 
particularly in inhibitory control. Ball sports are typical open-skill 
activities, and it is postulated that exercise and sports associated with 
cognitively challenging tasks (e.g., table tennis and soccer) have a 
significant impact on executive functions (87). These findings were 
consistent with our previous findings that 6 weeks of football exercise 
helped to improve the executive functions of ADHD children, 
primarily in inhibitory control. Open-skill activities require 
participants to exercise in a dynamic, unpredictable, and external 
rhythm environment, which has higher requirements for their sports 
coordination ability. The higher the requirement of the sports 
coordination ability for the involved movement, the higher the 
cognitive load given to the brain, and therefore, the nervous system 
will be more stimulated. Therefore, long-term participation in open-
skill activities may cause the neural network to be  more closely 
connected, thus stimulating the enhancement of inhibitory function 
(92). Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that executive function is a 
generic term for a series of advanced cognitive functions, including 
planning, inhibition, self-regulation, flexibility and other components, 
which is categorized into three elements: inhibitory control, working 
memory, and cognitive flexibility, of which inhibitory control is the 
most essential component (93). Consistent with a previous meta-
analysis, physical exercise interventions resulted in the largest effect 
size on inhibitory control (94), and most forms of physical exercise 
were effective at improving inhibitory control. Participants need to use 
their inhibitory control to follow instructions and stay on task when 
they participate in physical exercise, and inhibitory control plays a 
critical role for young children, in which it emerges first as the ability 
to ignore irrelevant stimuli due to the nature of environmental 
distractions (95, 96). When youths have reached a particular degree 
of inhibitory control development, they may be better able to use other 
executive function elements, such as working memory and shifting 
(95, 96). Furthermore, inhibitory control may be more sensitive than 
other EF components (e.g., switching) to the effect of physical exercise 
during childhood (97). In fact, the bulk of the included studies in the 
current meta-analysis were on children and adolescents, which may 
be one of the reasons why the largest effect on inhibitory control was 
found (87).
Working memory is the ability to hold things in mind (98). For 
the working memory of EFs, closed-skill activities showed 
significant effects and were superior to others based on their 
SUCRA values. Most of the closed-skill activities mentioned in our 
included studies were aerobic exercises, including simple running, 
treadmill exercise, and cycling on an ergometer. The improvement 
in working memory is related to the enhancement of aerobic 
fitness. Some studies have shown that working memory and the 
level of brain activation in young students significantly improve 
after acute and chronic aerobic exercise (92). In our network meta-
analysis results, the first-ranked closed-skill activities were not 
significant, but the second-ranked multicomponent physical 
exercise was significant when compared to the control group. 
According to our current understanding, in the network meta-
analysis, the ranking based on the SUCRA value and the 
significance of relative effects based on the point estimate and 
confidence interval are independent of one another. Ranking the 
effectiveness of interventions is a major strength of network meta-
analysis, and the SUCRA method is most frequently used. 
Nevertheless, SUCRA does not consider the magnitude of 
differences in effects between treatments, particularly in a 
simulation in which the first-ranked treatment may be only slightly 
better than the second-ranked treatment (99). One contributing 
factor may be attributed to the complexity of the network meta-
analysis, in which some single interventions may result in a 
significant (or nonsignificant) effect; however, this interpretation 
is weakened when considering other interventions in a comparative 
analysis, especially when the network meta-analysis involves more 
than three or four interventions, and the cognitive challenge of 
optimally interpreting these evidence summaries is daunting (99, 
100). As we mentioned before, the confidence interval crossing the 
null would be irrelevant in the NMA, because the NMA is more 
likely to have wide and imprecise estimates.
For the cognitive flexibility of EFs, multicomponent physical 
exercise showed significant effects superior to others based on SUCRA 
values. Cognitive flexibility refers to the cognitive function of 
switching from one mode of behavior and pattern of thinking to 
another (101), which plays a fundamental role in almost all complex 
cognitive behaviors. The variety and complexity of task 
transformations help facilitate the cognitive processing of cognitive 
flexibility. Previous studies justified that mixed exercises were more 
likely to yield beneficial training effects on children’s EFs than aerobic 
exercise alone (102). Alvarez-Bueno et al. found that qualitatively 
FIGURE 7

enriched and quantitatively enhanced exercise benefitted different 
cognitive domains (103). Compared to the single form of physical 
exercise, multicomponent physical exercise is richer and requires a 
higher degree of cognitive processing. Some mechanisms have been 
proposed to explain the effects of multicomponent physical exercise 
on cognitive function, which suggests that the impact of 
multicomponent physical exercise on cognition implies different paths 
and supports the existence of a complex brain axis. The association 
between multicomponent physical exercise and brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a factor that promotes the growth and 
differentiation of neurons and supports the survival of existing 
neurons, was previously explored (104). Multicomponent physical 
exercise is the most recommended type of physical intervention in 
older adults (104), and whether it is most effective in supporting 
cognitive flexibility in ADHD children deserves further exploration 
by direct evidence comparison.
Physical exercise can increase coordination between the brain 
regions necessary for distributing attention and other specific areas, 
assisting children with ADHD in processing external information and 
enhancing attention. Regular physical exercise can also promote the 
activity of adrenal hormone receptors and enhance dopamine and 
norepinephrine production and secretion, resulting in improved 
concentration. Previous research demonstrated that mixed exercises 
were more likely than single aerobic exercise to relieve the symptoms 
of ADHD (102). This result was not consistent with our findings. Our 
analyses revealed that closed-skill activities, which were accessible in 
daily life, ranked first instead of multicomponent physical exercise. It 
may be that regular closed-skill physical exercise helps children with 
ADHD form a directional action pattern, standardize their behavior, 
and become less impulsive and aggressive (24). In a rat model of 
ADHD, one study found that swimming could reduce hyperactivity, 
impulsivity, and aggressive behavior while also improving short-term 
memory. The possible mechanism by which swimming ameliorates 
ADHD symptoms occurs by upregulating dopamine levels and 
downregulating dopamine D2 receptor expression (105). There is a 
lack of dopamine in an ADHD brain, and exercising provides a 
natural dopamine boost that can ease symptoms of ADHD. Aerobic 
exercise is a great way to regulate dopamine levels. Additionally, there 
may be  a number of factors that limit the effectiveness of 
multicomponent physical exercise. First, it might be challenging to 
guarantee that each exercise component is performed for the 
recommended duration and frequency when several are performed 
consecutively and sequentially, which in turn could weaken its positive 
effects (21). In addition, combining different exercise components 
could make the intervention more complicated to conduct and have a 
negative influence on intervention fidelity (the consistency between 
plan and execution) (21), especially for ADHD children. Physical 
activities are entertaining and well organized, which also helps with 
concentration, and minors may be more inclined to enjoy activities 
that are fun and simple. This is also the reason why no significant 
effect of HIIT was observed in our study. HITT is a form of exercise 
known as interval training comprises repeated bursts of high-intensity 
effort and a range of recuperation durations (13). It is hypothesized 
that it may make children bored and tired. The content of the physical 
exercise should increase the motivation and participation of children 
with ADHD (13).
In our study, we  searched multiple databases to ensure that 
we identified as many relevant studies as possible. In addition, there 
were no publication restrictions for the included studies, and studies 
published in English and other languages were within the range of our 
analysis, thereby increasing the strength of the analysis. However, 
some limitations must be considered when interpreting our findings. 
First, the number of studies focused on ADHD-related symptoms in 
children and adolescents is still limited. In addition, compared with 
the direct comparison, the statistical power of the indirect comparison 
is lower, the range of the confidence interval is wider, and the more 
common controls were passed through indirect comparisons, in 
which the analysis error is also increased (106). To provide more 
direct evidence about the relative effectiveness of the various physical 
exercise therapies, more multi-arm RCTs should be conducted in the 
future. Second, the findings may be subject to different measurement 
methods, leading to heterogeneous results. Although we  used 
subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis to explore some of the 
sources of heterogeneity, there were nevertheless some moderators at 
the individual level. Third, the optimal dose and minimal threshold 
for the beneficial effect of physical exercise on executive functions and 
major symptoms in children and adolescents with ADHD have not 
been substantially discussed in the literature reviewed.
The findings in our study have some important implications for 
public health and education. Physical exercise is malleable, and 
improved physical exercise can result in improved executive functions 
and major symptoms, which may lead to better performance in school 
and home and even better quality of life for children and adolescents 
with ADHD (87, 107). Therefore, the need for physical exercise 
opportunities should be  highlighted for individuals with 
ADHD. Furthermore, the choice and design of the physical exercise 
modality should be individualized based on the children’s current level 
of function deficits, simultaneously taking into account the fun of the 
physical exercise and attracting the attention of children.
5. Conclusion
Physical exercise can effectively improve executive functions and 
alleviate major symptoms in children and adolescents with ADHD 
with no side effects. Our preliminary findings revealed that open-skill 
activities requiring participants to react in a dynamically changing and 
externally paced environment induced the greatest benefits for 
executive functions, particularly in terms of inhibitory control. In 
contrast, closed-skill activities dominated by aerobic exercises tended 
to be  the most effective in supporting working memory, and 
multicomponent physical exercise tended to be the most effective in 
promoting cognitive flexibility. Closed-skill activities dominated by 
aerobic exercises might be  more advantageous for hyperactivity/
impulsivity and inattention symptom improvement. Future 
interventions should consider these findings during the design of 
physical exercise interventions and programs. Nevertheless, these 
results should be interpreted with caution given the limitations of our 
meta-analysis mentioned above.
