ABSTRACT.
Significance:
Wavefront shaping (WFS) can compensate for distortions by
optimizing the wavefront of the input light or reversing the transmission matrix of
the media. It is a promising field of research. A thorough understanding of principles
and developments of WFS is important for optical research.
Aim: To provide insight into WFS for researchers who deal with scattering in
biomedicine, imaging, and optical communication, our study summarizes the basic
principles and methods of WFS and reviews recent progress.
Approach: The basic principles, methods of WFS, and the latest applications of
WFS in focusing, imaging, and multimode fiber (MMF) endoscopy are described.
The practical challenges and prospects of future development are also discussed.
Results: Data-driven learning-based methods are opening up new possibilities for
WFS. High-resolution imaging through MMFs can support small-diameter endos-
copy in the future.
Conclusion: The rapid development of WFS over the past decade has shown that
the best solution is not to avoid scattering but to find ways to correct it or even use it.

1 Introduction
Light can carry and process information in parallel in multiple degrees of freedom, such as
space, time, wavelength, amplitude, phase, and polarization. Therefore, it has been an essential
tool for information observation, transmission, and compilation in the last several decades.
Optical techniques are indispensable, from tracking the trajectory of stars in astronomy, to
observing the microscopic structure of cells in biomedicine. But if light propagates in a scatter-
ing environment, such as disordered materials, biological tissues, and multimode fibers
(MMFs), the inhomogeneous distributions of refractive indices will add random distortions
to the carried information.1–3 This phenomenon significantly deteriorates the performance of
traditional optical techniques. Biomedicine is particularly affected. High-resolution imaging
and high-precision laser therapy often rely on ballistic photons or quasiballistic photons4–6
because they can achieve coherent and tight focusing. However, scattering in biological tissues

causes the number of ballistic photons to decay exponentially with propagation depth, limiting
optical focusing and direct imaging to a depth of ∼1 to 2 mm.7 At the depths of more than one
optical transport mean-free path, ballistic photons are rare, and fully developed speckles become
dominant. Thus for a long time, overcoming scattering to make the turbid medium “transparent”
has been urgently needed.
The phenomenon of scattering events exhibiting determinism with the speckle decorrelation
window is called the memory effect.8–10 Although the scattering transmission of ballistic photons
is highly complex, there is no irreversible loss of the carried information. If the scrambled infor-
mation in the scattered light can be successfully retrieved and rearranged, the “transparency” of
the medium may be achieved. Based on this, Vellekoop and Mosk developed wavefront shaping
(WFS).11 The phase control pattern of the spatial light modulator is optimized by an iterative
algorithm, and the precompensation information is introduced into the input light.12–15 A focused
spot can be successfully obtained behind the scattering medium. A transmission matrix (TM)
model describing the linear relationship between the input and output light has also been
established.16–19 By measuring the TM, the scattering distortion can be precompensated to obtain
the desired output. In addition, time-reversing the scattered field can also restore the speckle to the
original incident wavefront.20–23 In the past decade, thanks to the development of highly adjustable
spatial light modulators, such as liquid crystal,11 microelectromechanical,24 and acousto-optic
modulators,25 especially the increase in the number of controllable modes and modulation rates,
a large amount of research on WFS has emerged.
WFS has provided a powerful tool for biomedicine. By manipulating large-scale optical
modes with high resolution, WFS allows the construction of diffraction-limited spatiotemporal
focusing behind opaque biological tissues.26 Furthermore, guidance with ultrasound, which pro-
duces a focus much deeper than light in the medium, can help to focus light inside turbid tissues
without invasive manipulation.27 The high-resolution and high-contrast antiscattering focusing
based on WFS increases the penetration depth of two-photon microscopy,28 optical coherence
tomography,29 and fluorescence imaging,30 promising noninvasive diagnosis and treatment,31
and benefiting the development of phototherapy and optogenetics. MMF only has a diameter
of a few hundred microns but can support tens of thousands of optical modes. But the inherent
mode crosstalk makes it impossible to directly image but produces speckles similar to multiple
scattering. WFS can compensate for the crosstalk, thereby subtly converting MMFs into endo-
scopic fibers for minimally invasive imaging of living cells and tissues. Thus WFS accelerates the
deployment of MMFs to endoscopic imaging.32
In this review, we introduce the principles of WFS, including the concept of light scattering
and three basic methods. Then we review the latest developments in the field of focusing, im-
aging, and MMF. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and prospects of WFS.
2 Basic Principles of WFS
2.1 Multiple Scattering
Affected by the inhomogeneity of the microscopic refractive indices of the medium, photons on
different paths experience different phase delays, and the transmission directions are deflected to
different degrees [Fig. 1(a)]. Therefore, ballistic photons decrease sharply during propagation,
and the scattered light of different paths interferes randomly, forming a speckle pattern with
chaotic intensity distribution.1 Generally, the absorption coefficient μa is used to describe a frac-
tional decrease in the light intensity per unit distance traveled due to absorption, and the scatter-
ing mean free path of scattering ls is used to represent the average distance between two adjacent
scattering events.33 ls quantifies the scattering strength of the scattering medium. After the
distance known as the transport mean free path l ¼ ls∕ð1 − gÞ, the propagation path of the
scattered light becomes sufficiently random, completely losing correlation with the original
trajectory.2 g is the anisotropy factor of the scattering medium and represents the average value
of the cosine of the light deflection angle θ during the scattering events. The anisotropy factor of
biological tissue is typically ∼0.9,31 which means that the forward scattering is dominant. The
transport mean free path is typically 0.1 to 1 mm, and the observed speckle patterns are basically
the result of multiple scattering.

Theoretically, the transport of light can be described by the wave equation, as can multiple
scattering. However, the complexity of multiple scattering makes it nearly impossible to obtain a
complete numerical solution. However, there are correlations between multiple scatterings. The
same input can result in an unchanged speckle response. When the input changes slightly in tilt,
the speckle pattern maintains a high degree of similarity, i.e., memory effect.34 It should be noted
that the memory effect is valid within the speckle correlation time.1 Once there is a disturbance,
the scattering transformation will quickly decorrelate. The transformation of the light field before
and after scattering is deterministic. If the optimal inputs can be constructed according to the
transformation, it will be possible to obtain the desired output through scattering.
Mesoscopic transport35 and random matrix theory36 provide a solution for the quantitative
analysis of multiple scattering. In the spatial domain, the input and output fields of the scattering
medium can be represented by Einn and Eout
m , respectively (with n ¼ 1; : : : ; N and m ¼ 1; : : : ; M).
n and m are the optical channels or modes. For a system with a surface area A, theoretically, the
maximum number of spatial modes allowed for the input and output is Nm ≈ 2πA∕λ2, where λ is
the wavelength of light.37 In practice, N and M depend on the discrete resolution and the finite
field. The transformation between input and output can be described by a linear complex TM T,
i.e., Eout
m ¼ P tmnEinn or Eout ¼ TEin. The TM indicates that a channel of the scattered output is
the weighted sum of all input channels.16 When the input is a plane wave, the output depends on
the entire matrix. Since the results of multiple scattering are fully developed speckles, where
channels or modes are highly uncorrelated, each element of the TM is close to a random variable,
generally obeying a circularly symmetric Gaussian distribution. The TM expression can also be
modified to represent a reflective matrix not limited to the transmissive forward scattering.38
2.2 WFS via TM Engineering
The TM describes the linear relationship between the light before and after scattering [Fig. 1(b)].
If each element of the matrix can be accurately obtained, all the scattering events can be analyzed,
and any scattering output can be achieved using a specially designed input. Therefore, measuring
the TM to compensate for the scattering distortion is the focus of WFS. At present, there are two
major methods for measuring the TM of scattering media, namely the interferometric method39–42
and the noninterferometric method.43–46 The former is first demonstrated by Popoff et al.16 They
loaded the orthonormal basis as the input to the spatial light modulator sequentially. The camera
detected the interference between the speckle output of each basis and the additional reference
beam. The complex amplitude information of the detection was analyzed by the phase-shifting

scattering medium is used as the feedback to optimize the modulation pattern of the spatial light
modulator by the algorithm, and the desired output is finally obtained. (d) OPC. Time-reverse

method, and finally the TM was obtained by specific calculation.16 In Popoff’s method, since the
reference beam and the signal beam came from the same path, it was also called self-reference
measurement. Additionally, introducing an external reference for phase shifting or holographic
measurement can also be used for the measurement. The noninterferometric method is first
demonstrated by Drémeau et al., mainly relying on phase retrieval algorithms to infer the ele-
ments of the TM from a large number of input patterns and corresponding speckle outputs.47 The
phase retrieval algorithms are mostly driven by Bayes’ theorem,43 and the measurement of TM is
completed with many iterations. Due to the antinoise performance, the noninterferometric
method is currently a popular research.
Once measured, the TM T can be used to analyze and control the light propagating through
the scattering medium. By analyzing the eigenvectors of T†T, the transmission eigenchannel,
complete control of the light transmission in the scattering medium can be achieved.48 By
inverting the TM via Ein ¼ T−1Eout, the input wavefront that should be modulated can be calcu-
lated according to the target output, or the hidden input can be recovered from the output
speckle.49,50 In practice, the inverse of the matrix is often replaced by the conjugate transpose
T† or some other operators.51 Although not exactly equivalent, it is more stable than direct inver-
sion. Because the goal of antiscattering focusing is to form a single focus at one fixed target
location, it is not necessary to measure the entire TM. The optimal input wavefront is only related
to a certain column of the TM. Therefore, the measurement error tolerance is high. However,
recovering the input image from the speckle, or constructing a specific output requires more
accurate measurement, because almost all elements of the TM are used in the calculation.
But due to various issues, such as the limited number of optical modes and unstable interfer-
ometry, the implementation of these complex tasks is quite difficult and often requires additional
help from iterative or learning-based methods.52,53
In order to control more degrees of freedom of the scattered light, a lot of expansions of the
complex amplitude TM method have been developed. For example, the control of polarization
allows the construction of vector beams for optical tweezers,54 increasing the information capac-
ity of MMFs.55 Based on the polarization coupling effect of scattering, and the fact that the
scattered vector field is the summation of the intensities of two fully developed speckles in two
orthogonal polarization states,51 researchers extend the linear transformation relationship to a two
by two dimension,56 which means a pair of inputs in two orthogonal polarization states becomes
a pair of scattered outputs. In addition to the spatial degrees of freedom, spectral and time
resolved transmission matrices can also be obtained using monochromatic measurement at multi-
ple frequencies,57,58 or low-coherence measurement in a broad spectrum of light.59,60 Then
frequency-dependent focusing and spatiotemporal focusing can be achieved.
2.3 Iteration-Based WFS
Iteration-based WFS uses the field distribution at the target position as the feedback to search and
optimize the modulation pattern of the spatial light modulator with iterative algorithms
[Fig. 1(c)]. It can gradually optimize the incident light and guide the scattered light to generate
the target field through the scattering medium.11,61 This method was the first demonstration of
WFS. In the implementation of iteration-based WFS, taking focusing as an example, detection
devices, such as cameras or photomultiplier tubes, are used to monitor and detect the light inten-
sity of the target focusing position. The iterative algorithm takes the detected light intensity as
feedback and completes the optimization.61–65 Finally, the one with the highest feedback is deter-
mined as the best modulation pattern, and a highly enhanced antiscattering focusing can be
obtained.
The iteration-based method can be used to overcome the diffraction limit of a conventional
imaging system and generate enhanced focusing,66,67 without complex interference techniques.
For iteration-based WFS, imaging a large field-of-view often requires focus scanning.1,68 It gen-
erally relies on the memory effect. However, the effective range of memory effect is small, which
leads to a limited imaging field of view and depth. Constructing a movable guide star, such as
ultrasound,69 can achieve deep imaging without the aid of memory effects, but the focal spot is
several orders of magnitude larger than the optical diffraction limited focus.66,70 The imaging
resolution and contrast are typically insufficient. Recently, a model-based method has been pro-
posed to achieve the focusing at any spatial location by calculating the refractive index model of

Vol. 29(S1)
the scattering medium.71 But this method requires strong prior knowledge, and its practicability
needs further exploration.
The exploration of advanced noninvasive feedback is another important direction for
iteration-based methods.27 In practice, cameras cannot be used to provide feedback inside the
scattering medium. However, there is an urgent need to achieve optical focusing and imaging
inside biological tissues. Therefore, internal guide stars have been proposed, such as fluorescence
markers,72 photoswitchable proteins,73 magnetic particles,74 and microbubbles.75 The fluorescent
marker was employed in the medium as the earliest guide star.72 The fluorescence signal outside
the medium is detected as feedback to optimize the focused spot. In addition, people have pro-
posed several noninvasive guide stars, such as coherence gating76 and particle displacement.77
Recently, acousto-optic feedback methods have been extensively studied,66,69,78–80 as ultrasound
can propagate deep in biological tissue. In addition, the acoustic signal generated via the photo-
acoustic effect inside the scattering medium as the feedback was also explored.29,81 Moreover,
people can also focus ultrasound in the medium to induce acousto-optic modulation to shift the
light frequency and detect the shift as the feedback to achieve noninvasive focusing.69
2.4 Optical Phase Conjugation
The analytical solution of the wave equation has time-reversal symmetry.37 It means that if the
phase conjugate field of the scattered field propagates back to the scattering medium, the initial
incident field can be restored [Fig. 1(d)]. When the incident light comes from a specific point
source, the time-reversed light is refocused at that location. This method based on time-reversal is
called optical phase conjugation (OPC). OPC was first demonstrated in analog devices, such as
acoustic time-reversal mirrors82,83 and optical nonlinear crystal.84,85 Digital methods of interfer-
ence recording and spatial light modulation can be alternatives to analog methods to achieve
optical focusing through turbid media.20
Compared with the TM and iteration-based WFS, the wavefront information to be modu-
lated can be determined by OPC with only one measurement, significantly reducing the time
consumption. It can achieve a fast response of millisecond or submillisecond level.86 But
OPC also introduces a system alignment challenge. This challenge stems from two major imple-
mentation steps of OPC: recording of scattered optical fields, and playback of phase-conjugate
optical fields. In a typical implementation, the camera records the interference patterns of the
scattered light and the reference light, and the complex amplitude of the scattered light is calcu-
lated. Then the spatial light modulator displays the corresponding pattern to generate the phase-
conjugate field and trace it back to the scattering medium. In this process, the pixels of the record-
ing camera and the playback modulator need to be matched one by one, so that the time-reversal
can be accurately achieved,23 adding complexity to the implementation of OPC. One possible
solution is to design a unique device with both detection and modulation functions.1 In addition,
to achieve the focus inside the scattering medium, the guide stars, such as ultrasound, are also
required.73,76,87
3 Application of WFS
3.1 Focusing and Imaging
Clinical imaging technologies, such as ultrasound imaging29 and magnetic resonance imaging,1
can penetrate biological tissues to obtain macroscopic images. But their spatial resolution is
orders of magnitude lower than optical microscopy. In general, the scattering properties in
biological tissues are wavelength-dependent.88 As the wavelength increases, the transport mean
free path becomes longer. Near-infrared light can reach a penetration depth of several millimeters
to centimeters.89 But conventional optical techniques using visible or near-infrared light, such as
multiphoton microscopy,90 still rely on ballistic photons, limiting the imaging depth to 1 to 2 mm.
Using scattered light rather than the almost nonexistent ballistic light is a better choice to solve
the problem in biological tissues. The rapidly developed WFS makes it possible to achieve focus-
ing and imaging through thick scattering media and even in living tissues.
Fast and highly enhanced focusing inside scattering media has been the focus of research. In
general, the energy gain of light focusing is affected by the number of effective modulation
modes. However, increasing the number of modes reduces the speed of focusing. This trade-off

is particularly prominent in TM and iteration-based methods.1 Digital micromirror devices
(DMDs) with high refresh rates are used to replace the traditional liquid crystal modulator,
greatly improving the focusing speed.18 However, DMDs can only control the binary amplitude
of light, then the focusing quality is reduced. A variety of binary coding methods have been
proposed, such as Lee holographic method91 and superpixel method,92,93 to improve the modu-
lation dimension of DMD to the complex amplitude. But these methods sacrifice the number of
modes. In addition, polarization has also been taken into account, and WFS is carried out in two
orthogonal polarization directions.23,94,95 On the one hand, the number of modes was cleverly
increased by two times. On the other hand, it enables WFS to control polarization, another impor-
tant degree of freedom of light. Recently, a WFS technique that simultaneously achieves high-
speed, high-energy gain, and high-modulation mode number has been proposed96 [Fig. 2(a)]. By
combining photorefractive crystal-based analog OPC and stimulated emission amplification, the
focusing energy gain is increased by three orders of magnitude, and the speed is improved by
more than 50 times. Light focusing in a living mouse ear has been achieved. It promises optical
focusing for biomedical applications.
Focusing light in the scattering medium, such as biological tissue, requires guide stars
in vivo.27 Since the scattering effect of ultrasound is about 1000 times weaker than that of
light, a new concept of optical focusing based on ultrasonic encoding was first proposed and
applied to WFS.69 It is noninvasive and moveable. Because this method uses the focus of ultra-
sound in the tissue to guide the focus of coherent light, the resolution of optical focus is limited
by the ultrasonic focus.42 In order to improve the resolution, some methods, including variance
coding time inversion97 and nonlinear ultrasonic guided iterative optimization66 have been
proposed. These methods break the ultrasonic resolution limit and realize the optical diffrac-
tion-limited focusing. Since only a small amount of frequency-shifted first-order diffracted
photons are useful for focusing, it reduces the focusing efficiency and peak-to-background
ratio. Recently, it has been found that the brighter zeroth-order diffracted light, which was
previously considered useless or even harmful, has a field perturbation effect80 [Fig. 2(b)].

Vol. 29(S1)
When switching the ultrasonic guide star on and off alternately, the differential field can be
detected, thereby guiding the light to focus to the location of the field disturbance, improving
the efficiency and flexibility of light focusing.
The most straightforward method of translating focusing to imaging is raster scanning,
which can be combined with fluorescent labeling to realize the imaging of microstructure
by scanning the focus.98 It can also replace the time-gated method by modulating the light to
compensate for the scattering of the wall and form a focus to scan hidden objects, to achieve
non-line-of-sight imaging99 [Fig. 3(a)]. Because the focus of WFS can be close to the diffraction
limit, the imaging resolution can be significantly improved. In addition, the memory effect
makes it possible to achieve imaging without scanning focus100 [Fig. 3(b)]. This method can
reconstruct the hidden objects in the scattering environment using the speckle correlation
calculation method without complex optimization of the wavefront. However, it should be noted
that such methods only can image small objects in the narrow-angle range where the memory
effect takes effect.
In recent years, the development of deep learning has made a breakthrough in WFS.103,104
An image-guided WFS method was developed101 [Fig. 3(c)], which iteratively optimizes the
phase of the spatial light modulator with the goal of maximizing the image quality metric
(improved combination of entropy and variance). Diffractive-limited, high-contrast images of
hidden objects from the very low-contrast speckle pattern can be recovered, even with the object
outside the field of view of the memory effect. In addition, introducing neural networks to cal-
culate complex optical aberrations from scattering media is also a promising direction102
[Fig. 3(d)]. Through backpropagation without guide stars, the antiscattering imaging of a wide
field of view of dynamic scenes at diffraction-limited resolution can also be achieved.

3.2 WFS in MMF
Correcting aberrations inside MMF has also been studied via WFS. In general, an MMF has a
diameter of only a few hundred microns but can support tens of thousands of optical modes. This
advantage makes it an ideal device for endoscopic imaging. It also holds great potential to replace
the coarse glass fiber bundles105 currently used for medical purposes. However, due to the mode
coupling, meaning different modes occur in different phase delays, MMF shows the character-
istics of the scattering medium. The light through MMF cannot be directly used to form an image
but produces a disordered speckle. The conversion of MMF to endoscope imaging fiber using
WFS has been widely studied.
For the linear mode coupling process in MMF, the optical input and output can still be
connected by the TM. Therefore, WFS is effective in MMF. In fact, methods, such as OPC,28
TM,106 and iterative optimization,107 have been applied in MMF-based endoscopy imaging,
and in vivo imaging of animal neurons108 and blood cells109 has also been realized. However,
these methods require MMF not to be deformed or bent, which limits applications in medical
diagnosis. A spatial-frequency tracking adaptive beacon light-field-encoded endoscope has

been proposed recently110 [Fig. 4(a)]. The special beacon intensity that reflects the correlation
between the current bending states and the precalibrated TM is detected by the single-pixel
detector. Adaptive tracking is completed by searching the TM that maximizes the intensity
from the premeasured dataset. This method can improve the resolution of endoscopic imaging
to subdiffraction-limited value with high stability and robustness against the movement and
deformation of the fiber. In addition to endoscopic microstructure imaging, MMF has also
been used in recent years for far-field imaging of three-dimensional (3D) real scenes111,112
[Fig. 4(b)]. Using WFS to correct the aberration of MMF, combined with the time-of-flight
method, high-speed 3D imaging can be achieved, benefiting motion detection and tracking for
industrial applications.
However, there are nonlinear effects32 between the speckle output and the input of MMF,
which greatly reduce the effectiveness of the TM based on the linear premise. Deep neural
networks have been shown to be useful for learning nonlinear processes in MMF.104 By train-
ing a conventional convolutional neural network,113 the input image can be recovered from the
speckle without the unstable TM measurement [Fig. 5(a)]. However, the generalization of
the neural network is limited, and it is usually only effective for the images highly similar
to the training data set. Thus the performance is limited for the general purpose of image
transmission. A method to reconstruct the complex inversion matrix of MMF by statistical
means successfully realizes the transmission and imaging of full-color natural images with
high frame rate and high resolution, without data-based learning114 [Fig. 5(b)]. Because this
approach is based on a physically informed model of the imaging system that retrieves an
approximation to TM, its generalization is better than that of the deep neural network
approaches.
The mode coupling of MMF occurs in various degrees of freedom.51 In principle, to
achieve full control of MMF, the modulated light needs to be completely reversed in time.
This means that the modulated light is a volume field that should have arbitrarily specified
amplitude, phase, and polarization at every point in space and time. However, this kind of full
degree of freedom controlled field has been difficult to produce in research.115,116 Recently, a
time-reversal device that can independently and simultaneously measure and control all
classical degrees of freedom has been invented117 (Fig. 6). This method can generate a series
of arbitrary two-dimensional vector fields at a high rate and is used for spatiotemporal control
of light in MMF, including imaging, nonlinear optical phenomena, and micromanipulation.
The modulation of all degrees of freedom could be an important direction of WFS
development.

4 Discussion and Outlook
So far, WFS has shown unique advantages and potential in solving scattering problems. In this
paper, the basic concepts and general methods of WFS, as well as the contributions and develop-
ments in focusing, imaging, and optical fiber endoscopy, are reviewed. It is worth mentioning
that although dealing with scattering in biomedicine is the current focus, the applications of WFS
are not limited to this.118–121 As mentioned in the introduction, in recent years, holographic
display122–124 and optical communication125–127 have also been supported by the rapid develop-
ment of WFS. However, at present, they are still in the experimental verification stage. For exam-
ple, the holographic display using scattering can only generate a simple pattern composed of
focused points, which is far from the commercial 3D digital holographic display.128
A key problem preventing WFS from practical applications is the trade-off between the
speed and the number of modulation modes. The TM of the scattering medium changes with
time, environmental disturbance, or bending deformation.129,130 In general, the decorrelation time
of biological tissue is approximately milliseconds and decreases with the increase of tissue
depth.131 In addition, for MMF, bending is basically unavoidable. Despite a lot of exploration,
such as the development of modulators from liquid crystal modulators to DMDs with refresh
rates of up to kilohertz,24,132 there is still a long way to go to achieve real-time correction of
dynamic scattering. WFS that takes effect within the speckle correlation time will be the key
to determining whether it can be applied.
In addition, the number of input and output optical modes of a scattering medium is huge,
but the modes WFS can control are often limited or even insufficient. On the one hand, the
number of input modes often depends on the number of effective modulation units, which is
much smaller than the theoretical maximum number,37 which limits the performance of

WFS. For example, the enhancement of antiscattering focusing is approximately linear with the
number of modulation modes.66 On the other hand, the number of pixels of the camera is also
limited, and the speckle imaging in the camera is a lowpass filtering process.32 Thus the meas-
urement of all output modes is almost impossible. Currently, people often choose to trade the
number of optical modes for the speed,1 because the increase of modes in most methods puts a
significant burden on speed. WFS outside the speckle correction time window is no longer useful
to correct the scattering.
Apart from the speed and mode numbers, the degree of freedom of control is also a key to
WFS. Multiple scattering not only confuses light into speckles of randomly distributed intensity
but also disturbs the information of almost all degrees of freedom of light.51 The ultimate ideal of
WFS needs to control all the information of the light, including but not limited to spatiotemporal
information in the scattering process, which will truly enable the “transparency” of the scattering
medium. Currently, it is still a challenge to control the complex information of all the degrees
of freedom independently for existing spatial light modulators. With the development of
vector vortex beams,54 spectroscopy,133 and nonlinear optics,134 this challenge can potentially
be overcome.
Data-driven learning-based methods bring new vitality to the development of WFS. Instead
of relying on physical models, such as TM, a deep neural network model is used to learn com-
pensating scattering aberrations from a large training data set and can achieve better performance.
For example, it can learn how to correct dynamic scattering aberrations102 and the deformation of
MMF.114 It can also enlarge the field of view limited by the memory effect, lower the requirement
of scattering calibration, and improve the stability of the system.135 The relevant research is in the
initial stage, and future engineering efforts are still needed.1 For example, training a neural
network requires a large and diverse set of targeted data, resulting in expensive training and
insufficient generalization. Learning-based imaging mostly stays in the two-dimensional plane,
and how to translate it to depth-resolved volume imaging is still challenging. Meanwhile, since
the training process requires direct access to the input and output planes, imaging objects inside
the scattering medium presents another difficulty. Nevertheless, learning-based WFS is becom-
ing the focus of research and is promising to bring about a new technological revolution in
this field.
5 Conclusion
Scattering is a fundamental problem in the field of optics. Overcoming the limitation of scattering
and achieving optical “transparency” in turbid media is always an urgent goal. The rapid devel-
opment of WFS over the past decade has shown that the best solution is not to avoid scattering
but to find ways to correct it or even use it. So far, there are many well-established methods to
compensate scattering to construct a bright focus136,137 or to transmit images.138,139
In this paper, the basic principles, methods of WFS, and the latest applications of WFS in
focusing, imaging, and MMF endoscopy are described. In addition, the present challenges and
outlooks of WFS are discussed. Currently, there are three major aspects for the development of
WFS: faster to adapt to dynamic scattering,140 more modes to meet the needs of actual scenar-
ios,96 and more degrees of freedom to be controlled simultaneously.95 Fortunately, the introduc-
tion of data-driven learning-based methods may open up a new possibility for WFS.141 Although
WFS is still not mature enough for practical applications, the development of this field is very
encouraging. Various exciting results show the great potential that WFS will drive major develop-
ments in biomedicine, imaging, optical communication, and other fields.
