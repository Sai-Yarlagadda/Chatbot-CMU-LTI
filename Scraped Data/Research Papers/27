Abstract: Several immune and immunocompetent cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages,
adipocytes, natural killer cells, T cells, and B cells, are signiﬁcantly correlated with the complex
discipline of oncology. Cytotoxic innate and adaptive immune cells can block tumor proliferation,
and others can prevent the immune system from rejecting malignant cells and provide a favorable
environment for tumor progression. These cells communicate with the microenvironment through
cytokines, a chemical messenger, in an endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine manner. These cytokines
play an important role in health and disease, particularly in host immune responses to infection
and inﬂammation. They include chemokines, interleukins (ILs), adipokines, interferons, colony-
stimulating factors (CSFs), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which are produced by a wide range
of cells, including immune cells, such as macrophages, B-cells, T-cells, and mast cells, as well as
endothelial cells, ﬁbroblasts, a variety of stromal cells, and some cancer cells. Cytokines play a crucial
role in cancer and cancer-related inﬂammation, with direct and indirect effects on tumor antagonistic
or tumor promoting functions. They have been extensively researched as immunostimulatory
mediators to promote the generation, migration and recruitment of immune cells that contribute to an
effective antitumor immune response or pro-tumor microenvironment. Thus, in many cancers such
as breast cancer, cytokines including leptin, IL-1B, IL-6, IL-8, IL-23, IL-17, and IL-10 stimulate while
others including IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-γ, inhibit cancer proliferation and/or invasion and enhance
the body’s anti-tumor defense. Indeed, the multifactorial functions of cytokines in tumorigenesis
will advance our understanding of cytokine crosstalk pathways in the tumor microenvironment,
such as JAK/STAT, PI3K, AKT, Rac, MAPK, NF-κB, JunB, cFos, and mTOR, which are involved
in angiogenesis, cancer proliferation and metastasis. Accordingly, targeting and blocking tumor-
promoting cytokines or activating and amplifying tumor-inhibiting cytokines are considered cancer-
directed therapies. Here, we focus on the role of the inﬂammatory cytokine system in pro- and
anti-tumor immune responses, discuss cytokine pathways involved in immune responses to cancer
and some anti-cancer therapeutic applications.

1. Introduction
Immunology is closely related to the complex discipline of oncology, where the im-
mune response is recognized as a double-edged sword in terms of tumor progression,
either by attenuating or promoting cancer invasiveness and metastasis. There are two
distinct aspects of the immune response: (1) the innate, mediated by non-speciﬁc immunity
cells, such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer
(NK) cells, and γδT lymphocytes [1]; and (2) the adaptive, mediated by speciﬁc immunity

cells, such as T (CD4+ helpers and CD8+ cytotoxic) and B lymphocytes, both working
together to protect against pathogens [2] and abnormal cells. Immunocompetent cells
(cells capable of mediating an effective immune response) include non-speciﬁc and spe-
ciﬁc immunity cells, but also non-immune cells, such as adipocytes. The latter can act as
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) since they can express major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class I and II molecules and present their antigenic determinants to T cells to trigger
an immune response, cytokine production, and subsequent intercellular signaling. In obese
individuals, adipocytes can recruit and activate immune cells, such as adipose-resident T
cells (ARTs) to stimulate the adipose pro-inﬂammatory response during the progression
of obesity [3]. Naïve CD4+ T helper cells (Th) are activated after interaction with the
antigen-MHC complex and differentiated into subsets of helper T cells, such as Th1, Th2,
Th17, and regulatory T cell (Tregs) that produce different combinations of cytokines and
other factors. Tregs are identiﬁed as those suppressing anti-tumor activity by inhibiting,
among others, the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th1, thus enhancing the tumor
development and metastasis [4]. In addition, some immune cells play a dual role, such as
neutrophils (cancer promoting—tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs)/suppressing) [5]
and macrophages, divided into M1-like macrophages (pro-inﬂammatory and anti-cancer
activities), M2-like macrophages (anti-inﬂammatory and pro-cancer activities) and tumor-
associated macrophages (TAMs) [6].
These immune cells send signals to communicate with the microenvironment using
cytokines that act as chemical messengers in an endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine manner
and mediate intercellular communication of the immune system. Cytokines, called im-
munomodulatory agents, are synthesized under physiological and pathological conditions,
and secreted by different cell types, such as immune cells, immunocompetent cells (e.g.,
adipocytes), and some cancer cells. They are involved in cellular (type 1) and antibody-
mediated (type 2) immunity, as anti/pro-inﬂammatory and pro/anti-tumorigenic effectors
depending on the microenvironment. Cytokines can affect the actions of other cells by
binding to their surface receptors and subsequently activating numerous signaling path-
ways. There are different types of cytokines, including chemokines, interleukins, adipokines,
transforming growth factors (TGFs), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), colony-stimulating factors (CSFs)
and interferons (IFN), which can act alone, in synergic, protagonist, or antagonist manner to
regulate inﬂammatory and immune responses [7].
Chemokines are chemoattractant cytokines that give chemical orders to attract inﬂamma-
tory cells, such as leukocytes (monocytes, neutrophils) as well as other cell types, including
endothelial and epithelial cells, to the site of interest [8]. They are classiﬁed as CX3C,
CXC, CC, or C chemokines based on the positioning of conserved cysteine residues [9] and
interact with G protein-linked transmembrane receptors called chemokine receptors [10].
Depending on their function, chemokines can be inﬂammatory (e.g., CXCL8, CCL3), recruit-
ing cells through inﬂammatory stimulus, or/and homeostatic (movement and localization
of cell subsets) [11].
Moreover, interleukins (ILs), low molecular weight cytokines, have both pro- and
anti-inﬂammatory properties. They are secreted by almost all immunocompetent cells,
such as (but not limited to) T cells, granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, adipocytes,
and endothelial cells [12]. They play essential roles in the development, differentiation,
activation, maturation, migration, and adhesion of immune cells [13].
Adipokines, or adipocytokines, are cytokines speciﬁcally secreted by adipose tissue that
is composed mainly of adipocytes, pre-adipocytes, macrophages, stromal cells, ﬁbroblasts,
and endothelial cells [14]. They include adipose tissue-speciﬁc cytokines (adiponectin, lep-
tin), but also other cytokine types, such as interleukins, TNFs, or chemokines. Adipokines
regulate energy expenditure, inﬂammation, appetite control, and fat distribution [15], but
can contribute to an obesity-related low-grade inﬂammation, development of metabolic
diseases [16], and also to cancer progression and metastasis [17]. There are two groups of
adipokines based on their effect on the immune system: pro-inﬂammatory, such as leptin,
TNFα, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8), potentially

linking adiposity and inﬂammation, and anti-inﬂammatory, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10)
and adiponectin [17,18]. Some of the adipokines participate in the anti-cancer activity, such
as adiponectin [18] and some present tumorigenic properties, such as leptin [19].
TGFs are a subgroup of a larger family of protein hormones that are up-regulated in
some human cancers and play several roles in growth and development of non-malignant
and malignant cells. TGFα belongs to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, can
induce epithelial development, cell proliferation, and is involved in tumorigenesis and
angiogenesis [20]. It is secreted by M2 macrophages and various tumor cells, and can
regulate T cells, NK cells, and macrophages in tumor microenvironment (TME), which
contributes to the suppression of anti-tumor immunity and promotes tumor growth [21].
CSF has been implicated, for example, in breast carcinogenesis (varies by menopausal
status) [22]. TNFα is a key cytokine involved in the generation of the proinﬂammatory
response and many different cellular responses, such as the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic
genes, inducing cell survival and proliferation, but also cancer invasion [23]. As an
adipokine, it has an impact on the endocrine functions of adipose tissue and is associ-
ated with obesity, promotes insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
Finally, IFN, named after its ability to interfere with viral growth [24], is released by
host cells and plays a controversial role in immune status modulation, anti-microbial/anti-
viral host defense, up-regulation of antigen presentation and expression of MHC antigens.
Type I IFNs (IFN-α, IFN-β) are produced by ﬁbroblasts and monocytes when the body
recognizes a virus that has invaded it. They stimulate the expression of proteins that
will prevent the virus from producing and replicating its RNA and/or DNA. Type II IFN
(IFN-γ) is released by CD8+ T and Th1 cells, activating cells, such as NK cells, M1-type
macrophages and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, increasing MHC I and II presentation, thus
enhancing anti-tumor immunity [25].
So, cytokines affect the growth and function of many cell types and can activate or
modulate speciﬁc or non-speciﬁc anti-tumor responses. In breast cancer, cancer cells are
directly in contact with the adipose microenvironment and reciprocal interactions with
immunocompetent cells, immune cells, inﬁltrating immune cells (TANs, M2, TAMs) [6],
ﬁbroblasts, cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (CAFs) [26], and endothelial cells, have been re-
vealed, particularly in obese people [27]. The TME could play a critical role in all stages
of tumor development, contributing to the development, progression, and metastasis of
malignant cells. Some cytokines (leptin, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-23, IL-17, TGF-β, IL-10) are
mostly reported to stimulate while others (Il-2, IL-12, IFNs) inhibit breast cancer prolifera-
tion and/or invasion. The former contribute to the establishment of a tumor-promoting
inﬂammation, recognized as a hallmark of cancer [28]. There are two types of inﬂammation,
acute inﬂammation induced by common bacterial infections and viruses, and chronic
inﬂammation associated with chronic disease, obesity [29], and cancer [30]. To some extent,
inﬂammatory environment and chronic inﬂammation have long been associated with
increased incidence of malignancy and tumor-promoting effect [31,32] through bioactive
molecules. Therefore, using various agents to activate or boost the immune system and
attack cancer cells by natural mechanisms through immunotherapy is becoming a powerful
clinical strategy to treat cancer [33]. To this end, it is extremely relevant to understand the
regulatory mechanisms of inﬂammation in breast carcinogenesis and metastatic progression
to enable identiﬁcation of novel therapeutic targets for tumors [28].
In this review, we are discussing the relationship between cytokines recognized as
having an important role in TME in breast cancer, such as adipokines and some other
cytokines, and how they regulate cancer immunity. It provides a comprehensive overview
of cytokine crosstalk, their biological roles, the signaling pathways and transcription factors
responsible for the anti- or pro-tumor response and suggested immunotherapeutic strategy
for each cytokine for effective treatment of cancer. The details of cytokine overview are
described in Table 1.

2. Leptin
Leptin is an obesity-associated adipokine known as the “obesity hormone”, whose
circulating levels increase proportionally to body fat mass [193]. It is a pleiotropic cytokine
of the IL-6 family produced and expressed mainly by adipose tissue [194], enterocytes [195],
but also by immune cells, endothelial cells [196], ﬁbroblasts, CAFs [197], and some tumor
tissues. It is encoded by the obese (Ob) gene which maintains energy homeostasis, through
a central feedback mechanism at the hypothalamus. Under normal physiological conditions,
leptin plays a key role in the long-term regulation of energy balance by reducing appetite
and increasing the metabolism, thereby controlling food intake and body weight [36,37]. In
obese individuals with insulin resistance, high levels of leptin have been correlated with
the amount of fat in the body, acting as a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine and amplifying the
insulin resistance process [40,198,199].
Leptin promotes cell proliferation and the development of breast cancers [200] and
may be a potential biomarker of breast cancer risk in women, especially overweight/obese
or postmenopausal women [201]. Women with elevated serum leptin have a higher risk of
breast cancer [202]. Higher levels of leptin have been observed in the invasive stage, from
mammary ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive ductal carcinoma [27], in the cytosol and
nuclei of metastatic cells [203,204].
In addition, leptin promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [39] by up-
regulating the expression of CSC/EMT-related genes [205], tumor evasion, cell migra-
tion [206,207], tumor size, overexpression of estrogen and progesterone receptors [208],
protection of malignant cells from apoptosis [38], and breast cancer metastasis [209]. The
functions of leptin are enhanced by the cross-talk with multiple cytokines. Indeed, it
is an important mediator of interactions between breast cancer cells and TAMs [38] by
stimulating the production of IL-8 which is directly involved in tumor growth [210,211].
The molecular actions of leptin are mediated by ObR (leptin receptor), a large mem-
brane protein member of the class I cytokine receptors [212]. Following leptin binding
to its receptor (Lep/ObR), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) becomes activated through autophos-
phorylation, which in turn phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain
of the receptor for the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). STAT3
forms dimers and translocates into the nucleus where it activates the transcription of dif-
ferent target genes involved in cellular activation, proliferation, and differentiation [213].
Phosphorylated JAK2 also activates other pathways, including mitogen-activated-protein
kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) promoting cell proliferation
and differentiation [214,215] and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B
(Akt)/Rac that mediates the regulation of cell cycle, growth, proliferation, and energy
metabolism [34,35,216]. It also activates the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and
NF-κB to regulate the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and then promotes an-
giogenesis in mammary tumors [35]. In addition, it activates reactive oxygen species
(ROS) production in human epithelial mammary cells [217], and can regulate metabolic
reprogramming to promote cellular growth [218] (Figures 1 and 2).

Leptin-targeting drugs can affect different cell types, including endothelial cells, 
adipocytes [219], cancer cells with a less aggressive phenotype, and immune cells by 
decreasing macrophage recruitment, phagocytic activity, and cytokine production [209]. 
Thus, the use of antibodies targeting leptin/Ob-R able to perform an antagonist activity 
could be used in breast cancer therapy. For example, researchers blocked leptin signaling 
by a leptin peptide receptor antagonist that simultaneously decreased VEGF/VEGFR2 and 
IL-1 levels [220], or by producing a synthetic farnesoid X receptor (FXR) (regulator of the 
dialogue between breast cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts) agonist GW4064, 
which affects the tumor-promoting activities of CAFs in breast malignancy [221]. Some new 
super active leptin antagonists (D23L/L39A/D40A/F41A) exhibited more than 60-fold 
binding to the leptin receptor [222]. In breast cancer, a leptin antagonist-honokiol, a bioactive 
polyphenol from Magnolia grandiflora, is reported to activate the liver kinase B1-miR-34a axis 
and finally inhibit EMT [223]. 
3. TNFα 
TNFα is a major inflammatory cytokine and adipokine described as a circulating and 
endotoxin-induced factor of hemorrhagic tumor necrosis when present in high 
concentrations. It is mainly produced by macrophages and in a lower extent by B and T 
(cytotoxic CD8+ and CD4+ Th1) cells, NK cells, mast cells, fibroblasts, osteoclasts, endothelial, 
and muscle cells. It can act both in autocrine and paracrine signaling [224]. In general, as an 
adipokine, it is associated with obesity, promotes insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. By 
regulating many cellular and biological processes, it may also have an impact on the 
endocrine functions of adipose tissue. It can reduce adiponectin secretion, inhibit 
carbohydrate metabolism, lipogenesis and adipogenesis, and stimulate lipolysis [225]. As a 
cytokine, it is released by macrophages to alert other cells of the immune system as part of 
an inflammatory response [226]. Thus, it is involved in the generation of a pro-inflammatory 
response, as it can activate and up-regulate more than 400 inflammatory genes and 
stimulate many different cellular responses, such as transcription of pro-inflammatory 
genes of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [48,49].

tive polyphenol from Magnolia grandiﬂora, is reported to activate the liver kinase B1-miR-34a
axis and ﬁnally inhibit EMT [223].
3. TNFα
TNFα is a major inﬂammatory cytokine and adipokine described as a circulating and
endotoxin-induced factor of hemorrhagic tumor necrosis when present in high concentra-
tions. It is mainly produced by macrophages and in a lower extent by B and T (cytotoxic
CD8+ and CD4+ Th1) cells, NK cells, mast cells, ﬁbroblasts, osteoclasts, endothelial, and
muscle cells. It can act both in autocrine and paracrine signaling [224]. In general, as an
adipokine, it is associated with obesity, promotes insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
By regulating many cellular and biological processes, it may also have an impact on the
endocrine functions of adipose tissue. It can reduce adiponectin secretion, inhibit carbo-
hydrate metabolism, lipogenesis and adipogenesis, and stimulate lipolysis [225]. As a
cytokine, it is released by macrophages to alert other cells of the immune system as part of
an inﬂammatory response [226]. Thus, it is involved in the generation of a pro-inﬂammatory
response, as it can activate and up-regulate more than 400 inﬂammatory genes and stimu-
late many different cellular responses, such as transcription of pro-inﬂammatory genes of
inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines [48,49].
TNFα has a key role in breast cancer. It is involved in breast cancer cell survival and/or
proliferation [52], tumor-promoting, aggressiveness [53], tumor-promoting macrophage
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4002
12 of 40
inﬁltration, CAF phenotype, inﬂammatory chemokine expression, such as C-X-C motif
ligand 8 (CXCL8 = IL-8), and angiogenesis [50]. The prometastatic role of TNFα and its
involvement in the EMT process required tumor cell migration to establish breast cancer
metastasis [41] and its over-expression has often been associated with aggressive cancer
behavior and poor prognosis [227]. TNFα and IL-1β are the essential pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines often found in TME. In breast cancer, inﬂammation is known to be associated
with poor prognosis and higher risk of recurrence in patients [228]. TNF-α production
by peripheral blood T cells in patients with inﬂammatory breast cancer was positively
correlated with the detection of circulating tumor cells expressing EMT markers [229].
TNFα is recognized by a variety of stromal cells, mainly by TAMs, adipocytes, epithelial
and malignant cancer cells themselves [41–44]. In addition, TNFα and IL-6 have been
positively correlated with aromatase activity in human breast adipose tissue in primary
culture by increasing aromatase mRNA [230].
Ultimately, TNFα binds to two different receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, and is capa-
ble of activating NF-κB, c-Jun, activating protein-1 (AP1), MAPKs, Akt, TAZ, and c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK)/P38 [45–47]. TAZ is a transcriptional coactivator, activated via
NF-κB to induce tumor initiation and self-renewal in breast cancer stem-like cells, a sub-
population of primary breast tumor cells with differentiation and self-renewal capacities
implicated in tumor generation, cancer relapse, and metastasis [231]. TNFα expression
is transcriptionally induced by NF-κB, c-Jun, AP1, and nuclear factor associated with
activated T cells (NFAT). Ligand-occupied TNFR1 induces NF-κB and c-Jun activations,
which inhibit apoptosis, increase transcription of survival factors (Bcl-2), transcription of
pro-inﬂammatory genes, cell death pathways through apoptosis (apoptosis signaling kinase
1 ASK1) or necroptosis [232], promote transcription of EMT-related factors (i.e., matrix
metallopeptidase-2 [MMP2], MMP9), and decrease E-cadherin transcription. However,
TNFR2 can activate NF-κB through a pathway similar to that of TNFR1, but it can also
activate endothelial/epithelial tyrosine kinase phosphorylation that can activate the Akt
pathway. In particular, prolonged exposure of breast cancer cell lines to TNFα induces EMT
through the activation of IKKβ and NF-κB [233], cancer cell migration via the MAPK/ERK
signaling pathway [234], and MMP2 and MMP9 expression [235,236]. TNFα has been
shown to induce the gene expression of aromatase in undifferentiated adipose ﬁbroblasts
via c-Fos and c-Jun, and inhibits adipogenic differentiation in breast TME [237]. However,
IL-10, through inhibition of TNFα induction, can suppress aromatase mRNA expression in
human adipose tissue [238] (Figures 1 and 2).
TNFα can induce resistance to breast cancer therapies, such as ionizing radiation
therapy [239] and chemotherapy [240]. In breast cancer, TNFα inhibition has been shown
to increase the sensitivity to doxorubicin [241]. TNFα mediates TNFR1-dependent IL-17
production by CD4+ T cells [53] and can promote the activities of immune and cancer cells
within tumors. Targeting TNFR2 with antagonistic antibodies (anti-PD-1) has been shown to
inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and tumor-associated Tregs [242]. Therefore, blocking
TNFα or its receptors may have signiﬁcant anti-tumor effects [31,243,244] and inhibition of
TNFα on tumorigenesis can be positive depending on the immune microenvironment and
TNFα concentration.
4. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β)
IL-1β, known as an endogenous mediator of leukocytes, is a potent pro-inﬂammatory
cytokine involved in the modulation of autoimmune inﬂammation [245], proinﬂamma-
tory response, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. IL1-β gene transcription in
macrophages is mainly induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) via toll-like receptors (TLRs)
or IL-1β itself and by TNFα via the TNF receptors, which are capable of activating NF-κB
and subsequently STAT1 pathway [246]. This cytokine is primarily produced by activated
macrophages as a proprotein called pro-IL-1β, an inactive precursor. It is proteolytically pro-
cessed to its active form IL-1β by inﬂammatory caspase 1 cleavage (CASP1/ICE) [247] and
subsequently binds to IL-1 receptor CD121a/IL1R1 and CD121b/IL1R2 subunits [248,249].
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4002
13 of 40
It can also be produced and secreted by a variety of cell types, such as adipocytes, mono-
cytes, DCs, ﬁbroblasts, B cells, TAMs [54,55], and some cancer cells to enhance tumor-
promotion [54,56].
In the TME, IL-1β is up-regulated in many solid tumors, including breast cancers [54].
IL-1β has been reported to control tumor invasion, up-regulate the initiation and develop-
ment of primary tumor, increase the aggressivity of luminal breast cancer cells, and increase
IL-6 production through NF-κB pathway [250] leading to tumor growth and aggressiveness.
IL-1β has been linked with poor prognosis in breast cancer [251] and plays a critical role in
the recruitment and maturation of adaptive T cell-mediated immunity including CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells [252] and myeloid cells [68]. IL-1β also activates focal adhesion kinase and
Src to induce MMP9 production and invasion of MCF-7 breast cancer cells [253]. In vitro
studies have recently shown that primary breast cancer cells cocultured with monocytes
exhibit increased IL-1β, IL-8, and MMPs [254], suggesting that inﬂammation and subse-
quent recruitment of immune cells promote breast cancer development at early stages.
Furthermore, in a spontaneous in vivo model of breast cancer, cancer cells stimulate sys-
temic inﬂammation by producing IL-1β, which leads to stimulation of IL-17 production
by γδT cells [57] and can inhibit anti-tumor CD8+ T cell activity [57]. TAM-derived IL-1β
can increase cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in breast cancer cells and contribute to
cancer progression [60,61], migration/invasion [65], regulate metastatic process [255], and
EMT [66].
M2-type macrophages, TAMs and cancer cells can stimulate IL-1β production [256]
and subsequently, IL-1β increases macrophage recruitment through the expression of
monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, which can be polarized into TAM and pro-
mote cancer, tumor growth, and metastasis [257]. M1-type macrophages are the cells
most frequently induced to produce IL-1β, and subsequently stimulate proinﬂamma-
tory mediators [258], the production of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), and VEGF-A in
adipocytes [259], MMP9 [59], and matrix-remodeling activities [69,70]. In this context,
obesity induces secretion of MCP1 and IL-1β by adipocytes associated with breast tissue,
which increases macrophage recruitment and the formation of crown-like structures (CLS),
followed by the secretion of CXCL12, a key effector responsible for stromal vasculariza-
tion and angiogenesis [260]. In addition, it promotes activation of PI3K/Rac 1-regulated,
ERK1/2 and AP-1, and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in invasive cancer
cells [58] (Figures 1 and 2).
Overall, IL-1β represents a major upstream cytokine. Inhibition of IL-1β signaling
in malignant tumors are now considered as potential targets for cancer therapy. Anti-IL-
1β therapy is shown to decrease metastasis [66], invasiveness, inﬂammation-mediated
immunosuppression concomitantly with increased anti-tumor immunity response [261].
In breast cancer, a variety of drugs are currently used in clinical practice to target the IL-1
signaling pathway, including anakinra (Nbib1802970), the standard of care used for phase I
metastatic breast cancer, and PDR001 (Nbib2900664), in combination with CJM112, EGF816,
Ilaris (canakinumab), or Mekinist (trametinib) used for triple-negative phase I and phase II
breast cancer [262].
5. Interleukin-6 (IL-6)
IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine and an adipokine that clearly has both tumor-
promoting and pro-inﬂammatory effects [75,76]. It was originally identiﬁed as B cell
stimulating factor-2 (BSF-2) and the inducer of immunoglobulin production [263].
IL-6 is produced by non-malignant cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, T cells, B
cells, ﬁbroblasts, endothelial cells, and adipocytes [75–77]. IL-6 transcription is induced
by various stimuli, such as TNFα and ROS [264,265]. It promotes Th2 differentiation and
simultaneously inhibits Th1 polarization, maintains dynamic balance between Th1 and
Th2 immune cells [266], and regulates the balance between IL-17-producing Th17 cells
and Treg [267]. In the TME, its main sources are some cancer cells [78,79], TAMs [71],
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), Th2 cells, and CAFs [73,74].
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4002
14 of 40
IL-6 is a major player in chronic inﬂammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer,
and tumor immunity [268,269]. In breast cancer, IL-6 is found to be overexpressed [270]
and has been described as a tumor-promoting cytokine through its major effector STAT3. It
is a key factor in malignancy by promoting cell growth (via the suppression of apoptosis
and promotion of angiogenesis [271]), macrophage polarization [72], tumor initiation,
progression, and metastasis [31,268,272], by selectively recruiting mesenchymal stem cells
to sites of carcinoma growth where they interact with breast cancer stem cells [273]. IL-6
controls cancer stem cell renewal and induces cancer cell migration [274], and EMT [275]. IL-
6 stimulates aromatase and therefore estrogen biosynthesis, thus contributing to hormone-
dependent breast cancer [276]. CAFs in breast tumors express high levels of IL-6 and
subsequently mediate epithelial-stromal interactions to promote tumorigenesis [277]. High
IL-6 levels in breast cancer tissues maintain the aggressive phenotype [278].
The IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) is a hetero-trimeric complex receptor composed of an IL-
6-binding receptor molecule α-subunit (gp80) and two signal transducing β-subunits of
glycoprotein 130 (gp130) [264]. Classical IL-6 signaling is initiated by its binding to IL-6Rα
(present either on the cell surface or in secreted form, which then induces cis dimerization
of gp130, auto- and trans-phosphorylation and activation of the associated JAK1, JAK2,
and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) [81]. The tyrosine residues phosphorylated by JAKs in the
intracellular domain of gp130 activate the transcription factors STAT3/STAT1 [82,83], Src
homology 2 (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), ERK, MAPK, and
PI3K signaling pathways [84,85]. Thus, STAT3 may mediate tumorigenesis by increasing
cell-cycle progression [87], resistance to apoptosis (inducing the expression of BCL2, BCL-
XL, and survivin) [279,280], metastasis [89], and senescence [86]. In addition, IL-6/STAT3
signaling activates the transcription of target genes, including the proto-oncogenes c-myc,
JunB, cFos, and mTORC1 metabolic regulators [279,281–285]. It also blocks DC differen-
tiation, thereby preventing T cell activation and inducing T cell death [91]. Activation of
STAT3 in tumor-associated endothelial cells, TAMs, and cancer cells, induces their ability to
express basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF) and VEGF, promoting rapid vascularization.
Indeed, IL-6 may up-regulate circulating VEGF in breast cancer patients and promote
angiogenesis and metastasis [286]. IL-6 may promote the mobilization of anti-tumor CD8+
effector T cell responses, the development of APC, such as DCs and cytotoxic T cells [91,93],
as well as the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and recruitment of leukocytes [94,95].
Activation of IL-6Rα expressed on DCs can act directly on CD4+ T cells through gp130 and
subsequently induce Th17 cells [92]. Furthermore, it has been shown that high expression
of IL-6Rα induces resistance to apoptosis in breast cancer [287] (Figures 1 and 2).
Therefore, blocking IL-6 (i.e., anti-IL-6 therapy), targeting its receptor in combination
with signaling from other anticancer therapies, and targeting the IL-6-STAT3 axis is a poten-
tial therapeutic strategy that may be beneﬁcial in the treatment of breast cancer [206,288,289].
Down-regulation of IL-6 is linked to a better response to breast cancer treatment [290] and
a recent study showed that the IL-6R neutralizing antibody, tocilizumab, abrogated IL-6
signaling in breast cancer [291]. A synthetic anti-gp130 compound (bazedoxifene) inhibited
IL-6-induced growth of breast cancer cell lines and down-regulated STAT3 phosphoryla-
tion [292]. An IL-6R antagonist (Tocilizumab) for trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive
metastatic breast cancer is being evaluated in a clinical trial (NCT03135171) [293].
6. Interleukin-8 (IL-8)
IL-8, also known as CXCL8 [294], is a proinﬂammatory chemokine, produced and ex-
pressed by monocytes [98], macrophages [96], neutrophils [103,104], T cells, ﬁbroblasts [99],
epithelial cells [100], and vascular endothelial cells [101]. It is known as neutrophil chemo-
tactic factor inducing neutrophil and granulocytes recruitment, degranulation [295], and
phagocytosis [296]. IL-8 has been associated with proinﬂammatory response in obesity [297]
and cancer [298] and can induce the recruitment of inﬂammatory cells and oxidative stress
mediators into localized inﬂammation to exert cytotoxic activities [120].
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4002
15 of 40
IL-8 secretion by TAMs [97], CAFs [102], and some cancer cells [105] promotes their re-
cruitment, proliferation, and survival, suppresses CD8+ T cell activity [119], and stimulates
cellular secretion of additional growth factors that contribute to breast cancer progression.
Several studies have shown that in breast cancer cell lines, invasion is directly proportional
to IL-8 expression [299] where, various cytokines, such as IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6, as well as
hormones, such as progesterone and estrogen, are thought to up-regulate IL-8 expression in
breast cancer cells compared to normal breast tissue [300]. Breast cancer cells are reported
to secrete IL-8, express CXCR1/2, and promote breast cancer initiation and progression, as
well as tumor cell migration and invasion [301].
Cellular responses to IL-8 are mediated by two cell-surface G protein-coupled serpen-
tine receptors for a group of C-X-C chemokines, termed CXCR1 and CXCR2 [302]. CXCR1
is speciﬁc for IL-8, whereas CXCR2 can mediate cellular responses [303] after binding other
chemokines as well, such as IL-2 and IL-6. IL-8 expression can be regulated by a variety
of stimuli, including inﬂammatory signals (e.g., TNFα, IL-1β) [99,100], environmental
and chemical stresses (e.g., hypoxia or exposure to chemotherapy agents), and steroid
hormones [304]
IL-8 signaling can activate and regulate PI3K (in neutrophils) [106], PKB/Akt [106],
MAPK (cell proliferation in neutrophils [103,104], endothelial [305], and in some breast can-
cer cell lines) and the Raf-1/MAP/ERK1 cascade, p38 MAPK signaling cascade [107] and
phospholipase C [306,307]. In addition, it can activate Src, focal adhesion kinase FAK [109],
STAT3 [97,110], JAK2/STAT3/Snail (in cancer cells) [96], signaling kinases correlated with
cancer progression. Thus, it forms an immunosuppressive microenvironment to enhance
tumorigenicity, cancer cell motility (via MMP9 expression [308], PI3K-Akt signaling, and
E-cadherin down-regulation) [309], EMT [118,310], invasion and metastasis [115]. In ad-
dition, it can activate endothelial cells in the tumor to promote vascular endothelial cell
proliferation [311] and angiogenesis [312–314]. IL-8 receptors on endothelial cells can
activate Ras/PI3K [111,112], NF-κB/VEGF activation [113], chemoresistance [101], and
metastasis [315] (Figures 1 and 2).
The multiple effects of IL-8 signaling on different cell types present in the TME suggest
that targeting CXC chemokine signaling (including, but not limited to IL-8) may have
important implications for halting disease progression and helping to sensitize tumors to
chemotherapeutic and biologic agents [108]. Furthermore, a clinical study has shown that
elevated serum IL-8 levels correlate with higher-stage breast tumors [316], invasiveness
and poor prognosis [299,317]. CXCL8-CXCR1/2, as a key driver of immune suppression,
may interfere with the differentiation and function of stromal and immune cells in the TME,
ultimately affecting immunotherapy [318,319]. Therefore, blocking the CXCL8-CXCR1/2
axis by using small molecules or antibodies were testes, such as SB225002 (CXCL8 inhibitor
binding to CXCR2) [320] to inhibit tumor progression in HER2+ breast cancer [321], and
danirixin (GSK1325756) to suppress cancer migration, invasion, and metastasis. Finally,
various orally active small-molecule non-competitive antagonists of CXCR1 and CXCR2,
such as SCH527123 (Merck) [322], repertaxin (Dompé, Milan, Italy), and SCH479833 (Merck,
Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA), have demonstrated anti-tumor effects in breast cancer
xenograft models [323].
7. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A)
IL-17A is the founding member of the IL-17 family of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
associated with allergic responses [324]. In humans, increased IL-17A level is associated
with infections, antimicrobial immunity, chronic inﬂammatory diseases, obesity, and au-
toimmune diseases [325,326]. Following stimulation of CD4+ T cells by cytokines, such
as IL-6, TNFα, IL-21, IL-23, TGF-β, and IL-1β, a naïve CD4+ T cell differentiates into an
inﬂammatory class of Th17 cells [130,131] and secretes IL-17A. It is primarily produced by
a group of Th cells known as Th17 cells [132], in response to their stimulation by IL-23 [327].
It is also produced by other cells, such as CD8+ T cells, γδ T cells, NKT, and NK cells [328].
Both STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways are required for this cytokine-mediated IL-17
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4002
16 of 40
production [130,329]. Additionally, the RAR-related orphan nuclear receptor-γt (RORγt) is
the most speciﬁc transcription factor promoting Th17 cell differentiation [330]. The most
notable role of IL-17 is its involvement in the induction and mediation of proinﬂamma-
tory responses under inﬂammatory conditions through the stimulation of many cell types
(macrophages, ﬁbroblasts, endothelial cells) to produce other cytokines, such as TNFα,
IL-1β, IL-6, CSF, TGF-β, and chemokines, including IL-8 to amplify the inﬂammatory
response [326,331,332].
Biologically active IL-17A interacts with the type I single-pass transmembrane protein,
IL-17R cell surface receptor. It can be expressed by T cells [333], macrophages, ﬁbroblasts,
endothelial, epithelial, and cancer cells. Following binding to its receptor, IL-17 activates
several signaling cascades that, in turn, lead to the induction of chemokines and the
recruitment of immune cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes to the site of inﬂammation.
It stabilizes RORγt important pathways that have become a focus around the IL-17 cytokine
family, including NF-κB [334], and the production of IL-6 and TGFβ, and IL-1β signaling
pathways that induce the expression of several proinﬂammatory cytokines.
High levels of IL-17A in the breast microenvironment are associated with the highly
invasive and aggressive phenotype of breast cancer. IL-17A induces activation of ERK1/2
phosphorylation, p38 MAPK and STAT3 (IL-6-STAT3) signaling pathways, and promotes
tumor growth [133], tissue invasion, tissue-remodeling and matrix degrading substances
(such as MMPs, including MMP2 and MMP9) [335], migration [134], inhibition of apoptosis,
and angiogenesis [336] (via activation of VEGF and CXCL8 expression [57]). IL-17A can
stimulate breast tumorigenesis and, in turn, CAFs, γδT and breast tumor cells increase
Th17 cell recruitment and IL-17A production [337]. Tumor-derived IL1β activates γδ T
to produce high levels of IL-17, which leads to neutrophil expansion and altered neu-
trophil phenotype. Neutrophils produce inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which
inhibits the activity of anti-tumor CD8+ T-cells and subsequently stimulates cancer pro-
gression [338], migration, invasion, and metastasis [339]. Interestingly, IL-17 increases
expression of MMP-9, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, COX-2, and MMP-13. furthermore,
IL-17 up-regulates the gene expression corresponding to M2-type TAMs. IL-17 acts alone or
in synergy with other stimuli (such as TNFα and IFN-γ) to activate the expression of many
genes, including cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-19, IL-20, IL-24, TNFα, and granulocyte-CSF,
chemokines, such as IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, C-C motif ligand
2 (CCL2), CCL7, and CCL20 [326,332,340,341], MMP13, receptor activator of nuclear factor
kappa-B ligand (RANKL), and antimicrobial peptides (lipocalin 2, β-defensin-2, S100A7,
and S100A8/9) [326] (Figures 1 and 2).
A better understanding of the character of Th17 cells in tumor immunity should gen-
erate opportunities for the progression of new therapeutic approaches for cancer patients.
Therefore, different strategies should be used depending on the type of cancer and the
clinical inﬂuence of IL-17 in tumor development. For example, the use of neutralizing
antibodies against Th17-related cytokines has been shown to decrease EMT and signiﬁ-
cantly inhibit progression and metastasis of lung cancer [342] and control invasive breast
tumors [343]. Similarly, because the absence of γδ T cells or neutrophils profoundly reduces
metastasis without inﬂuencing primary tumor progression, regulation of the Treg/Th17
axis, inhibition of the γδ/IL-17/neutrophil axis, and blockade of IL-17RB in cancer cells
could be an effective therapeutic approach in breast cancer [57,344].
8. Interleukin-23 (IL-23)
IL-23 is a heterodimeric proinﬂammatory cytokine that belongs to the IL-12 cytokine
family. These two share a common p40 subunit that is covalently linked either to p35
subunit to form IL-12 or to p19 subunit to form IL-23 [345]. It is a key cytokine for the dif-
ferentiation, maintenance, and expansion of Th17 cell, as discussed earlier [345,346]. IL-23
is mainly produced by DCs and macrophages, but also by monocytes, neutrophils, innate
lymphoid cells [121–123], γδ T cells, B cells, and M2/TAM cells [347]. The heterodimeric
IL-23 cytokine receptor is composed of IL12Rβ1 (receptor for IL-12) that signals through
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4002
17 of 40
tyrosine kinase-2 (TYK2), and IL-23R that signals through JAK2 to activate STAT3 [124,125].
IL-23 receptors can be expressed in T cells, NK cells, NKT cells, tumor cells and are weakly
expressed on monocytes, macrophages, and DC populations [124].
Within the immune and inﬂammatory microenvironment, IL-23 participates in the
progression of chronic inﬂammation and its maintenance and plays a critical role in autoim-
mune diseases (via IL-23/IL-17 immune axis) [123,348,349]. Notably, it can manipulate host
immune responses and modulate TME cells. IL-23 is a key cytokine for the differentiation,
maintenance, and expansion of Th17 cells via activation of STAT3, which in turn stabilizes
RORγt, as previously detailed.
It has been identiﬁed as a link between tumor-associated inﬂammation and tumor
immune evasion [129], and can directly affect a variety of premalignant and malignant
tumors. IL-23 is involved in breast carcinoma cell metastasis [349] and is associated with
higher breast cancer tumor size and stages [350]. The pro-tumorigenic role of IL-23 was
ﬁrst reported by Langowski et al., where its genetic blockade resulted in increased cytotoxic
T cell tumor inﬁltration [129]. It has been shown to activate the NF-κB signaling and
then induces immune cell activation which exacerbates inﬂammation and promotes tumor
growth. IL-23 decreases inﬁltration of Treg and CD8+ T cells [126] to promote the inﬁltration
of M2-type macrophages and neutrophil cells and their overexpression and secretion of pro-
tumor immunosuppressive cytokines [126], such as TGF-β and IL-10. Furthermore, IL-23
increases the expression of endothelial and angiogenic markers, such as VEGF [129,351],
MMP9, CD31, and the proliferative marker Ki67 in tumors [126,352]. In turn, mammary
tumor cells produce IL-6, VEGF, CCL22 to recruit TAMs, which stimulate IL-23 production
and maintain the suppressive activity of Treg in the TME [353] (Figures 1 and 2).
In conclusion, IL-23 has been shown to play multifunctional roles in tumorigenesis
by inhibiting anti-tumor effector immunity. It provides an important molecular link be-
tween the tumor-promoting inﬂammatory response and the failure of adaptive immune
surveillance to inﬁltrate tumors [354]. Therefore, injectable IL-23 inhibitor drugs, such as
guselkumab/Tremfya, risankizumab-rzaa/Skyrizi and tildrakizumab-asmn/Ilumya [355],
blocking-up the process of IL-23 (M2 and neutrophils), neutralizing antibodies speciﬁc to
IL-23p19 (G23-8 antibody can down-modulate MMP9 expression and increased surveil-
lance of CD8+ T cells), and IL-23p19 antagonists can provide effective anti-tumor ther-
apy [126,129,356,357].
9. Interleukin-12 (IL-12)
IL-12 is a member of a small family of heterodimeric pro-inﬂammatory cytokines [345],
produced and expressed primarily by APCs, such as DCs and activated macrophages,
depending on the immune context [356,358]. Despite its similarities to IL-23, IL-12 may be
able to stimulate effector cells of innate and adaptive immunity, activate macrophage polar-
ization to M1 type, and enhance anti-tumor cytotoxic immune responses in the TME [135].
The IL-12 receptor comprises IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2 subunits and is commonly expressed
in T cells, NK cells, NKT cells, monocytes, macrophages, and DC populations [124].
Following binding of IL-12 to its receptor expressed on target cells, phosphorylation
and homo-dimerization of STAT4 are promoted by JAK2 and TYK2 [135]. Therefore,
activated STAT4 in CD4+ T cells induces transcription of the transcription factor T-box
(T-bet) that can control IFN-γ production by Th1 cells [359], whereas in combination
with STAT4, it enhances transcription of IL-12Rβ1, regulates Th1 cell differentiation and
promotes expression and activation of Th1-associated receptors [360,361].
IL-12-mediated Th1 activation releases Th1-speciﬁc cytokines, including IFN-γ, to
solicit and recruit cytotoxic NK and CD8+ T cells. IL-12 promotes the differentiation of
naïve CD8+ T cells to the effector phenotype and acts as a CD8+ T-anti-apoptotic factor
that can directly destroy microorganisms and cancer cells through the release of perforin
and proteolytic enzymes [362,363]. Overall, IL-12 targets and modulates Th1, CD8+ T, NK,
and APC cells that regulate immune surveillance, effective antimicrobial and cytotoxic
activity [360,364]. Thus, it promotes efﬁcient anti-tumor responses [360,365], cancer cell

elimination, and tumor clearance in many cancers, such as breast cancer [366], through
inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, T-bet and STAT4
down-regulate RORγt, which limits the generation and proliferation of Th17 and Treg
within the tumor [367,368]. Furthermore, it up-regulates MHCI on tumor cells to facili-
tate self-antigen presentation, increases the production of chemokines, such as CXCL9,
CXCL10, CXCL11, and IFN-γ to attract effector immune cells, such as CD8+ T, NKs, and M1
macrophages [369,369]. In addition, IL-12 can increase the inﬁltration of IFN-γ-producing
NK cells where, mechanistically, activation of IFN-γ signaling inhibits the proliferation of
Tregs and subsequently converts them into IFN-γ-producing T cells [370]. Thus, it enhances
the body’s immune response against cancer [371], promotes cancer cell apoptosis, increases
MHCI expression on APCs, and down-regulates intratumor VEGF [372] (Figures 1 and 3).

directly destroy microorganisms and cancer cells through the release of perforin and 
proteolytic enzymes [362,363]. Overall, IL-12 targets and modulates Th1, CD8+ T, NK, and 
APC cells that regulate immune surveillance, effective antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity 
[360,364]. Thus, it promotes efficient anti-tumor responses [360,365], cancer cell elimination, 
and tumor clearance in many cancers, such as breast cancer [366], through inhibition of the 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, T-bet and STAT4 down-regulate RORγt, 
which limits the generation and proliferation of Th17 and Treg within the tumor [367,368]. 
Furthermore, it up-regulates MHCI on tumor cells to facilitate self-antigen presentation, 
increases the production of chemokines, such as CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and IFN-γ to 
attract effector immune cells, such as CD8+ T, NKs, and M1 macrophages [369,369]. In 
addition, IL-12 can increase the infiltration of IFN-γ-producing NK cells where, 
mechanistically, activation of IFN-γ signaling inhibits the proliferation of Tregs and 
subsequently converts them into IFN-γ-producing T cells [370]. Thus, it enhances the body’s 
immune response against cancer [371], promotes cancer cell apoptosis, increases MHCI 
expression on APCs, and down-regulates intratumor VEGF [372] (Figures 1 and 3).

Therefore, IL-12 can be considered a strong candidate for immunotherapy-based 
interventions. It may be beneficial in controlling tumor growth by activating effective anti-
tumor cytotoxic immune responses and killing tumor cells by tumor-specific cytotoxic NK 
and CD8+ T cells [373,374]. Recombinant human IL-12 (rhIL-12) is currently in clinical trials 
for the treatment of cancer and may also play a beneficial role in synergy with chemotherapy 
(through activation of NK cells) and radiation therapy (reducing complications) 
[356,375,376]. Various therapies have been devised. For advanced solid tumors, such as 
breast, a mRNA-based IL-12 delivery (SAR441000), an mRNA mixture encoding IL-12sc, 
interferon alpha2b, GM-CSF, and IL-15sushi/ is being evaluated [374]. 
10. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) 
IL-2 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, doted of the anti-tumor response [377]. It was 
firstly identified by Morgan and colleagues in 1976 as “T-cell growth factor” (TCGF) [378]. 
Among other things, IL-2 can modulate the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th1 and Th2 
[147], increase the cytolytic activity of NKs, induce the development of Treg and cytotoxic 
T cells (CD8+ T cells), while it can both inhibit the differentiation of Th17, but also stimulate 
their expansion [148]. In addition, IL-2 promotes autocrine survival and cytolytic activity of 
T and NK cells in anti-tumor immunity [379]. The main sources of IL-2 are antigen-

Therefore, IL-12 can be considered a strong candidate for immunotherapy-based
interventions. It may be beneﬁcial in controlling tumor growth by activating effective anti-
tumor cytotoxic immune responses and killing tumor cells by tumor-speciﬁc cytotoxic NK
and CD8+ T cells [373,374]. Recombinant human IL-12 (rhIL-12) is currently in clinical trials
for the treatment of cancer and may also play a beneficial role in synergy with chemotherapy
(through activation of NK cells) and radiation therapy (reducing complications) [356,375,376].
Various therapies have been devised. For advanced solid tumors, such as breast, a mRNA-
based IL-12 delivery (SAR441000), an mRNA mixture encoding IL-12sc, interferon alpha2b,
GM-CSF, and IL-15sushi/ is being evaluated [374].
10. Interleukin-2 (IL-2)
IL-2 is a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine, doted of the anti-tumor response [377]. It was
ﬁrstly identiﬁed by Morgan and colleagues in 1976 as “T-cell growth factor” (TCGF) [378].
Among other things, IL-2 can modulate the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th1 and
Th2 [147], increase the cytolytic activity of NKs, induce the development of Treg and
cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells), while it can both inhibit the differentiation of Th17, but
also stimulate their expansion [148]. In addition, IL-2 promotes autocrine survival and
cytolytic activity of T and NK cells in anti-tumor immunity [379]. The main sources of
IL-2 are antigen-stimulated CD4+ T cells, but it can also be produced by activated CD8+ T
cells [136], activated DCs, and NK cells [137,138].
IL-2 exerts its effects by binding to the IL-2 receptor subunits, IL-2Rα (CD25), IL-2Rβ
(CD122), and IL-2Rγ (CD132), with different afﬁnities [380,381]. The α chain is unique
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4002
19 of 40
to IL-2 and binds it with low afﬁnity, without transducing a signal because of its short
intracellular chain [382]. IL-2Rβ is the key component of the IL-15 receptor, whereas
the γ chain is shared by the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 [136].
Notably, the α chain functions to initially bind IL-2, which localizes it to the cell surface,
effectively increasing its concentration and also inducing a conformational change in IL-
2R. Heterodimerization of the intermediate (IL-2Rβγ) and high afﬁnity (IL-2Rαβγ) [383]
receptor is essential for the activation of several IL-2 transducers and T cell signaling [384].
IL-2Rα can be expressed by naïve T cells (can be triggered rapidly by T cell receptor TCR),
activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, mature DCs, B cells, and endothelial cells [144–146]. In
addition, Tregs and some NK cells can also express high levels of the α chain after the
IL-2 stimulation [385], allowing them to consume IL-2 more efﬁciently than CD4+ and
CD8+ effector, even at low levels [386] (Figure 2). The IL-2Rβ is mainly expressed by Treg,
memory CD8+ T cells, and NK cells. The intracellularly stored IL-2Rγ subunit is expressed
primarily by hematopoietic cells [387], some tumor cells [143], and by CD4+ T only during
activation [388], whereas the dimeric IL-2Rβγ receptor is expressed by memory CD8+ cells,
naïve, T, and NK cells. Tregs and activated T cells express high levels of trimeric IL-2Rαβγ
complex [387].
Further binding of IL-2 to its receptor, IL-2Rβγ or IL-2Rαβγ complex, results in ac-
tivation of the JAK1 and JAK3, which activate the recruitment and phosphorylation of
STAT transcription factors, primarily STAT5, but also STAT1 and STAT3. Subsequently,
three major signaling pathways, including PI3K-AKT, JAK-STAT, and MAPK/ERK are acti-
vated [149] to mediate cell growth, survival, and differentiation, and cytokine production
(IL-4, IL-6, IL-12) [150,151]. Thus, in breast cancer [389], IL-2 plays an anti-tumor effect [390]
due to increased recruitment of IL-2-releasing NK cells and the induction of anti-apoptotic
function in CD8+ T cells [391], the main effector of the antitumor response [392]. IL-2 can
promote activation and proliferation of CD8+ T cells in early tumor stage but can deplete
CD8+ T cells in late tumor stage [393] (Figure 1).
The multiple effects of IL-2 signaling on the different cell types present in the TME
may be beneﬁcial in developing T cells and controlling tumor growth by activating effective
antitumor cytotoxic immune responses and killing tumor cells. Thus, IL-2 administration
and adoptive transfer of antitumor T cells cultured with IL-2 have represented highly
effective therapies in patients with solid human cancers, such as metastatic renal cancer,
and melanoma [33,386].
11. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)
IFN-γ is named after its ability to interfere with virus growth [24]. It is a pluripotent
cytokine that plays a controversial role in the immunomodulation, anti-microbial/anti-viral
host defense, allergies [165,166], autoimmune diseases [168], obesity [167], and antitumor
immunity [25]. It enhances the response to inﬂammatory molecules (TLR ligands and
TNF [394]), cytotoxic function of NK cells [395], and the number of M1-macrophages [396]
to provide phagocytic activity [397,398]. It is an important autocrine signal in the innate im-
mune response and a paracrine signal in the adaptive response [399]. During inﬂammation,
CD4+ Th1 cells are the main source of IFN-γ that promotes IFN-γ production by Th1 and
NK cells [400,401]. IFN-γ triggers the activation of the proinﬂammatory response [169] by
promoting differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th1 and Th2 cells [171], increasing the
killing capacity of CD8+ T cells [172] and decreasing the proliferation of Tregs [173]. In DCs,
IFN-γ signaling contributes to their maturation, production of IL-12, IL-1β, and activation
of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells [402]. These cells can be stimulated in an inﬂammatory or tumor
microenvironment by antigens secreted by the tumor or pathogen [403], IFN-γ itself via
positive feedback [404], or IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 [405,406] to activate IFN-γ production.
IFN-γ has been shown to interact with a heterodimeric receptor composed of two sub-
units, IFN receptor 1 (IFNGR1) and IFN receptor 2 (IFNGR2), expressed on the surface of
nearly all types of cells to regulate the immune response [407,408]. Secreted IFN-γ binds to
its receptor (IFNGR1/2) and can activate the JAK(1/2)-STAT pathway (1/3/4) [160,161],
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4002
20 of 40
AP-1 [409] and subsequently the up-regulation of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and
interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including those for MHC presentation [394,410,411].
In the TME, the concentration of IFN-γ determines whether the function will be anti
or pro-tumorigenic. A high dose of IFN-γ stimulates JAK-STAT1 signaling [155,412,413]
and can induce cancer cell death and apoptosis. However, low doses of IFN-γ produced at
the tumor site by host-inﬁltrating cells or during immunotherapy can enhance tumor cell
survival, induce risk of metastasis and expression of EMT transcription factors [174,175]
via activation of ICAM1-PI3K-Akt-Notch1 signaling in cancer cells [414]. IFN-γ production
by NK, NKT, CD8+ T, Th1, and γδ T cells stimulates and enhances immunorecognition,
recruitment of immune cells to tumor sites and subsequently increases the ability to kill
tumor cells [406], by improving the anti-proliferative status of cancer cells (growth inhi-
bition, cell death, autophagy) [415], tumor cell antigenicity, and metastasis reduction by
up-regulating ﬁbronectin [155]. IFN-γ arrests the cell cycle and initiates apoptosis in tumor
cells (up-regulation of p21 and p27 [416], granzyme B and perforin [417,418]). In addition,
IFN-γ can increase the destruction of established tumor-associated blood vessels [419,420],
inhibit the migration of TAMs to enhance the efﬁcacy of anti-PD1 antibody therapy [421]
(Figures 1–3).
Chronic high-dose IFN-γ release [422], loss of the IFN-γ receptor [423], prolonged
IFN-γ signaling in tumor cells, and PD-L1 expression (cancer and immune inﬁltrating
cells) [424,425], may induce apoptosis in CD4+ T-cells, suppress immune and secondary
antitumor immune response [176], cause immune evasion adaptive immune resistance to
immune checkpoint therapy [177]. Therefore, IFN-γ is believed to be one of the critical
factors determining the success of immunotherapy because dysregulation of IFN-γ respon-
siveness and/or signaling is often associated with resistance to immunotherapy [426–429].
12. Interleukin 10 (IL-10)
IL-10 is known as human cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor [430], with multiple and
pleiotropic effects in immunoregulation, infection, inﬂammation, autoimmunity, transplan-
tation, and tumorigenesis [431]. It is a cytokine with potent anti-inﬂammatory properties
by repressing the expression of inﬂammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1 and
is considered one of the most crucial immunosuppressive cytokines in tumor progression.
In general, IL-10 is mainly produced by Th2, Th1, Treg [178], and Th17, and also by CD8+ T
cells, monocytes, macrophages, DCs [179], B cells [180], mast cells, eosinophils [181], ker-
atinocytes, epithelial cells, and even some tumor cells [182,183]. The IL-10-producing cell
type depends on the inducing stimulus, e.g., Th1, Th17 cells, and macrophages represent
an important source of IL-10 in infectious diseases [432].
IL-10 receptor is a two-receptor complex consisting of two copies of IL-10 receptor
1 (IL-10R1) and IL-10R2 [430]. Both subunits belong to the class II cytokine receptor family.
IL-10R1 forms speciﬁc high-afﬁnity interactions with IL-10, whereas IL-10R2 is a shared
low-afﬁnity receptor that participates in receptor complexes with other cytokines, such
as IL-22, IL-26, IL-28, IFN-γ, and IL-29, which play critical roles in host defense [433].
DCs [184], T cells, B cells, NK, Treg, and mast cells express IL-10R1, whereas the IL-10R2
subunit is ubiquitously expressed. In humans, IL-10 ﬁrst binds to IL10R1, and then this
complex binds to IL10R2, forming a heterotetramer (two IL10R1/two IL10R2), allowing the
assembly of the IL-10R complex, which is the ﬁrst step in the initiation of IL-10 signaling
pathways. Once the complex is assembled, Jak1 and Tyk2 associated with IL-10R1 and
IL-10R2, respectively, are activated and phosphorylate the intracellular cytoplasmic tails
of the IL10R1 subunit. This results in the recruitment and phosphorylation/activation
of STAT3 and STAT1 or STAT5 under certain conditions [430]. STAT3 is most notably
associated with IL-10 signaling, recruited to IL-10R1 [434] upon IL-10 binding, driving
the expression of anti-inﬂammatory mediators that block various inﬂammatory pathways.
The silencing of STAT3 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) protein reduces
the IL-10 expression [435]. In addition, IL-10 is involved in MAPK inhibition and/or
activation of a PI3K/AKT inhibitory pathway [183] and can inhibit NF-κB translocation
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4002
21 of 40
to the nucleus and DNA binding [436], whereas hyper induction and production of high
levels of IL-10 are due to MAPK/ERK activation. In macrophages, IL-10 activates the
PI3K/Akt/GSK3 β-signaling cascade and modulates downstream transcription [437] and
PI3K-mediated mTORC1 activity in monocytes [438]. The IL10 response leads to the expres-
sion of anti-inﬂammatory mediators that block various inﬂammatory pathways, therefore
has prominent role in regulating intestinal inﬂammation, tumor immunosuppression, viral
infection, allergic reactions [185]. For example, IL-10 down-regulates the expression of
co-stimulatory molecules on macrophages, differentiation and maturation of DCs, activa-
tion of CD4+ Tcells [188,189]. It also inhibits the production of proinﬂammatory cytokines
such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, CSF, and TNF-α, suppresses Th1-associated cytokines
(IL-2, IFN-γ) [186], and stimulates B and NK cell survival and proliferation, as well as their
production of antibodies and cytokines [187].
The role of IL-10 in modulating the tumor immune response appears to be dependent
on the TME and the number of IL-10 receptors expressed on immune cells. IL10 is primarily
produced and expressed by M2/TAM, lymphocytes and cancer cells [439]. It contributes
positively to tumor growth and promotion (STAT3 in cancer cells), angiogenesis, tumor
escape, and metastasis [191]. Furthermore, IL-10 levels increases TGF-β excretion in Treg
cells and macrophages and then promotes EMT [190]. Similarly, TGF-β in combination
with IL-6, induces IL-10 secretion by Th-17 cells [440]. In addition, IL-10 can suppress T-cell
proliferation and activity in breast cancer [191] and inhibit T-cell-stimulated anti-tumor im-
munity by down-regulating MHC class II (APC). IL-10 produced by TAMs and activation of
the IL-10/STAT3/BCL-2 signaling pathway have been reported to contribute to therapeutic
resistance in irradiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy [441,442] (Figures 1 and 2).
Therefore, targeting IL-10 may provide a new therapeutic opportunity for cancer. The
use of PEG-IL-10 (pegilodecakin) and anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab or nivolumab)) treatment
to suppress Il-10 signaling [443] or PEGylated human IL-10 (PEG-rhuIL-10), has been
designed for clinical use in patients with advanced solid tumors. These strategies are
effective in stimulating IFN-γ secretion, perforin, and granzyme B production by CD8+ T
cells and decreasing TGFβ levels [444].
13. Conclusions
The microenvironment signiﬁcantly affects immune cell response, activation, differ-
entiation, and cytokine secretion. It can enhance the pro- and antitumorigenic response,
mediate inﬂammation and oncogenesis depending on cytokine interference. Many solid
tumors, including breast cancer, are composed of heterogeneous cell populations that
interact in complex networks through a mixture of cytokines. These are generated by innate
or adaptive immune cells, immunocompetent cells, stromal cells, and some cancer cells to
inhibit tumor growth, such as IL-2, IL-12, IFNs, or promote tumorigenesis, proliferation,
and/or invasion, such as, IL-23, IL-17, TGF- β, IL-10, and some adipokines including leptin,
TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6. Adipokines may contribute to an obesity-related state of low-grade
inﬂammation, regulate energy expenditure, inﬂammation, cancer growth, progression,
and metastasis. Therefore, inﬂammatory cytokines generated by cancer-associated cells,
such as TAMs, CAFs, Th17s, and Tregs, can be expressed by both immune and cancer
cells and promote breast cancer, and especially cancer-associated inﬂammation, such as
obesity-associated breast cancer. Thus, they induce tumor-associated inﬂammation, prolif-
eration, survival, progression, escape, migration, invasiveness, and metastasis of cancer.
They decrease the inﬁltration of Th1, CD8+ T cells, NKs, Tregs, promote the inﬁltration of
Th2, M2/TAMs and CAFs and their secretion of pro-tumor immunosuppressive cytokines.
Figure 2 summarizes the crosstalk and the immunoregulation between all of these actors.
Although they can be activated, such as JAK/STAT, PI3K, AKT, Rac, MAPK, JunB, cFos,
and mTORC, involved in the activation of proliferation, survival, differentiation, and cell
migration, NF-κB, JNK, and P38 are involved in inﬂammation, metastatic protein (MMP,
COX-2), and anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-XL). Thus, it forms an immunosuppressive microen-
vironment to enhance tumorigenicity, cancer cell motility (via MMP9 expression, PI3K-Akt
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 4002

signaling), EMT (FoxC1 in cancer cells), and angiogenesis (activation of Ras/MAPK/PI3K,
NF-κB/VEGF). In the Figure 1, TYK2-mediated JAK/STAT signaling network is repre-
sented. Moreover, for tumor clearance and effective anti-tumor responses, many cytokines
attract effector immune cells, such as NKs, NKTs, M1s, CD8+ T cells, APC, and Th1, to
regulate immune surveillance, cytotoxic activity, and anti-apoptotic factors for CD8+ T
cells. In addition, they can stimulate the secretion of perforin, proteolytic enzymes, and
cell adhesion molecules and inhibit tumor induced Treg cells that suppress effector T cells
and impair the body’s immune response against cancer. Because of the critical role of cy-
tokines in the progression of various disorders, such as cancer, understanding the crosstalk
between cytokines can provide important insights into immune-related mechanisms of
cancer development, and this knowledge can then be applied to cancer treatment.
