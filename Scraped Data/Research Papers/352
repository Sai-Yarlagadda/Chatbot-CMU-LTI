Abstract.
Background/Aim:
Activated
leukocyte
cell
adhesion molecule (ALCAM) plays an important role in
cancer via its homotypical and heterotypical interactions
with ALCAM or other proteins and can also mediate cell-cell
interactions. The present study investigated the expression of
ALCAM in relation to epithelial–to–mesenchymal transition
(EMT) markers and its downstream signal proteins including
Ezrin-Moesin-Radixin (ERM), in clinical colon cancer and
in the progression of the disease. Materials and Methods:
Expression of ALCAM was determined in a clinical colon
cancer cohort and assessed against the clinical pathological
factors and outcome, together with the expression patterns
of the ERM family and EMT markers. ALCAM protein was
detected using immunohistochemistry. Cell line models, with
ALCAM knock-down and over-expression, were established
and used to test cells’ responses to drugs. Results: Tumours
from patients who had distant metastasis and died of colon
cancer had low levels of ALCAM. Dukes B and C tumours
also had lower ALCAM expression than Dukes A tumours.
Patients with high levels of ALCAM had a significantly
longer overall and disease-free survival than those with
lower ALCAM levels (p=0.040 and p=0.044). ALCAM is not
only significantly correlated with SNAI1 and TWIST, also
positively correlated with SNAI2. ALCAM enhanced the
adhesiveness of colorectal cancer, an effect inhibited by both
sALCAM
and
SRC
inhibitors.
Finally,
high
ALCAM
expression
rendered
cells
resistant,
especially
to
5-
fluorouracil. Conclusion: Reduced expression of ALCAM in
colon cancer is an indicator of disease progression and a
poor prognostic indicator for patient’s survival. However,
ALCAM can enhance the adhesion ability of cancer cells and
render them resistant to chemotherapy drugs.
Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), also
known as CD166, plays a pivotal role in mediating cell
adhesion, including in cancer cells. It has a rather ubiquitous
distribution in the human body, and is and is highly
expressed highly expressed in the nervous tissue, pancreas,
thyroid, and parathyroid tissues. ALCAM confers homotypic
and heterotypic adhesions between the same and different
cell types via both homotypic and heterotypic protein
interactions. Intracellularly, ALCAM anchors to the skeleton
by interacting with the Ezrin-Moesin-Radixin (ERM) family
of proteins (1, 2).
ALCAM has been studied for its role in cancer and cancer
development, which remains an active topic. In bronchial
epithelial cells, ALCAM promotes cell growth while it can
inhibit the metastasis of lung cancer (1). In breast cancer,
ALCAM has been shown to promote adhesion, proliferation,
and tumour growth (2). In some other tumours such as
glioma, higher ALCAM can induce migration (3). In clinical
cancers, ALCAM has a rather diverse expression pattern and
temporally opposite role in disease progression and
correlation with prognosis (4). For example, in mesothelioma
(5), gastric cancer (6), oesophageal cancer (7) and pancreatic
cancer (8) high levels of ALCAM in tumours represent an
indicator for poor prognosis. ALCAM has been recently
found to promote distant metastasis and regional/
transcoelomic spreading by promoting the seed and soil
process (9, 10). In other cancer types however, ALCAM has
been reported to be a favourable prognostic factor including
breast cancer (11), thyroid cancer (12), prostate cancer (13),
although localization of ALCAM in cancer cells, namely
cytoplasmic and membranous compartments, in these tumour
types, have shown a different connection with the disease
progression.

Colon cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide
and has a higher incidence in developed countries (14). In
the USA, the 5-year survival is around 60%, while in less
developed countries it is lower than 40%. The study of
ALCAM in this cancer type remains controversial. In a
tissue array based study with 299 patients, low levels of
ALCAM protein staining were shown to be a favourable
prognostic factor for overall survival of the colon cancer
patients (7). ALCAM-negative colon tumour tends to have a
greater risk of developing lymph node metastasis and distant
metastasis than ALCAM-positive tumours (15). However, an
early study has shown that positive membrane ALCAM, not
cytoplasmic ALCAM, is an adverse prognostic factor (16),
which is in clear contrast to another study, which reported
that cytoplasmic ALCAM was associated with a poor clinical
outcome of patients (17). ALCAM has been shown to be a
potential biomarker of epithelial–to–mesenchymal transition
(EMT) (18). As for the distant metastasis of cancer, ALCAM
is positively correlated with liver metastasis of colorectal
cancer by interacting with SOSTDC1 (19). For clinical
therapy, it has also been found that when colon cancer
patients are treated with 5-fluorouracil, ALCAM expression

is not an important factor, which can help to predict the
response (20). In contrast, Sim et al. reported that patients
with high ALCAM had a longer disease-free survival when
treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (21). Thus, the impact of
ALCAM remains unclear in colon cancer, 
The present study investigated the expression of ALCAM
at transcript and protein levels, in a cohort of colorectal cancer
and, by creating cell models with differential expression of
ALCAM, tested cells’ response to chemotherapeutic drugs. 
Materials and Methods
Colorectal cohort for gene transcript analysis. A cohort of 94
colorectal fresh tumour tissues and matched normal tissues (15 cm
away from tumour margins), were collected immediately after surgery
at the University Hospital of Wales (Heath Park, Cardiff, UK), as we
previously reported (22, 23). Patients with other cancers, with family
history of cancers and patients who received chemotherapy before
surgery, were excluded from the study. The median age was 73 years
(range=25-88 years). The collection was made under research ethics
approval by the local research ethics committee, Bro Taf Research
Ethics Committee (Ref. 05/DMD/3562). The clinical, pathological
and outcome information were retrospectively collected after surgery
and during the follow-up. Tissues, stored at –80˚C, were processed
using frozen sections for RNA extraction (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck
KGaA, Dorset, UK) and reverse transcription using a reverse
transcription kit from Promega Corporation (Southampton, UK).
Colon cancer cell lines. Human colorectal cancer cell lines, HT115,

Collection of Animal Cell Culture, Salisbury, UK). RKO cells were
routinely cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FCS), penicillin (100
unit/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). 
Key materials. The plasmids which contained shRNA targeting
ALCAM, a plasmid with expression cassette of human ALCAM,
and control plasmids containing scramble sequence, were purchased
from VectorBuilder (Chicago, IL, USA) and have been previously
reported (4, 24). An ALCAM antagonist, soluble ALCAM, was
purchased from R&D systems (Abingdon, UK). The fluorescence
dye, DiI (1,1’-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’Tetramethylindocarbocyanine
Perchlorate), was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset, UK).
Small inhibitor to SRC, AZM475271, was from Tocris (Bristol,
UK). Antibody to human ALCAM was from Novacastra (Milton
Keynes, UK) and GAPDH was from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies
(Santa Cruz, TX, USA).
Generation of genetically modified colon cancer cells. Colon cancer
cells were transfected with the shRNA plasmids in order to establish
ALCAM knock-down cell models. Cells were subject to selection
with 2 μg/ml puromycin (Fisher Scientific, Oxford, UK) and, once
tested for the success of genetic modification, were routinely
maintained in a maintenance medium (with 0.2 μg/ml puromycin).
Quantitative analyses of gene transcripts. ALCAM transcripts, in
cells and tissues, were determined using reverse transcription-
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or quantitative RT-
PCR, as previously reported (4, 25, 26). The levels of ALCAM in
cells and tissues were determined by qPCR, with application of a
molecular beacon based AmplifluorTM Uniprimer™ Universal qPCR
system (Intergen Inc., Oxford, UK). The system was characterised by
integrating a Z sequence (5’-ACTGAACCTGACCGTACA-3’) to the
FAM-tagged Uniprimer™ probe (Table I). The reaction and detection
were carried out using a StepOnePlusTM Real-Time PCR System
(Fisher Scientific). The amplification and detection conditions were:
95˚C for 10 min, 80 cycles of 95˚C for 10 s, 55˚C for 35 s
(programmed for signal detection) and 72˚C for 10 s. The transcripts
were quantified alongside an internal standard to allow calculation of
relative transcript copy numbers.
Protein preparation and electrophoresis. Protein was extracted from
cells with a lysis buffer containing NP40 and protein concentration
quantified using a BioRad protein quantitation kit (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hertfordshire, UK). Equal amounts of protein were
loaded to an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and subject to electrophoresis.
Protein was subsequently blotted onto PVDF membrane (Merck
Millipore, Hertfordshire, UK) using a semi-dry blotter. The
membrane was subject to blocking (containing 10% milk), probing
with the primary (overnight at 4˚C) and secondary HRP conjugated
antibody, each separated by extensive washing. Protein band was
visualized after immersing the membrane in an EZ-ECL solution
(equal parts of solution A mixed with solution B) (Geneflow Ltd.,
Litchfield, UK), on a G-BOX imager (Syngene, Cambridge, UK).
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. The IHC staining for
ALCAM was performed using a tissue microarray (TMA,
CO2161b) (178 cases of adenocarcinoma, 26 cases of Mucinous
adenocarcinoma, 2 signet-ring cell carcinoma and 8 normal colon
tissue). Sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated through a

graded series of ethanol/distilled water, ending with a final wash in
PBS. Following a 2-hour blocking step with 10% horse serum
(Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA), the sections were incubated
overnight at 4˚C with the appropriate primary antibody (diluted to
a final concentration of 2 mg/ml in the blocking serum). After
washing thoroughly in PBS, the staining protocol proceeded using
the Vectastain Universal Elite ABC Kit (cat no. PK-6200; Vectastain
Universal Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Newark, CA, USA)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, sections were
incubated for 30 min with the biotinylated secondary antibody from
the kit, washed with PBS, incubated at room temperature for 30 min
with ABC tertiary reagent before the staining was developed using
3,3’-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. The slides were then
briefly washed using tap water prior to counterstaining with Gill’s
haematoxylin. This was followed by washing with tap water,
dehydrating in a graded series of ethanol, clearing in xylene, and
mounting with dibutylphthalate polystyrene xylene. The staining
was examined using a light microscope and scored (0=negative,
1=weak, 2=moderate, 3=strong).
Implication of ALCAM in responses of patients to therapies and
angiogenesis. The public dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) was explored (27). The relationship of levels of ALCAM
with patients’ responses to chemotherapy was analysed using
www.rocplot.com (accessed June 2022) (28). The responses were
tested using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method for
the chosen gene probes (201951_at), to allow classification of the
patients based on their responses to chemotherapy. The levels of
ALCAM in the chemo-responsive and non-responsive groups were
compared using Mann-Whitney U-test. 
Evaluation of cell adhesion and migration by electric cell-substrate
impedance sensing (ECIS). We employed an established method,
ECIS, to assess cell adhesiveness and migration of colon cancer
cells. This was based on the ECIS Z-Theta model (Applied
Biophysics, Troy, NY, USA) using a method previously described
(4, 29, 30). Briefly, the 96W1E array was first prepared by clearing
the gold surface with the built in function of ECIS Z-Theta. Colon
cancer cells, control or ALCAM genetically modified cells, were
added to the arrays in the presence or absence of soluble ALCAM
(sALCAM) or SRC inhibitor. The arrays were monitored
immediately for up to 20 hours.
Cell growth and cytotoxicity assays. Two days after transient
transfection, cells were harvested and seeded in each well (5,000
cells in 100 μl medium) on a 96-well-plate, treated with indicated
chemotherapy drugs at different concentrations. Serially diluted
chemotherapy drugs including 5-FU (range=0.064-1,000 μM),

Docetaxel (DTX; range=0.064-1,000 nM), AG825 (range=0.032-
500 μM) and Oxaliplatin (range=0.064-1,000 μM) were added into
the 96-well plates. After incubation with chemotherapy drugs for 48
h, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde at room temperature
for 15 min, followed by crystal violet (0.5%) staining for 10 min.
After gently washing the plate to remove the excess crystal violet,
100 μl of acetic acid (10%) was added into each well of the dry
plate. Absorbance at the wavelength of 595 nm was read to assess
the cytotoxicity of the drugs in each group. Each group was
repeated three times. IC50 values were calculated based on
logarithmic trend line.
Statistical methods. All statistical analyses were conducted using
SPSS (version 27.0; IBM, Portsmouth, UK). Survival analysis was
performed using the Kaplan-Meier with log ranked method and Cox
Regression. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to check whether samples
originate from the same distribution. Correlation was determined
using Spearman’s correlation methods. Pairwise sample comparisons
were obtained using unpaired Student’s t-test and Mann-Whitney U-
test for normally and non-normally distributed data sets as
appropriate. Comparison of multiple groups were conducted using
ANOVA test followed by Bonferroni correction. p<0.05 was
considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
Expression of ALCAM in colon tissues. In the Cardiff clinical
cohort, qPCR results showed that there was no significant
difference in the levels of the ALCAM transcript between

normal and tumour tissues. ALCAM was down-regulated in
TNM2 and TNM3 tumours compared with TNM1.
Compared with tumours from the disease-free group,
ALCAM in tumours from a relapsed colon cancer had a
lower expression (Table II).
To further verify the ALCAM expression in colon cancer
patients, a colon TMA was used for IHC staining. ALCAM
expression was increased in colon cancer tissue compared
with normal tissue (p<0.001, by Chi-square test) (Figure 1,
Table III). There was a marginal increase of the staining
from stage I to IV. This difference was not significant.
ALCAM and patients’ clinical outcome. There was a
significant difference in the overall survival; patients with
high levels of ALCAM had a significantly longer overall
survival (OS) than those with lower ALCAM (137.6±9.5
months versus 53.2±6.3 months, respectively, p=0.040)
(Figure 2). Likewise, patients with higher ALCAM had a
significantly longer disease-free survival (DFS) than those
with lower ALCAM (132.6±10.1 months versus 49.3±7.0
months, respectively, p=0.044) (Figure 2). A similar trend
was observed with distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS),
although the difference did not reach significance (p=0.117).
For both OS and DFS, ALCAM is a favourable prognostic
indicator with hazard ratio at 0.416 for OS and 0.423 for
DFS, again ALCAM does not appear to be a significant
indicator for DMFS (HR=0.484, p>0.05) (Table IV).
Patients’ response to chemotherapy and ALCAM expression.
Previous studies reported that ALCAM is associated with
EMT progression and affects the response to chemotherapy,
which was also examined in the Cardiff clinical cohort. The
results show that ALCAM has little effect on the response to
different drugs used in clinical therapy, as demonstrated from
the public dataset (Figure 3, Table V).
Correlation of ALCAM, EMT markers, ERM family and the
Her family members. We analysed the correlation between
ALCAM and a set of markers, including EMT markers (Table
VI), the Her family (Table VII) and the ERM family (Table
VIII), in normal colon and tumour tissues. In tumour tissues,
ALCAM was significantly correlated with TWIST1, SNAI1

and SNAI2. In contrast, ALCAM was negatively correlated
with E-cadherin in normal tissue but not in tumour tissues
(Table VI). In normal tissues, ALCAM had significant
correlation with Her1, Her2, and Her3, whereas in tumour
tissues this was significant with Her1 and Her4 (Table VII).
Finally, the relationship between ALCAM and the ERM
family members, the cytoskeletal anchoring proteins for
ALCAM in the cells, was also analysed. The only significant
correlation was observed between ALCAM and EHM2 in
normal tissues, but not in tumour tissues (Table VIII). 
Generation of ALCAM knock-down and over-expression
cell models. Three human colon cancer cell lines, with
differing expression profiles of ALCAM, were chosen to
create cell models. These were RKO and HT115 cells, that
expressed high levels of ALCAM, and HRT18 cells, which
expressed low levels of ALCAM (Figure 4). ALCAM
knock-down, by way of shRNA, was successfully achieved
in RKO and HT115 cells (Figure 4 left). An ALCAM over-
expression model was also established in HRT18 cells
following transfection with an ALCAM expression plasmid
(Figure 4, right).

function. ALCAM was
positively correlated with EMT progression, which can affect
cell adhesion and migration. ECIS was used to investigate
whether ALCAM expression could affect the cell adhesion
ability. After ALCAM knock-down in RKO and HT115 cell
lines, there was no significant change (Figure 5A and B). In
the HRT18 cell line with ALCAM over-expression, the
adhesion ability was significantly higher compared with the
control group transfected by blank stuffer plasmid (Figure
5C). Furthermore, a cell growth assay showed that ALCAM
did not affect proliferation in colon cancer cells (Figure 6).

and HRT18 (C).

was applied to measure the adherence ability.
Compared with cells incubated in control medium, RKO,
HT115 and HRT18 with higher ALCAM expression, treated
with 400 nM SRC inhibitor (AZM475271), had reduced
adhesion ability compared with these three cell lines with a
lower ALCAM expression (Figure 5 and Figure 7A, B, and
C). A soluble ALCAM was also found to have a similar
effect to SRC inhibitor, which inhibited the adhesion ability
of colon cancer cells (Figure 5 and Figure 7D, E, and F).
ALCAM expression and cells responses to chemotherapeutic
drugs. Using the cell models generated here, we further validated
responses of cell lines to chemotherapy drugs (Table IX and
Table X). Lower ALCAM expression was associated with a
lower IC50 of 5-FU and docetaxel, in all three different cell lines.
For oxaliplatin, this correlation was only observed in the HRT18
cell line. Furthermore, we also examined the effect of Her2
inhibitor (Table X). The response to AG825 did not appear to
correspond to the levels of ALCAM in the cells (Table X).
Discussion
In the present study, we reported that ALCAM transcript
expression level is a favourable prognostic marker in colon
cancer. High levels of ALCAM were observed in patients
with longer overall, disease-free, and metastasis-free survival.
The clinical association between ALCAM and colon
cancer has remained unclear. Previously, it was shown that
ALCAM expression, examined using immunohistochemical
staining, was a favourable factor for the patients (13) and
that ALCAM negative tumours had a high tendency for
lymph node metastasis (15). Our study adds further evidence
to that of Tachezy’s, that in addition to protein level,
ALCAM transcript level is also a good prognostic indicator.
Although we did not detect a significant difference of
ALCAM transcript levels between node negative and node
positive tumours, we have shown a significant reduction of
ALCAM transcript in TNM2 and TNM3 tumours. In
consideration of the sharp contrast when assessing the
subcellular location of ALCAM and the clinical significance
(16, 17), our present study, together with that of Tachezy,
indicates that assessment of total transcript and total protein
in tumour tissues may be a more practical way of evaluation
of clinical correlations in colon cancer.
There has been some evidence that patients with higher
ALCAM may have a better outcome, after treatment with 5-
FU (21). Here, we interrogate a public database which has
some limited information on the response of patients to drug
treatment and the ALCAM transcript levels. It was surprising
that there was no significant correlation between the levels
of ALCAM and patients’ response to chemotherapeutic drugs
including 5-FU, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and capecitabine, but
not to Avastin. Our cell models do, however, show that low
levels of ALCAM rendered them more sensitive to 5-FU,
and HT115 and RKO cells to docetaxel but had little effect
on their response to oxaliplatin. Collectively, this suggests
that ALCAM may indeed have some impact, at the cellular
level, on cells’ response to drugs. This clearly needs to be
validated in clinical studies with a larger cohort size. 
ALCAM expression can be triggered by increased TWIST
expression in some colon cancer cell lines (18), tentatively
indicating that ALCAM may be involved in the EMT process.
Here, we showed that ALCAM is positively correlated with
some EMT markers including SnaI1, Slug, and Twist in colon
cancer tissues, yet negatively correlated with E-cadherin in
normal colon tissues. This contrasting correlation in tumour
and normal tissues is very interesting and may indicate, that
at the tissue level, reduced ALCAM, and potentially in
correlation with the EMT process, may contribute to the less
aggressive tumour type, hence renders patients with a
favourable clinical outcome. In the correlation analysis with
the ALCAM anchorage proteins, there was no significant
correlation with ezrin, moesin, and radixin. However, our
ECIS-based cell analyses did not show a marked change in the
adhesiveness of HT115 and RKO cells. HRT18 cells with
over-expressed ALCAM did show a significant effect on
adhesiveness and this was ameliorated by treating with an
SRC kinase inhibitor. Although this result should not be over-
interpreted, it does suggest a potential connection between
ALCAM and the EMT process in this cancer type, which is
certainly worth further exploration in the future.

There have been reports that ALCAM, when integrated
with the expression of Her family members, namely
EGFR/Her1 and Her2, may bear some clinical significance in
assessing the prognosis and in determining cell behaviour, in
this case in breast cancer and squamous cell carcinoma (31,
32). Here, we also examined the correlation between ALCAM
and all four Her family members. Normal and tumour tissues
showed a different pattern of correlations, in that ALCAM
correlated with Her1 and Her4 in tumours and with Her1,
Her2 and Her3 in normal tissues. This interesting finding may
suggest that in the context of ALCAM in colon cancer, Her2
may not be a key player in cell’s responses to drugs in the
context of ALCAM expression, as it was shown that the Her2
inhibitor in the cell model did not respond differently in cells
with a different ALCAM expression pattern. 
In conclusion, higher ALCAM transcript levels in colon
cancer tissues are a good prognostic indicator for patients
and is, to some degree, inversely correlated with disease
progression. ALCAM may also have a role in the drug
response of colon cancer cells.
