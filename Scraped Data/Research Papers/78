Objectives: Teicoplanin has been extensively used in the treatment for infections
caused by gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA). However, current teicoplanin treatment is challenging due to
relatively low and variable concentrations under standard dosage regimens. This
study aimed to investigate the population pharmacokinetics (PPK) characteristics
of teicoplanin in adult sepsis patients and provide recommendations for optimal
teicoplanin dosing regimens.
Methods: A total of 249 serum concentration samples from 59 septic patients
were prospectively collected in the intensive care unit (ICU). Teicoplanin
concentrations were detected, and patients’ clinical data were recorded. PPK
analysis was performed using a non-linear, mixed-effect modeling approach.
Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate currently recommended
dosing and other dosage regimens. The optimal dosing regimens were deﬁned
and compared by different pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters,
including trough concentration (Cmin), the ratio of 24-h area under the
concentration-time curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC0-24/
MIC), as well as the probability of target attainment (PTA) and the cumulative
fraction of response (CFR) against MRSA.
Results: A two-compartment model adequately described the data. The ﬁnal
model parameter estimates for clearance, central compartment volume of
distribution,
intercompartmental
clearance
and
peripheral
compartment
volume were 1.03 L/h, 20.1 L, 3.12 L/h and 101 L, respectively. Glomerular
ﬁltration rate (GFR) was the only covariate that signiﬁcantly affected teicoplanin
clearance. Model-based simulations revealed that 3 or 5 loading doses of 12/15 mg/kg
every 12 h followed by a maintenance dose of 12/15 mg/kg every 24 h–72 h
for patients with different renal functions were required to achieve a target Cmin
of 15 mg/L and a target AUC0-24/MIC of 610. For MRSA infections, PTAs and CFRs
were not satisfactory for simulated regimens. Prolonging the dosing interval may
be easier to achieve the target AUC0-24/MIC than reducing the unit dose for renal
insufﬁcient patients.

Conclusion: A PPK model for teicoplanin in adult septic patients was successfully
developed. Model-based simulations revealed that current standard doses may
result in undertherapeutic Cmin and AUC, and a single dose of at least 12 mg/kg may
be needed. AUC0-24/MIC should be preferred as the PK/PD indicator of teicoplanin,
if AUC estimation is unavailable, in addition to routine detection of teicoplanin Cmin
on Day 4, follow-up therapeutic drug monitoring at steady-state is recommended.

1 Introduction
Sepsis is deﬁned as life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting
from infection (Reinhart et al., 2017), with a worldwide incidence of
about 48.9 million per year in 2017 and an all-cause mortality rate
with sepsis remaining 12.5%–31.8% after 2010 in developed
countries (Shankar-Hari et al., 2017; Abe et al., 2018; Paoli et al.,
2018; Rudd et al., 2020). Sepsis affects approximately 30% of
intensive care unit (ICU) patients (Sakr et al., 2018), becoming
an important issue facing critical care medicine. Methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the main
pathogenic bacteria in sepsis patients (David and Daum, 2010).
Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic widely used in treating
infections
caused
by
drug-resistant
gram-positive
bacteria,
including MRSA, with comparable efﬁcacy, improved tissue
penetration, and reduced nephrotoxicity compared to other
existing glycopeptides such as vancomycin (Wilson et al., 1994;
Cavalcanti et al., 2010). Despite the similar mechanism of action to
vancomycin, teicoplanin presents different pharmacokinetic (PK)
characteristics. Unlike vancomycin, which has a plasma protein
binding rate of approximately 30%–55% and a half-life of 6–12 h in
adults with normal renal function, teicoplanin has a higher plasma
protein binding rate (about 90%) and a longer half-life (100–170 h),
enabling its administration once daily (Rowland, 1990; Rybak, 2006;
Cavalcanti et al., 2010). Unchanged teicoplanin is excreted mainly
by the urinary route (80% within 16 days) and only 2.7% of the dose
administered is recovered in feces (via bile excretion) within 8 days
after administration. Teicoplanin presents a low total clearance in
the range of 10–14 mL/h/kg and a renal clearance in the range of
8–12 mL/h/kg, indicating that teicoplanin is mainly excreted
through renal mechanisms (EMA., 2022). Currently, teicoplanin
has been applied as an alternative treatment option for vancomycin,
making it one of the most frequently administered antimicrobial
agents in sepsis patients. However, since septic patients often present
with multiple organ insufﬁciency and hypoalbuminemia, and are
prone to PK changes such as increased volume of distribution
(Ramos-Martín et al., 2017), developing an effective and safe
teicoplanin
dosing
regimen
for
sepsis
patients
remains
challenging in clinical practice. Previous studies revealed that the
standard teicoplanin dosing regimens often fail to achieve adequate
exposure for these patients. Additionally, optimal dosing regimens
of teicoplanin for treating MRSA infections in sepsis patients have
not been deﬁned (Ueda et al., 2014; Hanai et al., 2022).
Therefore, the optimization of dosing regimens according to
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters should be
recommended to improve clinical outcomes (Wei et al., 2021). As a
time-dependent antibacterial drug with a long post-antibiotic effect
(PAE), the PK/PD index that best correlates with teicoplanin
antibacterial activity is the ratio of the 24-h area under the
concentration-time
curve
to
the
minimum
inhibitory
concentration
(AUC0-24/MIC)
(Ramos-Martín
et
al.,
2017).
Previous studies have shown that AUC0-24/MIC ≥610 was a
suitable PK/PD target (Ramos-Martín et al., 2017; Abdul-Aziz
et
al.,
2020).
However,
because
MIC
detection
and
AUC
estimation are unavailable in many institutions, teicoplanin
trough concentration is recommended as a surrogate indicator in
clinical practice (Harding et al., 2000; Pea et al., 2003; Gemmell et al.,
2006; Kobayashi et al., 2010; Tobin et al., 2010). According to the
latest consensus review by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy
and the Japanese Society of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM)
(Hanai et al., 2022), a target Cmin value of 15–30 mg/L results in
better clinical efﬁcacy and similar adverse effects in patients with
non-complicated MRSA infections compared with Cmin < 15 mg/L.
Additionally, a target Cmin value of 20–40 mg/L was recommended
in patients with complicated or serious MRSA infections despite
insufﬁcient evidence. Besides the above indicators, PTA, which
refers to the probability that the ratio of AUC0-24/MIC exceeds
the target value and the cumulative fraction of response (CFR),
deﬁned as the expected population PTA for speciﬁc dosage and
speciﬁc microbial population, were also applied to select the optimal
dosing regimens (Zhang et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2021).
Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) is a promising tool to
guide individualized rational dosing of antibiotics based on their PK/
PD targets. However, evidence supporting the MIPD approach for
teicoplanin dosage calculation is relatively scarce (Hanai et al.,
2022). Furthermore, though some population pharmacokinetic
(PPK) studies are currently available for teicoplanin dosage
optimization (Gao et al., 2020; Kontou et al., 2020; Ogami et al.,
2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Aulin et al., 2021; Sako et al., 2021), scarce
PPK studies have been conducted in sepsis patients (Hanada et al.,
2007; Brink et al., 2015; Kontou et al., 2020). Hence, this study aimed
to assess the PPK characteristics of teicoplanin and to propose an
optimal teicoplanin dosage regimen in ICU patients with sepsis
based on the above PK/PD indicators.

aged ≥18 years who were diagnosed with sepsis according to Sepsis
3.0 criteria (Singer et al., 2016), conﬁrmed or suspected with gram-
positive coccal infection, and expected to be treated with teicoplanin
for ≥4 days, were enrolled. Pregnant and lactating patients, patients
with special sites (endocardium, bone, joints, etc.) infections, or
those who received any special treatment that may affect drug
elimination, such as renal replacement therapy, were excluded.
For each patient, demographic information [sex, age, height,
weight, body mass index (BMI)], disease information (diagnosis,
combined disease), laboratory inspection information [alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total
bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), total protein (TP),
albumin (ALB), white blood count (WBC), serum creatinine
(Scr), glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), urea nitrogen (BUN)],
medication
information
[dosage,
formulation,
administration
time,
dosing
interval,
comedication]
and
teicoplanin
blood
concentrations were accurately recorded.
2.2 Dosing regimen and sample collection
According to the standard dosage regimen, teicoplanin was
intravenously infused at 400 mg every 12 h (q12h) for 3 doses,
followed by 400 mg once daily, and subsequent adjustments were
conducted according to patients’ response to the treatment. The
infusion duration was 30–60 min. A 2 mL teicoplanin blood sample
was collected at 4 time points (immediately before the 3rd, 4th, 5th,
and 6th teicoplanin doses) from each patient. Additionally, in 1/3
patients, 2 mL more blood sample was collected immediately
after the 5th infusion; in the other 1/3 patients, 2 mL more blood
sample was collected 1 h after the 5th dose, and in the remaining 1/3
patients, 2 mL more concentration sample was taken 1 h before the
6th dose. All blood samples were collected in blood collection tubes
anticoagulated by ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) for
concentration determination.
2.3 Bioanalytical assay
Teicoplanin concentrations were detected by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the Agilent 1,100 Series HPLC
System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Blood
samples were centrifuged within 12 h to obtain plasma. Then,
0.4 mL
plasma
samples
were
added
with
0.05 mL
internal
standard
solution
(piperacillin
sodium
0.15 mg/mL).
Consequently, 0.6 mL acetonitrile was added, and the sample was
vigorously shaken for 1 min and centrifuged at 12,000 r/min for
5 min. Then, 0.9 mL of the supernatant was transferred to a
centrifuge tube, and 0.4 mL of dichloromethane was added. The
solution was vigorously shaken for 1 min and centrifuged at
12,000 r/min for 5 min. The supernatant was then transferred
into a vial for detection. HPLC detection conditions were as
follows: Waters Symmetry C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm);
mobile phase: 0.01 mol/L NaH2PO4 (pH = 3.3)-acetonitrile (75:
25), isocratic elution; detection wavelength: 240 nm; ﬂow rate:
1.0 mL/min; injection volume: 0.020 mL; column temperature:
35 °C (Dong et al., 2011). The limit of quantiﬁcation (LOQ) of
teicoplanin was 3.125 μg/mL. The above analytical method has
passed the methodological veriﬁcation. The concentrations of
teicoplanin
presented
good
linearity
in
the
range
of
3.125–100 μg/mL (correlation coefﬁcient r = 0.9994). In terms of
sensitivity, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the LOQ was >10. The
relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the intra-day and inter-day
precision of simulated plasma samples with high, medium and low
concentrations were all less than 10%, and the intra-day and inter-
day
accuracies
were
91.01%–101.13%
and
92.98%–98.99%,
respectively. The extraction recovery of teicoplanin was above
90%. The stability of simulated plasma samples with high,
medium and low concentrations was good after being placed at
room temperature for 4 h, frozen and thawed 3 times and stored
at −80°C for 60 days, respectively, with the RSDs of tested samples all
less than 10%.
2.4 PPK modelling
Teicoplanin PPK modeling was conducted using the non-linear
mixed-effect modeling approach by NONMEM software (version
7.4, ICON Development Solutions).
The model was established in a stepwise manner. In the basic
model screening process, one-, two- and three-compartment models
with additive, proportional and mixed error were tested respectively,
and the basic model was selected by the objective function value
(OFV) and visual diagnostic plots (Gao et al., 2020). The model
parameters were assumed to follow a log-normal distribution, and
the inter-individual variability for each structural parameter was
modeled using the following equation:
Pi  PTV × Exp ηi
 
(1)
where Pi represents parameters for the ith individual, PTV are the
typical values of the parameters, and ηi are random variables with
zero mean and variance of ω2.
Demographic and clinical characteristics that were considered
plausible for affecting teicoplanin PK were tested as covariates,
including sex, age, height, weight, BMI, ALT, AST, TBIL, DBIL,
TP, ALB, WBC, Scr, GFR, and BUN. Individual PK estimates
obtained from the selected structural model were ﬁrstly plotted
against covariate values to assess relationships (Byrne et al., 2017).
When a relationship between the covariate and the PK parameter
was observed, the covariate was tested for inclusion into the PPK
model. Continuous covariates were incorporated into the model by
the following formula (Cazaubon et al., 2017):
CLi  CLpop × COViCOVmedian


β × eηCL,i
(2)
where CLi represents the CL of the ith subject, CLpop is the
population parameter estimate, COVi is the covariate value of
subject i, COVmedian is the median value of the covariate in the
study population, β is the covariate effect to be estimated, and ηCL,i
represents the individual random effect.
For binary covariates, the formula was:
CLi  CLpop × eβ·COVi × eηCL,i
(3)
where the value of COVi is 0 or 1.
If the inclusion of the covariates resulted in a decrease of >3.84 in
the OFV (P = 0.05, χ2 distribution with one degree of freedom), it

Chen et al.
10.3389/fphar.2023.1132367
was supported for inclusion in the full regression model (Roberts
et al., 2015). After that, the covariates were removed one by one from
the full regression model, and covariates resulting in an increase
of >10.828 in the OFV (P = 0.001, χ2 distribution with one degree of
freedom) were retained in the ﬁnal model.
2.5 Model diagnostics
The performance of the ﬁnal model was evaluated by internal
validations,
including
goodness-of-ﬁt
(GOF),
bootstrap
and
prediction corrected visual predictive check (pc-VPC). GOF
evaluation
was
performed
by
plotting
the
corresponding
individual (IPRED) and population predictive values (PRED)
against the observed values as well as the PRED and time against
conditional weighted residual errors (CWRES). A bootstrap
resampling
technique
was
used
for
model
validation.
One
thousand bootstrap-resampled data sets were generated from the
original model group data set, and each was individually ﬁtted to the
ﬁnal model. All parameters were estimated, and the median and 95%
conﬁdence intervals (CIs) (2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile)
were compared with the ﬁnal parameter estimates. Pc-VPC was used
to graphically assess the appropriateness of the compartment model
based on 1,000 replicates of the dataset (Bergstrand et al., 2011).
2.6 Dosage simulations
To provide recommendations for teicoplanin dosage selection,
Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the ﬁnal PPK model
with GFR covariate to generate PK proﬁles for candidate dosage
regimens. Trough concentrations on Day 4 (Cmin, 72h) and at steady
state 7 days after the initial TDM (Day 11, Cmin, 240h) (Hanai et al.,
2022) and the AUC0-24 were obtained from each condition. IV
teicoplanin loading doses ranging from 10–15 mg/kg, administered
every 12 h for either 3 or 5 doses with maintenance doses ranging
from 3–15 mg/kg, administered per 24–72 h to a typical 65 kg
patient were studied. Five GFR levels of 15, 30, 60, 90 and
120 mL/min/1.73 m2
were
simulated.
At
each
GFR
level,
1,000 simulations were performed for each candidate regimen.
The concentration-time proﬁle was simulated between 0 and 264 h.
AUC0-24 values estimated by the linear trapezoidal method from
the concentration-time proﬁles were divided by putative MIC values
to obtain AUC0-24/MIC ratios. According to the European
Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST,
https://mic.eucast.org/Eucast2/) data, MIC values of 0.25, 0.5, 1,
2, and 4 were selected. PTAs for achieving an AUC0-24/MIC of ≥610
(Ramos-Martín et al., 2017; Abdul-Aziz et al., 2020) were calculated.
Based on the MIC distributions for MRSA reported by the EUCAST,
CFR was calculated with the following formula (Wei et al., 2021) to
deﬁne the optimal dosage regimens attaining the AUC0-24/MIC
target of 610:
CFR  
n
i1PTA MICi
(
) · p MICi
(
)
(4)
where PTA(MICi) is the PTA value at the ith MIC category of
MRSA, and p (MICi) is the fraction of isolates of MRSA at this MIC
category.
A dosing regimen resulting in an AUC0-24/MIC value of ≥610, a
PTA value of ≥90%, a Cmin value of 15–30 mg/L in non-complicated
MRSA infectious patients was considered to be the optimal regimen.
The regimen that achieved ≥90% CFR was considered the optimal
empirical therapy, while a CFR between 80% and 90% was associated
with a moderate probability of success (Bradley et al., 2003).
3 Results

The GOF plots for the ﬁnal model illustrated that PRED and
IPRED were in good accordance with the observed concentrations
(Figure 1). The CWRES showed good scattering, with all points
between ±4. The ﬁnal model demonstrated strong stability, with
923 out of 1,000 bootstrap runs ﬁtting successfully, and the
parameter
estimates
were
similar
to
the
bootstrap
median
estimates meanwhile were within the 95% percentile interval (PI)
of the bootstrap simulation results (Table 2). The pc-VPC results
conﬁrmed a sufﬁcient predictive power of the ﬁnal teicoplanin
model, with the observed data included in the range of 95% CI
and the median and 95% CI lines of the observations located near the
middle of the 1,000 simulation results (Figure 2).
3.4 Monte Carlo simulation
Table 3 demonstrates the median and variability of the Cmin and
AUC0-24/MIC simulation results achieved with the various dosage
regimens. Only the AUC0-24/MIC and recommended regimens
when MIC = 1 are presented in Table 3 since the results are
applicable to most cases with MIC ≤1, and AUC0-24/MIC at
other MIC levels can be calculated accordingly. As expected,
teicoplanin
Cmin
and
exposure
generally
increased
with
increasing dosage and decreasing renal function. As seen in the
table, the results of loading dosage regimens were mainly reﬂected in
Cmin, 72h, while the results of the maintenance dosage regimens were
mainly reﬂected in Cmin,
240h and AUC0-24/MIC. Taking the
simulated patients with a GFR of 120 mL/min/1.73 m2 as an
example, though the simulated Cmin, 72h under the second dosage
regimen was higher than that of the ﬁrst due to the higher frequency
of the loading doses (15 mg/kg q12h*5 vs. 15 mg/kg q12h*3), the
Cmin, 240h and AUC0-24/MIC were less than that due to the lower
maintenance doses [7.5 vs. 15 mg/kg every 24 h (q24h)]. Besides, for
patients with renal insufﬁciency (simulated GFR of 60, 30, 15 mL/
min/1.73 m2), extending the dosing interval seemed more likely to
achieve target PK/PD results than reducing the unit dosage. Based
on the above simulations, for patients with a GFR of 90–120 mL/
min/1.73 m2, the recommended dosing regimen was 15 mg/kg q12h
for 5 times, followed by 15 mg/kg q24h. For patients with a GFR of
30–60 mL/min/1.73 m2, a dosage regimen of 15 mg/kg q12h for
3 times followed by 15 mg/kg on Day 3 and 15 mg/kg q48h from
Day 4 was able to make the teicoplanin Cmin and exposure achieve
the targets. For patients with a GFR of 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, a
regimen of 12 mg/kg q12h for 3 times followed by 12 mg/kg on
Day 3 and 12 mg/kg q72h from Day 4 was enough to make the above
parameters meet the standard (Table 3).
Figure 3 shows the median Cmin, 72h achieved with different
loading dose regimens in subgroups stratiﬁed by GFR. As seen from
the ﬁgure, for the same unit dose, increasing the number of loading
doses may signiﬁcantly elevate teicoplanin trough concentrations at
72 h for a faster attainment of the target (Figures 3A, B). Generally,
lower loading doses were required in patients with lower GFR. For

patients with GFR 90–120 mL/min/1.73 m2, a loading dose of
15 mg/kg for 5 times made it possible to achieve a Cmin, 72h
of ≥15 mg/L; for patients with GFR 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m2, a
loading dosage regimen of 15 mg/kg for 3 times was enough,
while for patients with GFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, the loading
dosage may be reduced to 12 mg/kg for 3 times in patients with
non-complicated infections.
Figure 4 displays the PTA against MRSA associated with the PK/
PD target of efﬁcacy, AUC0-24/MIC ≥610. According to the EUCAST
data, most MRSA had an MIC distribution for teicoplanin of
0.5–1 mg/L. When considering a target of PTA ≥90%, we found
that the conventional dosing regimen of 400 mg (6 mg/kg) or 600 mg
(10 mg/kg) q24h was not adequate for the simulated patients (not
listed in Figure 4). For patients with GFR 90–120 mL/min/1.73 m2,
two regimens with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/kg q24h resulted in
similar PTAs, which were higher than the maintenance dose of
12 mg/kg q24h. Consistent with the trend in Table 3, for patients
with GFR 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the PTAs of the maintenance dose
15 mg/kg q48h regimen was higher than that of the maintenance dose
7.5 mg/kg q24h; the latter was similar to the maintenance dose of
12 mg/kg q48h. For patients with GFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, the PTA
values obtained by the three maintenance schemes of 15 mg/kg q72h,
12 mg/kg q72h, and 5 mg/kg q24h gradually decreased, which also
conﬁrmed that extending the dosing interval might be easier to
achieve the PTA target than reducing the unit dose for patients
with renal insufﬁciency. Generally, for patients with lower GFR, lower
maintenance doses were required to achieve PTA targets. For MRSA
isolates, the vast majority of the listed regimens achieved PTA targets
when MIC = 0.5 mg/L; however, no dosage achieved 90% of PTA
when MIC = 1 mg/L (Figure 4).
As shown in Figure 5, the simulated dosing regimens of
15 mg/kg q24h in patients with a GFR of 90 mL/min/1.73 m2,
15 mg/kg q48h in patients with a GFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m2,
and 15 mg/kg q72h in patients with a GFR of 15 mL/min/1.73 m2
almost achieved CFR values of ≥80% for the target of AUC0-24/
MIC ≥610. However, none of the simulated dosing regimens could
make CFR values exceed 90%. For the same simulated regimen, the
lower GFR level of patients might result in higher CFR values.
4 Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst PPK model of teicoplanin in
ICU adult patients with sepsis established by prospective blood
collection data covering the absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion phases. Monte Carlo simulation based on PK/PD
theory rationalized and optimized dosing regimens for teicoplanin
in septic patients with different renal function levels, which partially
ﬁlled the gap in teicoplanin instructions, as the instruction does not
have a dosage recommendation for patients with sepsis (EMA.,
2022).
The ﬁnal model was a two-compartment model with GFR as the
only covariate signiﬁcantly affecting teicoplanin CL. The ﬁnal model
parameter estimates for CL, V1, Q, and V2 were 1.03 L/h, 20.1 L,
3.12 L/h, and 101 L, respectively. The present model was similar to
the previously published model by Wi et al. (Wi et al., 2017) in the
typical value of CL (1.03 vs. 0.95 L/h), although the distribution was
larger (20.1 L vs. 15.7 L in V1; 101 L vs. 71.7 L in V2). This difference
was expected, since factors such as endothelial damage, increased
capillary permeability, compounded by a large amount of ﬂuid

collections in various body cavities in septic patients might increase
the distribution volume (Fujii et al., 2020; de Cacqueray et al., 2022).
Covariate analysis in this study demonstrated that GFR calculated by
the CKD-EPI equation (Levey et al., 2009) was the only signiﬁcant
covariate affecting teicoplanin PK, which is similar to the previous
study (Cazaubon et al., 2017) and consistent with the fact that
teicoplanin is mainly eliminated unchanged by the kidney (Falcoz
et al., 1987). Several studies revealed creatinine clearance and weight
as signiﬁcant covariates inﬂuencing teicoplanin elimination (Byrne
et al., 2017; Byrne et al., 2018; Kontou et al., 2020); however, weight
in this study population did not seem to have a signiﬁcant effect on
teicoplanin, which was consistent with previous PPK studies from
Lortholary et al. (Lortholary et al., 1996) and Cazaubon et al.
(Cazaubon et al., 2017). A good stability and accuracy of the
ﬁnal model were conﬁrmed by GOF, bootstrap, and pc-VPC
estimates.
Considering the high plasma protein binding rate (about 90%)
and extremely long elimination half-life of teicoplanin, a loading
regimen is recommended to achieve target Cmin rapidly during
treatment (Pea et al., 2003; Yoon et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015),
which is crucial in the treatment of severe infections, especially in
critically ill patients (Kollef, 2001; Niederman, 2003; Kollef, 2013).
According
to
teicoplanin
instruction
(EMA.,
2022),
the
recommended
loading
dosage
depends
on
the
indication:
12 mg/kg q12h for 3 to 5 administrations for bone and joint
infections
and
endocarditis,
while
6 mg/kg
q12h
for
3 administrations for other infections. However, a study by
Cazaubon et al. (Cazaubon et al., 2017) revealed that a loading
dose regimen with 5 administrations of either 400 (approximately
6 mg/kg) or 600 mg (approximately 9 mg/kg) was not sufﬁcient to
achieve the target Cmin, 72h ≥ 15 mg/L in most patients, and at least
800 mg (approximately 12 mg/kg) should be used to achieve this
target with a PTA ≥90%. This ﬁnding was in agreement with
previous research (Brink et al., 2008; Kato et al., 2016; Nakano
et al., 2016). Similar conclusions were obtained in this study in septic
patients, suggesting that at least 800 mg (about 12 mg/kg) is required
to achieve the target of Cmin, 72h ≥ 15 mg/L regardless of patients’
renal function (Figure 3). Besides, the present study revealed that
increasing the dosing frequency was even more likely to enhance
teicoplanin trough concentrations at 72 h than increasing unit doses
(take the Cmin, 72h of 10 mg/kg for 5 administrations compared to
12 mg/kg for 3 administrations in Figure 3A as an example).
Higher loading doses can provide higher drug exposure at the
start of treatment, but the difference appears to diminish after
14 days when different loading doses are followed by the same
maintenance dose, therefore, a sufﬁcient maintenance dose seems
important (Ahn et al., 2011). Maintenance dose is mainly reﬂected in
Cmin, 240h and AUC0-24/MIC, according to our simulation, at low
maintenance doses such as 5 mg/kg or 7.5 mg/kg, neither Cmin, 240h
nor AUC0-24/MIC could reach the target (GFR 90 and 120 mL/min/
1.73 m2, maintenance dose 7.5 mg/kg q24h, Table 3); even when
Cmin, 240h exceeded the target value, AUC0-24/MIC still could not
meet the standard (GFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, maintenance dose
7.5 mg/kg q24h; GFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, maintenance dose
5 mg/kg q24h, Table 3). Additionally, our data found that for
renal insufﬁcient patients, extending the dosing interval was
more likely to bring the AUC0-24/MIC to the target than
reducing the unit dose, though the concentrations obtained by
both methods may be similar (GFR 15, 30, and 60 mL/min/
1.73 m2, Table 3). The reason may be that the PK/PD index for
FIGURE 3

teicoplanin was AUC for 0–24 h, while extending the dosing interval
mainly affects teicoplanin exposure during the elimination phase,
hence the effect on AUC0-24 is not as intuitive as the effect of
reducing the unit dose. This provides some new information, as in
teicoplanin instruction (EMA., 2022), both decreasing unit dose or
prolonging dosage interval are recommended for renal insufﬁcient
patients, but whether the two methods may cause a difference in
teicoplanin 0–24 h exposure is not mentioned. Our ﬁnding
is consistent with the review by Gilbert (Gilbert et al., 2009), in
which extending the dosing interval was the only recommendation
for teicoplanin administration in patients with renal failure.
The ﬁndings also suggested that for teicoplanin, AUC0-24/MIC
may
be
a
more
sensitive
PK/PD
indicator
than
trough
concentration.
Though Cmin is a common index for glycopeptide TDM and dose
optimization, it does not take bacterial susceptibility into account,
which is considered to affect the clinical outcome (Lodise et al., 2008).
Therefore, in this study, we also calculated the AUC0-24/MIC, PTA,
and CFR as targets based on evidence suggesting that these indicators
were associated with both bacteriological efﬁcacy and prevention
of drug resistance (Rose et al., 2008; Matsumoto et al., 2016). Since
Cmin,
72h, which is recommended as a surrogate measure for
teicoplanin TDM, is correlated with loading dosage, whereas
AUC0-24/MIC is more closely related to maintenance dosage, the
optimal dosing regimens obtained by the above two indicators were
slightly inconsistent, but the overall difference was not signiﬁcant
(Table 3). The simulation results showed that the PTA was above
90% for most of the simulated dosages against MRSA with an MIC of

0.5 mg/L; however, it decreased to 33.1%–74.4% at an MIC of 1 mg/L
in patients with varying renal function with the index of AUC0-24/
MIC ≥610, and no simulated regimen was able to get the PTA to the
90% target (Figure 4). In addition, CFR results showed the
teicoplanin unit dose of 15 mg/kg q24h in patients with GFR
90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 15 mg/kg q48h in patients with GFR 30 mL/
min/1.73 m2, and 15 mg/kg q72h in patients with GFR 15 mL/min/
1.73 m2 allowed patients to achieve an acceptable CFR of nearly 80%;
similarly, none of the simulated regimens could bring the CFR to 90%
target (Figure 5).
Compared to Cmin, AUC-guided dosing is preferable if
conditions permit (Hanai et al., 2022), since AUC0-24/MIC is the
recommended PK/PD index for such time-dependent antibiotics
with long PAEs and responds to the overall exposure of teicoplanin.
However, due to obstacles such as lack of practitioner familiarity,
time allocation and training requirements, AUC-based dosing is
unavailable in many clinical settings, in this case, Cmin may be
recommended as a surrogate marker (Zhang et al., 2020). Therefore,
the two indexes of Cmin and AUC0-24/MIC were both included in
this study, and the results of each index were reported, for the
selection and reference of clinical practitioners according to their
own conditions. Though Cmin,72h on Day 4 before reaching steady
state is recommended as a surrogate measure for teicoplanin TDM,
the value is mainly an evaluation of the loading dose for the initial
3 days, therefore follow-up TDM such as Cmin, 240h is suggested to be
conducted to evaluate the maintenance dose (Hanai et al., 2022).
Taken together, optimal dosage regimens based on both Cmin and
AUC0-24/MIC targets in this study are recommended in order to
achieve
both microorganism-nonspeciﬁc
and microorganism-
speciﬁc targets, which are 5 loading doses of 15 mg/kg (equates
to approximately 1,000 mg) q12h followed by a maintenance dose of
15 mg/kg q24h for patients with a GFR of 90–120 mL/min/1.73 m2;
3 loading doses of 15 mg/kg (equates to approximately 1,000 mg)
q12h followed by a maintenance dose of 15 mg/kg on Day 3 and
15 mg/kg q48h from Day 4 for patients with a GFR of 30–60 mL/
min/1.73 m2, and 3 loading doses of 12 mg/kg (equates to
approximately 800 mg) q12h followed by a maintenance dose of
12 mg/kg on Day 3 and 12 mg/kg q72h from Day 4 for patients with
a GFR of 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Table 3). In addition, since the PTA
and CFR results obtained from the simulated regimen in this study
were not very satisfactory, the clinical efﬁcacy of the recommended
regimen should be veriﬁed by further real-world studies.

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst PPK model developed for
teicoplanin in ICU adult patients with sepsis. Dosing regimens were
optimized by four targets, including Cmin, AUC0-24/MIC, PTA and
CFR, making it possible to compare the results directly from the above
targets widely adopted in dose optimization and to understand the
differences between them. The priority of the indicators and the
limitation of Cmin,72h as a surrogate metric were also discussed.
Monte Carlo simulations provided new information to the dose
optimization strategy of patients with renal failure, indicating that
AUC0-24/MIC targets are more likely to be achieved by extending
the dosing interval than by reducing the unit dose. Finally, based on the
above simulation results, this study proposed a dose selection scheme of
teicoplanin for septic patients with different renal functions taking into
account both Cmin and AUC0-24/MIC targets.
This study has several limitations. First, the analysis was based on
data obtained from ICU septic patients, therefore, the conclusions may
not necessarily apply to other patient populations. Besides, we adopted
putative MIC values in the simulations since individual MIC values
were not available. Finally, considering that the PTA and CFR results of
the simulated dose schemes were not perfect, clinical studies are
necessary to assess the safety and clinical utility of teicoplanin doses
higher than currently recommended.
5 Conclusion
In conclusion, we successfully developed a PPK model for
teicoplanin based on a prospective cohort of Chinese septic
patients. Model-based simulations suggest that the current
standard protocol may result in undertherapeutic Cmin and
AUC, and a single dose of at least 12 mg/kg is required.
Regarding patients with renal insufﬁciency, prolonging the
dosing
interval
rather
than
reducing
the
unit
dose
is
recommended to achieve the target AUC0-24/MIC. Though
trough concentration on Day 4 is the widely used TDM
indicator for teicoplanin, it is recommended that follow-up
steady-state trough concentration should be considered to
reﬂect the maintenance dose of teicoplanin treatment.
