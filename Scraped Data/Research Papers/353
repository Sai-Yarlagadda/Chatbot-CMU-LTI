Abstract. Background/Aim: Claudin-10 (CLDN10) is a
membrane integral protein. It is one of the widely expressed
tight junctional claudins with functions not well defined. In the
present study, the expression profile and its role in cerebral
endothelial cells and in the interaction between breast cancer
and endothelial cells were investigated. Materials and Methods:
CLDN10 expression was examined in a wide range of cell
types. Brain endothelial cell models with or without CLDN10
expression were generated using the hCMEC/D3 cell line and
used to test the barrier and permeability functions. Trans-
endothelial drug delivery and invasion were also evaluated.
Results: hCMEC/D3 cells express high levels of CLDN10,
compared with peripheral endothelial cells, mesothelial cells,
fibroblasts, and breast cancer cells, which were either negative
or expressed low levels of CLDN10. Knockdown of CLDN10 in
hCMEC/D3 cells resulted in impaired tight junctions as seen by
reduced transendothelial electric resistance and paracellular
permeability. It also accelerated invasion of breast cancer cells
through the endothelial cell layer. CLDN10 knockdown in
hCMEC/D3 cells led to an increase in transendothelial
chemodrug delivery. Furthermore, the SRC kinase inhibitor
(AZM475271) was able to decrease the impedance and increase
the paracellular permeability in cerebral endothelial cells.
Conclusion: Cerebral endothelial cells express high levels of
CLDN10, a protein regulating barrier function and thereby
drug permeability and cancer invasiveness in brain endothelial
cells, suggesting that it is a novel therapeutic target for the
treatment of brain metastasis-related diseases.
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of brain
microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), astrocytes,
pericytes, and many intercellular molecular structures (1, 2).
Tight junctions (TJs) between BMECs construct a robust
physical barrier preventing the free exchange of substances
between the bloodstream and the brain parenchyma and
migration of tumor cells (3-7). Patients with brain metastases
have poor clinical outcomes. However, there are marked
improvement of the clinical course and patient’s outcome as
a result of improved local and systemic therapies and
advanced imaging technologies allowing early diagnosis (8).
The blood-brain barrier can also block the entry of drugs into
metastatic lesions, especially antibody-based drugs (9). Once
breast cancer patients have brain metastases, their quality of
life and survival time are seriously affected. The median
survival time of breast cancer patients with brain metastases
in the United States is only 10 months (10). Therefore, it is
essential to understand the molecular mechanisms of the
BBB, as it can help us understand the process of breast
cancer brain metastasis and develop more targeted therapies.
The TJs are formed by the interaction of transmembrane
proteins, such as occludin and claudins, and cytoplasmic
scaffolding proteins, such as zonula occludens and cingulin.

These proteins work together to regulate the permeability of the
BBB (1, 11). However, what makes these highly specialized
BBB-TJs extremely restrictive remains unknown. Many studies
have demonstrated that CLDNs are the major proteins involved
in TJs and are essential for maintaining the BBB structure (12,
13). We have reported that Claudin-5 (CLDN5), a member of
this superfamily that plays a key role in TJ formation, is
involved in the barrier function of ECs (14). Nevertheless,
previous studies have shown that a single claudin subtype, such
as claudin-5, is insufficient for completing TJ formation at the
BBB (15). Therefore, it is of interest to identify other proteins
involved in TJ formation at the BBB.
It has been reported that claudin-10 is highly expressed in
mouse brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs), but not in
non-BCECs (16). However, the protein levels and localization
of CLDN10 in BCECs have not yet been described. Although
CLDN10 has been found in many human epithelial and
endothelial cells (17), such as kidney and uterus cells (18), its
mRNA and protein expression and localization in human BBB
have not been reported. Equally important, it has been
reported that CLDN10 is involved in TJ strands (17). Previous
studies have shown that claudin-10 not only regulates
paracellular ion selectivity, but also plays a role in certain ion
channels (18). However, some questions remain unanswered,
such as: How is CLDN10 expressed in the human blood-brain
barrier? What is the function of CLDN10 in TJs? How does
it affect the invasion of breast cancer cells into the brain and
trans-endothelial drug delivery? 
In the present study, we first explored the expression
levels of CLDN10 in brain endothelial cells, common
vascular endothelial cells, mesothelial cells, fibroblasts, and
breast cancer cells. We found that CLDN10 is highly
expressed only in brain endothelial cells and involved in the
formation of TJs. We then generated cell models of brain
endothelial cells with altered levels of CLDN10 expression.
Using these cell models, we studied the roles of CLDN10 in
the function of TJs in brain endothelial cells and
transendothelial invasion of breast cancer cells, as well as
the effect of CLDN10 knockdown in brain endothelial cells
on the trans-endothelial drug delivery. Furthermore, we
examined the potential role of a SRC kinase in the junctional
functions of cerebral endothelial cells, aided by the cell
models with differential CLDN10 expression.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell transfection. In this study, three immortalized
human brain endothelial cell lines, hCMEC/D3 (kind gift from Dr
Guilaume, Flury of Institut COCHIN, Paris, France), TY9, and
TY10 (kindly gifted by Dr Yasuteru Sano of Department of
Neurology and Clinical Neuroscience, Yamaguchi University
Graduate School of Medicine, Yamaguchi, Japan) were cultured in
endothelial 
cell 
(EC) 
growth 
medium 
(EBM-2 
medium
supplemented with EGM-2 MV, 5% foetal calf serum (FCS)
(Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK), and 1% antibiotics (Sigma-Aldrich). 
Three vascular endothelial cell lines namely human vascular
endothelial cells (HECV) (ICLC, Genova, Italy), primary cultured
human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HuVEC), and human
microvascular endothelial cells (HmVEC) (Life Technologies, Paisley,
UK) were used. HECV were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM)/F12 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FCS
and 1% antibiotics; HmVEC cells were maintained in Medium 131
supplemented with Microvascular Growth Supplement (MVGS) in
flasks treated with Attachment Factor Protein (Life Technologies);
HuVEC cells were obtained from human umbilical vein and cultured
in M199 containing 20%-30% FCS.
The human immortalized mesothelial cells MET5A (ATCC,
Manassas, VA, USA) and a human foetal lung fibroblast cell line
(MRC5) (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Salisbury,
UK) were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FCS and
1% antibiotics. Five human breast cancer cells lines, MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-361, BT474, HCC1419, and MCF-7 (European
Collection of Animal Cell Cultures) were cultured in DMEM/F12
supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% antibiotics.
hCMEC/D3 cells were transfected with CLDN10 siRNA or
control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA, USA)
following the manufacturer’s protocol in order to establish
CLDN10-manipulated cell models. After incubation for the
indicated time, cells were harvested for expression analysis and
further experiments.
All the cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37˚C, 5%
CO2, and 95% humidity except TY9 and TY10 cells that were
cultured at 34˚C.
Key reagents. The fluorescence dye, DiI (1,10-Dioctadecyl-
3,3,30,30Tetramethylindocarbocyanine Perchlorate), was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. A small molecule inhibitor to human SRC,
namely AZM475271 was from Tocris (Bristol, UK). Cell Counting
Kit-8 was from NBS Biologicals (Huntingdon, UK). Cisplatin was
from Tocris Cookson Ltd.; Neratinib (Puma Biotechnologies, Los
Angeles, CA, USA). Antibodies to CLDN10 (sc-373700) and a
housekeeping protein anti-GAPDH antibodies were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies Inc.
Extraction of RNA from cells and PCR analysis of gene transcripts.
Total RNA was extracted using the TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich).
Reverse transcription of the RNA was then performed using a
reverse transcription kit from Promega (Southampton, UK). For
conventional PCR, GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega) was applied
using primers for CLDN10 and GAPDH. Quantitative analysis of
gene transcripts was conducted using a StepOne Plus thermocycler
from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK). The
primers used in the study are listed in Table I and a FAM tagged
Uniprimer™ and reverse primer with a unique z-sequence were used.
GAPDH was used as a housekeeping control to normalize the data.
Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested, lysed in a RIPA lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% (v/v) NP-40, 0.5%
(w/v) Sodium Deoxycholate, 1.0 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS and
0.01% (w/v) sodium azide, pH of 7.4), and proteins were separated
using SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to an
Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Merck Millipore, Hertfordshire, UK)
for further analysis. After blocking with a skimmed milk mixture, the
membrane was incubated overnight with the appropriate primary

antibody, washed, and incubated with the secondary antibody
conjugated with HRP. The proteins were visualized using the EZ-ECL
solution (Geneflow Ltd., Litchfield, UK), and images were captured
using a G-BOX detection system (Syngene, Cambridge, UK).
Dynamic monitoring of TJ of human brain endothelial cell
(hCMEC/D3) layer and tumour- human brain endothelial cell
(hCMEC/D3) layer interactions by ECIS. Electric cell-substrate
impedance sensing (ECIS) can be used to investigate the formation
and dynamics of epithelial TJs. ECIS can provide a continuous
measurement of cell growth and changes in cell behaviour,
including the formation and disassembly of TJs, by monitoring the
impedance of cells growing on a substrate with electrodes (Applied
Biophysics Inc., Troy, NJ, USA). 
The assay was performed as previously described with
modifications (19). Briefly, ECIS arrays (96W1E) (Applied
Biophysics Inc.) were first activated, stabilized, and cleaned; 7×104
hCMEC/D3 cells were seeded in ECIS arrays and incubated for 24
h to reach confluence before the ECIS arrays were placed in the
incubated array station. The resistance/impedance were measured
over the course of the experiment. In selected wells, an appropriate
concentration of SRCi (AZM475271) was added into medium, and
changes in impedance were measured and analysed to assess the
dynamics of TJ disassembly.
ECIS was also used to monitor interactions of breast cancer and
endothelial cells. 7×104 hCMEC/D3 control cells, or hCMEC/
D3CLDN10-KD were plated in the ECIS array and incubated for 24 h
to reach confluence. Breast cancer cells were then added to the
endothelium and migration of breast cancer cells was automatically
tracked and recorded.
Trans-endothelial resistance (TER). TER was measured using an
EVOM voltohmmeter (EVOL, World Precision Instruments, Aston,
Herts, UK) and a pair of STX-2 chopstick electrodes (WPI,
Sarasota, FL, USA). The resistance was measured with a
voltohmmeter after electrodes were placed in the upper and lower
chambers. hCMEC/D3 cells were seeded into the 0.4 mm pore size
insert (upper chamber) and allowed to reach full confluence for
further experiments. The TER of inserts with hCMEC/D3Control
cells, or hCMEC/D3CLDN10-KD cells was then examined. 
Paracellular permeability (PCP). PCP was determined using
fluorescently labeled dextran FITC-Dextran-40, molecular weight
being 40 kDa, as we previously reported (20). hCMEC/D3 cells
were seeded into the 0.4 μm pore size insert (upper chamber) and
allowed to reach full confluence for further experiments. With or
without SRCi (AZM475271), Dextran-40 alone or in combination
with breast cells was added to the upper chamber. Then the medium
from the lower chamber was collected at the indicated time. The
fluorescence from these collections was read on a multichannel
fluorescence reader (Promega).
Transendothelial invasion of breast cancer cells assay. Trans-well
chambers equipped with 6.5 mm diameter polycarbonate filter (pore
size 8 μm) (Becton Dickinson Labware, Oxford, UK) were pre-
coated with Collagen (Type I solution from rat tail) from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Then, hCMEC/D3 cells were seeded
and left to reach confluency. Following this, 30,000 breast cancer
cells previously labeled with DiI (Tetramethylindocarbocyanine
Perchlorate) were aliquoted into each insert. After 96 h co-culture,
non-invasive cells are removed from the inner chamber with a
cotton swab. The breast cancer cells passing through the insert were
fixed (4% formalin) and counted using fluorescent microscopy.
Trans-endothelial drug delivery. hCMEC/D3 cells with or without
CLDN10 knockdown were seeded into the 0.4 μm pore size inserts
(upper chamber) and allowed to reach full confluence. Meanwhile,
1×105 breast cancer cells were seeded to each well of a 24-well
plate and incubated overnight. Then inserts were transferred to the
24-well plate and indicated concentrations of antitumor agents were
added. After 96 h co-culture, the breast cancer cells were fixed with
4% formalin and stained with crystal violet solution. The cells were
then counted using microscopy.
Immunofluorescence (IFC). Cells were seeded in a chamber slide to
reach confluence. They were then fixed with ice cold pure ethanol
for overnight. After rehydration with PBC, cells were first
permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X100 for 5 min, followed by
washing and blocking with 10% horse serum. Anti-CLDN10
antibody (1:200 dilution) was added and the slide kept in dark on a
rocking platform for 2 h. Following washing, FITC-conjugated
secondary antibody (1:1,000 dilution) together with DAPI (4’,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole) (1:1,000, as a nucleus counter stain) was
added to the cells for a further 2 h. The slides were mounted with
FluoSave for photographing. 
Statistical analysis. Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS)
27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), as well as GraphPad Prism
6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) were used to conduct
the statistical analyses. Statistical significance was determined using
Student’s t-test or Anova test, where appropriate. p<0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Results
The expression of CLDN10 is relatively high in brain
endothelial cells. Claudins (Cldns) are the pivotal
transmembrane proteins that establish paracellular tightness
between neighboring endothelial and epithelial cells (21).
Members of this family have been described to play a vital role
in BBB to resist the brain metastasis of tumour cells (5, 7, 15).
However, few studies discuss whether CLDN10 (claudin-10),
as a member of the claudins family, plays a role in breast
cancer brain metastasis.
To investigate whether CLDN10 is involved in the process
of breast cancer cell invasion through the blood-brain barrier,
we first examined the expression of CLDN10 in brain
endothelial cells and breast cancer cells using PCR; MET5A
non-cancerous mesothelial cells and MRC5 fibroblasts were
used for comparison (Figure 1A). We found that the
CLDN10 transcript was relatively highly expressed in brain
endothelial cells, while its expression was very low in breast
cancer cells, and undetectable in other types of cells (Figure
1A). On the protein level, we found relatively high
expression levels of CLDN10 in brain endothelial cells
hCMEC/D3 cells, but it was not detected in other cells
(Figure 1B). This indicates that CLDN10 expression is
relatively high in brain endothelial cells, but very low in
breast cancer cells. We then used immunofluorescent staining
(IFC) to determine the cellular localization of CLDN10 in
hCMEC/D3 cells and found that CLDN10 staining was

hCMEC/D3 cells (Figure 1C), in line with the location of
tight junction in these cells. 
The generation of cell models with altered levels of CLDN10.
Brain endothelial cells are an important components of the
blood-brain barrier, and the claudin protein family in brain
endothelial cells plays an important role in the strength of
the blood-brain barrier, which can seriously affect substance
diffusion (e.g. drug delivery) and brain metastasis of tumours
including breast cancer (4, 22, 23). However, the role of
CLDN10 in TJs of the blood brain barrier and brain
metastasis of breast cancer has not been reported. To further
explore the role of CLDN10 in TJs of brain endothelial cells,
a key component of the blood brain barrier (BBB), and the
potential impact of CLDN10 on brain metastases in breast
cancer, we generated cell models by manipulating CLDN10
expression levels in brain endothelial cells to explore
tumour-brain endothelial cell interactions in vitro. Brain
endothelial hCMEC/D3 cells were used to generate CLDN10
knockdown cell models because of their relatively higher
CLDN10 expression. As demonstrated in Figure 2A,
CLDN10 expression of these cells showed a clear decrease
following transfection, as detected by both quantitative PCR
and IFC (Figure 2B). Additionally, in order to verify whether
CLDN10 gene expression level affects the proliferation of
hCMEC/D3 cells, we performed a CCK-8 proliferation assay
and found that reduction in the levels of CLDN10 did not
affect hCMEC/D3 cell proliferation (Figure 2C).  
Effect of reduction in CLDN10 expression on transendothelial
resistance (TER) of brain endothelial cells. The BBB is a
diffusion barrier that selectively excludes most blood-derived
substances and cells from entering the brain. TER
measurement is a reliable parameter characterizing the
integrity of BBB (24). In order to examine the effect of
CLDN10 changes on the barrier integrity between brain
endothelial cells, we established the brain endothelial cell

using CLDN10 knockdown
hCMEC/D3 and the parental hCMEC/D3 cell line that
expresses high levels of CLDN10. The TER of CLDN10KD
hCMEC/D3 brain endothelial cell barrier was decreased
(Figure 3A). We further examined TER changes following
coculture of brain endothelial cells with three different breast
cancer cell lines. As shown in Figure 3B–D, after the addition
of tumour cells TER showed a downward trend, which may
be related to the destruction of BBB by tumour cells.
Effect of CLDN10 down-regulation on PCP between brain
endothelial cells. Paracellular permeability (PCP) of BBB is
governed by TJs between brain endothelial cells (20); as
another assessment method of TJ function, its aberration of
which is linked to substance transport from the blood to the
brain and is also explored as means to enhance brain drug
delivery (1, 3). In order to determine whether paracellular
permeability of the brain endothelial cell barrier is altered in
the presence of reduced CLDN10 levels the PCP was
measured. The result showed that permeability in
hCMEC/D3CLDN10-KD cell 
is 
higher 
than 
that 
of
hCMEC/D3Control cells over a 2 h period, indicating changes
in PCP between brain endothelial cells (Figure 4A). Addition
of three breast cancer cell lines had differential effects on
permeability over a 4 h period: addition of MCF7 cells
reduced the permeability over 2 h; whereas BT-474 cells had
no effect. It is interesting to note that addition of MDA-MB-
231 cells led to a contrasting trend to that seen with MCF-7
cells (Figure 4B-D). This could imply that adding different
breast cancer cells into the brain endothelial cell model has
differential effects on PCP.
Effects of CLDN10 down-regulation on barrier functions of
brain endothelial cells assessed by ECIS. ECIS was further
employed to evaluate TJ function of brain endothelial cells in
order to evaluate if barrier functions simulating the BBB using
the hCMEC/D3 cell model. hCMEC/D3 cells were first
allowed to grow to confluence on the gold-plated electrodes.
Upon the formation of cell monolayer in the well overnight,
the resistance (or impedance) of the system was measured.
The rate of resistance represents the sealing and permeability
properties of the brain endothelial cell barrier. Impedance in
hCMEC/D3CLDN10-KD
cells was lower than that in
hCMEC/D3Control cells (Figure 5A). The addition of three
different types of breast cancer cells to the brain endothelial
barrier model in ECIS caused a slight decrease in resistance

at first, but resistance increased over time, and the resistance
level of the hCMEC/D3Control cells remained higher than that
of the hCMEC/D3CLDN10-KD cells (Figure 5B-D). 
Effect of CLDN10 knockdown in hCMEC/D3 cells on the
invasion of breast cancer cells through a human brain
endothelial cell (hCMEC/D3) monolayer. The blood–brain
barrier (BBB) protects the brain from pathogens and cancer
cells. The effect of CLDN10 knockdown in hCMEC/D3 cells
on the invasive potential of breast cancer cells was assessed
using an in vitro invasion model composed of a semi-
permeable membrane layered with basement membrane and
brain endothelial cells with or without CLDN10 knockdown.
As seen in Figure 6, invasion of all three breast cancer cell
lines was significantly increased due to CLDN10 knockdown
in the brain endothelial cells hCMEC/D3 (Figure 6). 
Effect of CLDN10 alteration in hCMEC/D3 cells on drug
trans-endothelial permeability. To investigate the effects of
CLDN10 knock-down in the BBB on the delivery of
chemotherapy and targeted drugs across the brain endothelial
cell barrier, we evaluated a number of chemotherapeutics. We
modified the transwell assay to assess differences in killing
cancer cells after chemotherapy and targeted drugs passed
through the brain endothelial cell barrier to determine the
effect of CLDN10 knockdown on drug trans-endothelial
barrier delivery. Cisplatin and the targeted drug Neratinib that
passes through the hCMEC/D3CLDN10-KD cell layer were
found to increase the death rate of breast cancer cells, as it
was evident by decreased cell number after drug treatment,
implying that an increased amounts of the therapeutics were
able to cross the blood-brain barrier (Figure 7A-D).
CLDN10 is closely related to ZO-1 in forming TJs, which is
regulated by the SRC Pathway in hCMEC/D3. A functional TJ
requires the interactions between the membrane integral TJ
proteins (claudins and occluding), the subcoat scaffolding
proteins (Zonula Occludens, ZOs) and the cytoskeleton.
Claudin association with actin dependents on ZO-1, but
colocalization demonstrates intermittent rather than continuous
association between claudin, ZO-1, and actin (25). To
determine whether inhibiting CLDN10 had an impact on ZO-

level of ZO-1 decreased. Additionally, we found a slight
decline in the expression of SRC, a known key signaling

Discussion
This study reports for the first time the differential
expression of CLDN-10 among human brain endothelial
cells, vascular endothelial cells, mesothelial cells, fibroblasts,
and breast cancer cells. We observed that CLDN-10 is highly
expressed in brain endothelial cells and is involved in the
formation of TJ strands between brain endothelial cells. Its
expression level affects the function of the brain endothelial

hCMEC/D3CLDN10-KD cell layer. The images were taken with a Nikon

barrier-TJ and correspondingly, the transendothelial invasion
of breast cancer cells and drug delivery. This study also
revealed for the first time that ZO-1 gene expression is
decreased upon CLDN10 knock down in brain endothelial
cells; meanwhile, the TJ function of the brain endothelial cell
barrier was more vulnerable to being altered by a SRC
kinase inhibitor.
Claudins are the main proteins forming the backbone of
TJ and important determinants of paracellular "tightness"
between adjacent brain endothelial cells (6, 26). Previous
research suggests that claudin-5 (CLDN-5) is the dominant
TJ protein at the BBB, with minor contributions from
CLDN3 and -12, as well as occluding (27). However, the
BBB appears ultrastructurally normal in CLDN5 knock-out
mice, which suggests that additional claudins and/or TJ-
associated marvel proteins (TAMPs) may be involved (27).
In this study, we report that CLDN10 was highly expressed
in three immortalized human brain capillary cell lines, which
is consistent with Ohtsuki’s report that claudin-10 is highly
expressed in mouse brain capillary endothelial cells (16). It
has been recognized in recent years that 27 members of the
claudin family exhibit tissue-specific expression, resulting in
different barrier properties in different tissues (5, 6, 28, 29).
Previous studies have also reported that CLDN10 is
expressed in epithelial cells in organs such as the kidney and
uterus and is associated with TJs between epithelia (18, 30,
31). However, we did not observe its expression in vascular
endothelial cells, mesothelial cells, and fibroblasts.
Furthermore, we detected the very low levels of CLDN10 in
breast cancer cells that were prone to brain metastasis. In
summary, CLDN10 is differentially expressed in different
vascular endothelial cells and different tumor cells.
To investigate the role of CLDN-10 in BBB TJs, we used
immunohistochemistry to determine its distribution and
discovered that it is involved in TJ strands, which is
consistent with other reports (18, 30). To further study the
role of CLDN10 in brain endothelial cell barrier-TJ, we
generated cell models that express decreased levels of
CLDN10 expression compared to controls. To monitor the
impact of CLDN10 down-regulation on the sealing and
permeability properties of brain endothelial cell barrier -TJ,
we performed TER, ECIS (measuring the barrier function
between brain endothelial cells), and PCP assays. Knocking
down CLDN10 in brain endothelial cells dramatically
reduced transendothelial barrier resistance. The changes in
TER and ECIS indicated that CLDN10 plays an important
role in the integrity and sealing properties of brain endothelial
cell barrier. The changes in PCP indicated that CLDN10 plays
a regulatory role in the permeability of the brain endothelial
cell barrier. Furthermore, it is critical that the TJs of the
blood-brain barrier strictly limit the entry of tumor cells and
drugs into the brain. In order to evaluate the impact of

CLDN10 down-regulation on trans-endothelial drug delivery
and breast cancer cell invasion, we designed experiments in
which chemotherapy and targeted drugs penetrate through the
endothelial barrier and kill breast cancer cells. It was
discovered that CLDN10 knockdown improved the ability of
chemotherapy and targeted drugs to kill breast cancer cells
after crossing the endothelial barrier. In addition, breast
cancer cell transendothelial invasion assays showed that
knockdown of CLDN10 in hCMEC/D3 cells also facilitated
transendothelial invasion by breast cancer cells.
The organization and integrity of epithelial TJs depend on
interactions between claudins, ZO scaffolding proteins, and
the cytoskeleton (25). ZO-1 is a TJ protein that interacts with
both occludin and claudins (32, 33). Additionally, ZO-1 is
necessary for claudins to associate with actin. Prot-Bertoye et
al. reported that CLDN10 was colocalized with ZO-1 in the
human kidney cortex (34). However, Anderson et al. reported
that although colocalized, the association between claudin,
ZO-1, and actin is intermittent rather than continuous, and
breaking and reannealing of claudin strands are independent
of ZO-1 or actin interactions in fibroblasts (25).  
A small number of previous studies have also investigated
the association and role of CLDN10, ZO-1 and SRC in brain
endothelial cells. In this study, we found that ZO-1 transcript
levels decreased in CLDN10 knockdown brain endothelial
cells. Junyan et al. report that decreased expression of p-SRC
is associated with increased levels of claudin-5, occludin and
ZO-1 TJ proteins (35). SRC kinase activity appears to be
involved in both TJ assembly and disassembly. However, the
role of SRC kinase in TJ regulation in CLDN10 knockdown
brain endothelial cells is unknown. In this study, we also
examined SRC mRNA levels, and our result showed that
they decreased along with CLDN10 knockdown.
We further assessed the effect of SRC kinases on TJ
function of brain endothelial cells using ECIS detected
resistance and PCP by adding a SRCi. The result showed that
ECIS detected resistance in the hCMEC/D3CLDN10-KD cells
was significantly reduced following inhibition of SRC kinase

inhibited, whereas ECIS detected resistance was moderately
decreased in the hCMEC/D3Control cells. In contrast, in the
hCMEC/D3CLDN10-KD cells, there was a significant elevation
in PCP with the addition of the SRCi, while there was no
significant change in in hCMEC/ D3Control cells. These results
demonstrate that CLDN10 knockdown in hCMEC/D3 cells
suppresses SRC transcript levels, and in return, that TJ
function in hCMEC/D3CLDN10-KD cells becomes more drug
sensitive. 
Conclusion
In conclusion. claudin-10 has a unique pattern of expression
in cerebral endothelial cells. Its high expression in brain
endothelial cells is important in the formation of TJs and the
function of brain endothelial cell barrier. Moreover, CLDN10
expression affects the function of endothelial TJs, which in
turn affects the entry of tumor cells and drugs across the
blood brain barrier. Collectively, CLDN10 is an important
factor in the pathophysiology of the cerebral endothelium and
cancer invasion, and thereby is a favorable therapeutic target.
