Studying complex relaxation behaviors is of critical importance for under-
standing the nature of glasses. Here we report a Kovacs-like memory effect in
glasses, manifested by non-monotonic stress relaxation during two-step high-
to-low strains stimulations. During the stress relaxation process, if the strain
jumps from a higher state to a lower state, the stress does not continue to
decrease, but increases ﬁrst and then decreases. The memory effect becomes
stronger when the atomic motions become highly collective with a large
activation energy, e.g. the strain in the ﬁrst stage is larger, the temperature is
higher, and the stimulation is longer. The physical origin of the stress memory
effect is studied based on the relaxation kinetics and the in-situ synchrotron
X-ray experiments. The stress memory effect is probably a universal phe-
nomenon in different types of glasses.
The nature of glass is one of the most puzzling and challenging pro-
blems in condensed matter physics. One crucial aspect is the complex
relaxation behaviors that arise from nonequilibrium thermodynamics.
When glasses are subjected to external stimulations, e.g. stress or
elevated temperatures, they usually relax monotonically towards
lower energy states1–4. But some anomalous nonmonotonic relaxations
may happen under multi-step annealing, which was observed by
Kovacs in the 1960s5. Since then, the enthalpy/volume rejuvenation
phenomenon after two-step annealing is also known as the Kovacs
memory effect5,6. Such memory effect is revealed to be related to the
heterogeneous nature of glasses7,8, which can be described by phe-
nomenological models such as the Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan
(TNM) model2,6,9–14, and is closely related to the complex relaxation
paths in the deep aging stage15. Thus, studying complex relaxation
behaviors is of vital importance for understanding the non-equilibrium
nature of glasses.
Besides the classical Kovacs memory effect in structural glasses
that are triggered by the multi-step thermal annealing process15–20, the
Kovacs-like memory effect has been widely observed in other complex
disordered systems14,21–26. Multistep mechanic stimulation can trigger
the memory effect in the disordered granular system, crumpled thin
sheets, and elastic foams2,14,18,23,27,28. Multistep thermal and magnetic
stimulations can trigger the memory effect in disordered magnetic
nanoparticles21,29,30. For structural glasses, recent results suggest that
the stress and the thermal effects both contribute similarly to trig-
gering ﬂow31–33. However, the mechanic-ﬁeld-triggered memory effect
has been rarely observed in structural glasses21. It is intriguing to study
whether structural glasses exhibit Kovacs-like memory effect under
multiple strain stimulations.
In this Letter, we report a Kovacs-like memory effect in structural
glasses, which is triggered by the two-step strain-stimulating proce-
dure. This phenomenon is probably universal in glasses as it is

observed in two metallic glasses (MGs) and a polymer glass (Polyvinyl
chloride, PVC) with distinct properties. The inﬂuence of applied
strains, temperatures, and preloading times have been systematically
studied, and the relationship between the memory effect and relaxa-
tion kinetics is unveiled. In-situ high energy X-ray diffraction is applied
to unravel the micro-structure origin of the memory effect.
Results
Figure 1a illustrates the two-step tensile protocol, starting with an initial
strain ε0 = 0. Subsequently, the strain holds at a preloading strain of ε1
for time tw and then jumps to another stress-relaxation strain of ε2.
Figure 1b shows the representative stress relaxation curves for
Ti16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7Cu16.7Ni16.7Be16.7 high-entropy MG with ε1 = 0:5% at a
tested temperature Ta = 593 K. The dynamic characterization is pre-
sented in Supplementary Fig. 1. During the preloading step, the stress
decays monotonically as expected. In the second step, when ε2 > ε1, the
stress continues to decay monotonically. However, when ε2 < ε1, the
stress increases ﬁrst and then decreases after reaching a maximum.
Such a non-monotonic change in stress is analogous to the classical
Kovacs memory effect of enthalpy/volume induced by low- to-high two
temperatures annealing5,34. For the same ε1, a smaller ε2 gives a stronger
stress rejuvenation. The anomalous nonmonotonic evolution in stress,
here named the stress memory effect, is also observed in two other
glasses with distinct chemical compositions, (Fe11Zr1)91.2B8.8 MG and
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), as shown in Fig. 1c. The three representative
glasses cover a wide range of physical properties, e.g., glass transition
temperature, fragility, and yield strength, suggesting that such a stress
memory effect is probably a universal characteristic of glasses.
The inﬂuence of preloading strain ε1 and annealing temperature
on the stress memory effect are summarized in Fig. 2. Figure 2a shows
stress evolution in the second iso-strain stage for different pre-loading
strains ε1. The memory strength Δσ and the peak time tp increase when
the pre-loading strain increases, as shown in Fig. 2a–c. Figure 2d shows
the stress memory effect in the second iso-strain stage at different
temperatures Ta. The peak time tp increases with temperature (see
Fig. 2e). The memory strength Δσ also increases with temperature and
increases faster at higher temperatures, as shown in Fig. 2f. The non-
monotonic normalized stress can be well ﬁtted by double Kohlrausch-
Williams-Watts (KWW) expression3,35,36:

where σ tð Þ and σ0 represent the immediate and initial stress in the
second stage, respectively; t’ = t-tw is the time in the second stage; τ1
and τ2 are the characteristic relaxation times; β1 and β2 are the
stretching exponents describing the non-exponential behavior of the
relaxations. A and 1-A reﬂect the corresponding relaxation intensity.
The ﬁtted relaxation time is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.
The inﬂuence of the pre-loading time tw on the stress memory
effect is studied for three representative glasses, as shown in Fig. 3a–c.
The dependence of the memory strength Δσ on pre-loading time is
shown in Fig. 3d–f. Generally, the Δσ increases monotonically as the
preloading time increases. It is interesting to note that there exists a
critical time, before which the Δσ is very small, but after which the Δσ
increases sharply. This is a notable result of the stress memory effect,
which has not been reported in disordered granular systems.
Discussion
To study the physical origin of the emerging stress memory effect, the
relaxation activation energy Ea during the preloading stage was calcu-
lated according to the KWW and Arrhenius equations3,37,38 (see details in
section 4 of Supplementary information). The time-dependent Ea for
the three representative glasses during the preloading step are shown in
the upper panels of Fig. 4a–c. Considering Figs. 3 and 4, the Ea is small
and does not change much with relaxation time while the stress mem-
ory effect is weak. When the relaxation time is long enough where the
stress memory becomes strong, the Ea increases fast. The analogous
change in Ea during isothermal annealing was reported in different
glasses35,39–41, and it is attributed to the increased atomic collectivity
during relaxation.
Furthermore, we studied the strain recovery behavior after the
preloading, see Supplementary Fig. 7. Below the glass transition tem-
perature Tg, the mechanical response of the glassy system usually
includes the instantaneous recoverable elastic strain εel, slow reco-
verable anelastic strain εan, and irrecoverable viscoplastic strain εvp, as
distinguished in Supplementary Fig. 7a. The fraction of strain recovery
(1  εvp=ε1) of three glasses after various preloading times tw are shown
in the lower panels of Fig. 4. When the tw is short, the glasses exhibit
complete strain recovery. When the tw is long enough where stress
memory thrives, the glass cannot recover completely, which suggests
irreversible conﬁguration during the preloading process42. The rever-
sible process is clearly associated with the small Ea (see the upper
panels of Fig. 4), and it should be related to the activation and motion
of localized soft domains that are constrained by the elastic matrix40–44.

As for the long-time annealing, the irrecoverable viscoplastic strain
emerges associated with the sharp increase in Ea, and it derives from
the percolation and cooperative motions of soft domains42,45. The fast
and slow relaxation processes can be identiﬁed respectively as β pro-
cess and collective motion39,40,42,46.
To unravel the structural origin of the stress memory effect, we
utilize high energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction to investigate the
atomic scale structural changes in TiZrHfCuNiBe MG during the stress
memory effect, and the experimental technical details are displayed in
Supplementary Fig. 8. Figure 5a, c shows the reduced pair distribution
functions G(r) of TiZrHfCuNiBe MG during the preloading stage and
during the memory stage, respectively (stress evolution curve shown
in Supplementary Fig. 8c). Close inspections indicate that the ﬁrst
nearest neighbor shell split into two sub-peaks (insets in Fig. 5a, c),
in which the left sub-peak corresponds to the shorter inter-atomic
band lengths dominated by small-size atoms, while the larger atoms
dominate the right sub-peak46–48. According to the interatomic bond
lengths and weight factors provided in Supplementary Table 1, the left
sub-peak at approximately 2.70 Å can be primarily attributed to the Hf-
Cu and Hf-Ni atomic pairs, while the right sub-peak at around 3.10 Å is
mainly dominated by the Zr-Hf, Hf-Hf, and Ti-Hf atomic pairs.
As the stress decays, the full width athalf maximum (FWHM) of the ﬁrst
G(r) peak decreases (Fig. 5b), together with the left-shifted peak
position, it suggests that the atomic packing becomes denser at a
longer time47. But when stress increases during the memory stage
(Fig. 5d), the FWHM increases and the peak position shifts to the right-
hand side. This suggests that the atomic packing in the short-range
becomes loose.
The anelastic recovery tests under the various preloading condi-
tions in TiZrHfCuNiBe MG were performed to investigate the rever-
sible contribution to the deformation, as illustrated in Supplementary
Fig. 9. The anelastic recovery process can be ﬁtted by the KWW

in Supplementary Fig. 9. Figure 5e conﬁrms a linear relationship
between the peak time tp and the recovery characteristic time τrec over
several decades. This indicates that the stress memory effect origi-
nates from the recovery of reversible anelastic components.
Figure 5f shows a schematic illustration of the local atomic
arrangement for reversible events in stress relaxation. As the strain
increases ðεI ! εΠÞ, the atoms pack more densely. This reconﬁgura-
tion arises from the diffusion of small atoms within the network
formed by the large solvent atomics, and it can be related to the left
shift of the ﬁrst sub-peak (Fig. 5a). During the memory stage when
unloading to a lower strain ðεΠ ! εIÞ, the small atoms move toward a
looser conﬁguration according to the right shift of the ﬁrst sub-peaks
(Fig. 5c). This observation coincides with the atomic mechanisms of
the dynamic process in β relaxation47,50. This result indicates that the
stress memory effect arises from reversible β relaxations.
Recent evidence has stated that the rejuvenation of glasses could
be induced by the mismatch of the thermal expansion coefﬁcient or
the modulus ﬂuctuation between neighboring local domains51–53 when
subjected to the same external perturbation. For the stress memory
effect, as the applied strain jumps to a lower value, the mismatch of
momentary modulus between neighboring local domains produces
internal stresses, which would induce an inverse process and increase
the stress. Longer preloading can stimulate abundant internal stress
and facilitate more runback of reversible β events upon unloading,

which generate a more pronounced stress memory effect in the col-
lective motion process (see Fig. 3). This aligns with the thriving of the
Kovacs memory effect in a deep aging state characterized by a large
activation entropy15. The herein reversible β events also support the
rational presence of the reversible faster relaxing element in the phe-
nomenological Amir–Oreg–Imry (AOI) model1,2, which has been widely
used to explain the nonmonotonic relaxation phenomenon2,22,23,54.
The classical Kovacs memory effect has a typical three-temperature
protocol5,6,19,25,34,55, say T0, T2 and T1, where T0 is the initial equilibrated
temperature, T1 and T2 are annealing temperatures. The Kovacs mem-
ory effect happens only as T0>T2>T1, while herein the stress memory
effect happens only ε0<ε2<ε1. Inspired by the theoretical works of Pra-
dos et al.14,19,26, the contribution of the temperature perturbation to the
glass system is alike to the stress/strain by considering βE / βσε. Here
β =
1
kBT, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. E represents the energy,
which is basically proportional to σε19. Then, we can understand the
effect of applied strain ε on the glass system as a perturbation β in the
Kovacs memory effect. For instance, the low-to-high temperature
annealing leads to a decrease in β, which is equal to the stimulation of
high-to-low strain annealing in the protocol under a ﬁxed temperature
(Fig. 1a). The convergence of the two memory effects stems from their
common structural origin, as the classical Kovacs memory effect also
may arise from the recovery of reversible loosely packed regions56,57.
In conclusion, we have observed a Kovacs-like stress memory
effect when glasses are stimulated by high-to-low two-step strain sti-
mulations. The stress memory only appears when the second-step
strain is smaller than the ﬁrst-step strain. Larger applied strain, longer
stimulation time in the ﬁrst stage, and higher temperature make the
memory effect stronger. The runback of reversible motions of small
atoms is the essential mobilizing mechanism of the memory effect,
which is conﬁrmed by the reconﬁguration of short-range atomic
packing structures.
Methods
Sample fabrication
The master alloys of Ti16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7Cu16.7Ni16.7Be16.7, (Fe11Zr1)91.2B8.8
(at%) were prepared by arc melting. The metallic glass ribbons with a
thickness of approximately 30 μm were fabricated by the melt spin-
ning with a tangent velocity of approximately 40 m/s. Polyvinyl
chloride ﬁlms with a thickness of approximately 150 μm were pur-
chased from the manufacturer.
Dynamic characterization
The dynamical mechanical behavior of the three glasses was
measured using the dynamic thermomechanical analysis apparatus
(TA-DMA Q800). The mechanical spectroscopy measurements
were performed at a heating rate of 5 K/min with a driving fre-
quency of 1 Hz.
Stress-relaxation and strain-recovery measurements
Isothermal stress relaxation tests were performed on a TA DMA-Q800
instrument using one or two-step protocols (see Fig. 1a) at target
temperatures. Subsequently, the strain recovery tests were conducted
by unloading the stress after the relaxation period.
Structural characterization
The local structural characterization was performed in China’s Beij-
ing synchrotron radiation facility. The in-situ experiments were
conducted in the synchrotron X-ray beam at 3W1, which utilized
monochromatic synchrotron radiation with a wavelength of 0.2065 Å
(energy of 60.037 keV). The diffraction experiments were carried out
in the Debye-Scherrer geometry. The layout of the experimental
setup is shown in Supplementary Fig. 8a. The incident beam had a
well-collimated cross-section of 0.8× 0.8 mm². Diffraction patterns
were collected using an iRay Mercu 1717HS image plate detector,
which had a resolution of 3072 × 3072 pixels, with each pixel corre-
sponding to a size of 139× 139 µm². The detector was carefully
positioned orthogonal to the x-ray beam, and the distance between
the 2D detector and the sample was adjusted to about 280 mm in

The specimens of amorphous ribbon were subjected to tension
using the Linkam TST350 straining system. Supplementary Fig. 8b
shows the loading protocol for tensile stress relaxation with two dif-
ferent applied strains (ε1 = 0:5%,ε1 = 0:3%) at a temperature of 593 K.
The tensile strain was increased in increments of 200%/min, and the
gauge length of Linkam TST350 was 40 mm. The stress evolution
corresponding to the two-step process is shown in Supplemen-
tary Fig. 8c.
