Abstract: An adequate nutritional intake is recommended for the prevention of physical frailty and
sarcopenia. In particular, medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are reportedly important for muscle
strength in nursing home residents. However, the effects of MCFAs on healthy adults at risk for frailty
remain unknown. Hence, a randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the
effects of 12 weeks of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) intake and walking on muscle mass and
function in healthy, sedentary, middle-aged and older adults with a low body mass index. Three
MCT intake groups with different amounts of octanoic and decanoic acid intake were compared with
a control group. After 12 weeks, knee extension strength increased in all groups, with the increases
in all MCT intake groups being signiﬁcantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05). Grip
strength signiﬁcantly increased from baseline in the MCT 6 g/day intake group (p < 0.05). The
combination of aerobic exercise and MCT intake may be effective in preventing decline in muscle
strength and promoting increase in muscle strength as they can improve muscle energy production,
thereby contributing to the maintenance of good health for middle-aged and older adults at high risk
for frailty and sarcopenia.

1. Introduction
Frailty, which can occur when elderly persons experience a decline in physical and
mental health, is associated with a higher risk of hospitalization and mortality [1]. In
Japan, lifespans for both males and females with mild to moderate disability due to the
progression of frailty have increased between 1995 and 2004 [2]. A systematic review and
meta-analysis revealed that frailty is associated with increased healthcare costs among
community-dwelling older adults [3]. Therefore, preventing frailty among the elderly is
a desirable outcome in terms of reducing healthcare expenses. The mean score of muscle
strength in healthy older adults is reportedly 20–40% lower than that of young adults [4],
indicating age-related deterioration of muscle composition and function.
Fried et al. deﬁned frailty as a clinical syndrome in which three or more of the
following criteria are present: unintentional weight loss (10 lbs in past year), self-reported
exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed, and low physical activity.
Xue et al. further associated physical frailty with decreased intake (decreased appetite) and

sarcopenia, identifying chronic undernutrition (inadequate intake of protein and energy)
as a cause of weight loss, and sarcopenia as a cause of exhaustion, low physical activity,
slow walking speed, and weakness (e.g., reduced grip strength) [5]. These relationships are
shown in the proposed frailty cycle, in which nutritional intake and frailty prevention are
inseparable, as sarcopenia leads to decreased nutritional intake (decreased appetite).
Several reports have observed an association between nutritional status and frailty,
with cross-sectional studies showing an association between low energy intake and frailty
and an increased risk of frailty with low energy intake [6,7]. Prospective studies have
also demonstrated an increased risk of frailty and mortality associated with low energy
intake [8]. Japanese clinical guidelines [9] recommend that appropriate nutritional intake,
especially protein intake, may be effective in the prevention and suppression of sarcopenia,
with high-energy, high-protein foods being recommended for the elderly. However, system-
atic reviews have shown inconsistent effects of protein supplementation on muscle mass
and muscle function [10,11]. In addition, some elderly have difﬁculty increasing their di-
etary intakes due to decreased appetite and digestive function [12,13], making it beneﬁcial
for them to eat small nutritious meals for easily maintained muscle mass and function.
Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are straight-chain saturated fatty acids with carbon
numbers between 6 and 12 in length. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are
composed of MCFAs, are oils that are preferentially converted into energy in the body after
ingestion, unlike long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) that are found in regular oils [14]. The
characteristics of MCT enables an increase in energy intake, even in elderly individuals
with decreased appetite. MCT has been used for the medical nutritional supplementation of
premature infants and postoperative patients. Moreover, studies have shown that nursing
home residents who consumed MCT had improved grip strength and walking speed [15].
Consumption of MCFAs increases the active form of ghrelin [16], which strongly stimulates
the secretion of the growth hormone (GH) promoting skeletal muscle protein synthesis
through insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). MCTs are an effective nutrient for the elderly
as they are easy to digest, energy-rich, and help to maintain and enhance muscle strength
and function. However, the effects of continued MCT intake in healthy older adults are not
yet fully understood. While there are reports of increased plasma acyl ghrelin levels with
the administration of 3 g/day of octanoic acid triglyceride [17], the impact of lower doses
of MCT on muscle mass and strength remains unclear. Moreover, two MCFAs, octanoic
and decanoic acids, reportedly affect metabolism through different mechanisms [18], but
no reports have been found on the effects of decanoic acid-dominant MCTs on muscle.
In this study, we tested whether continuous MCT intake is effective in maintaining
and preventing loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength in healthy community-dwelling
middle-aged and older adults. Along with continuous MCT intake, subjects engaged
in moderate-intensity walking, and the impact of different MCT amounts and MCFAs
compositions was examined. A combination of walking (an aerobic exercise that is easier to
perform than resistance training) and MCT intake can maintain or suppress the reduction
in skeletal muscle mass and strength in middle-aged and older adults at risk of frailty.
Moreover, foods containing MCFAs as well as an active lifestyle may help middle-aged
and older adults maintain their health.

2.2. Subjects
After obtaining the consent of patients to participate in the study, the principal inves-
tigator enrolled subjects who met the selection criteria and were able to comply with the
management procedures during the trial period.
The selection criteria were Japanese males and females (1) aged between 60 and
75 years at the time of obtaining written consent, (2) with body mass indexes (BMIs)
between 19 kg/m2 and 24 kg/m2, (3) who exercised or walked less than once a week and
for less than 30 min at a time, (4) who do not engage in childcare or nursing care on a
daily basis (more than 4 h per week), and (5) who were fully informed of the purpose and
content of the study, had the capacity to consent, understood the study well, voluntarily
volunteered to participate, and agreed to participate in the study in writing.
Exclusion criteria included subjects who (1) had been instructed by a physician to
refrain from walking or exercising; (2) were currently receiving medication or inpatient
treatment for any serious illness; (3) were currently under the supervision of a physician for
exercise or diet therapy; (4) could develop allergies to soybean, shrimp, crab, wheat, milk,
egg, almond, squid, orange, cashew nut, kiwifruit, beef, sesame, salmon, mackerel, chicken,
banana, pork, peach, yam, apple, or gelatin; (5) had a current or history of drug or alcohol
dependence; (6) were currently visiting the hospital for mental disorders (e.g., depression)
or sleep disorders (e.g., insomnia, sleep apnea syndrome, and so on), or had a history
of mental illness; (7) were current smokers or had smoked in the past 3 months; (8) had
irregular lifestyles due to night work or shift work; (9) had an extremely irregular lifestyle
in terms of eating, sleeping, and so on; (10) were very fussy eaters; (11) had a weight
ﬂuctuation of ±5 kg or more within a 3-month period; (12) had knee surgery or leg problem
and used a walking cane daily; (13) had a serious current or previous illness, such as brain
disease, malignant tumor, immunological disease, diabetes, liver disease (e.g., hepatitis),
renal disease, cardiac disease, thyroid disease, adrenal disease, or other metabolic disease;
(14) had used (or was currently using) health foods, supplements, or medicines that affect
muscle strength, walking function, or fatigue reduction in the past 3 months; (15) consumed
or were currently consuming any health oil (e.g., coconut oil or MCT oil) that may enhance
any of the dietary components being evaluated, retroactively, in the past 3 months; (16) had
participated in other clinical trials within 3 months prior to the date of consent or have
plans to participate in other clinical trials during the study period; (17) had donated more
than 200 mL of blood within 1 month or more than 400 mL of blood within 3 months prior
to the date of obtaining consent; (18) were currently pregnant or lactating, or may become
pregnant or lactate during the study period; (19) had difﬁculty in complying with recording
on various questionnaires; (20) were judged to be unsuitable as subjects based on clinical
laboratory values and measurements at the time of screening; or (21) were judged by the
investigator to be unsuitable as subjects.
2.3. Target Number of Cases
In a previous study, in which 21 elderly nursing home residents with a BMI of
23 kg/m2 or less and 65 years of age or older were given 6 g of MCT contained in a
test food per day for 3 months, increased grip strength was conﬁrmed [19]. In the current
study, the daily intake of MCT was either 6 g or 2 g, which is the same or one-third of the
MCT intake in the previous study. The number of patients required for the current study
was set at 30 per group, for a total of 120 cases, based on the expectation that the number
of cases would increase, and that dropouts and ineligible subjects would occur during the
course of the study.
2.4. Test Design
Tests were conducted as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group study. The study food allocation manager assigned subjects via stratiﬁed
randomization to three test food intake groups and one control food group. The stratiﬁ-
cation factors were age, sex, and blood albumin levels. The test food allocation manager
Nutrients 2023, 15, 3275
4 of 25
kept the study food allocation list strictly conﬁdential until key opening, and blinding was
maintained for all parties, except the study food allocation manager.
During the study period, subjects were instructed as follows. (1) Refrain from excessive
exercise (except for the exercise intervention described below) and maintain a normal
lifestyle. (2) Ensure non-routine household chores that require physical effort (e.g., major
cleaning, redecorating/repairing the house, shoveling snow, and so on) are limited to
once a week. In addition, when household chores that fell under the above categories
are performed, record the details on the daily lifestyle survey form. (3) Limit day outings
for recreation to twice a month, and limit consecutive outings involving overnight stays
to 3 days or less and once a month. In the event that leisure activities that fall under the
above categories are undertaken, or in the event that the number of outings exceeds the
stipulated number of days for unavoidable reasons, record the details on the lifestyle survey
form. (4) Maintain the usual lifestyle and environment (such as eating, drinking, sleeping,
working, and so on, other than the aforementioned test meals prior to participation in the
study) as much as possible. (5) Do not take any medicines, supplements, or health foods
that may affect muscle mass/muscle strength, walking function, or fatigue reduction. If
such a ingestion was unavoidable, contact the consultation desk in advance if possible. If
ingested, record the details on the lifestyle survey form. (6) During the study period, record
the regular intake of unrestricted medicines, supplements, or health foods on the lifestyle
survey form, and continue the habit. If you are not currently taking these additional
substances, refrain from intaking them for the study period. However, if this becomes
unavoidable, notify the consultation desk in advance if possible. (7) During the study
period, do not consume health oils (coconut oil, MCT oil, and so on) that could possibly
enhance the dietary components that are to be evaluated. (8) During the study period,
dairy products could be consumed as long as the amount and frequency remained as usual.
In the unlikely event of a change, record the details on the lifestyle survey form. (9) During
the study period, do not to participate in any other clinical trials. (10) Do not donate blood
or blood products during the study period. (11) If you wish to receive immunizations,
health checkups, or physical examinations during the study period, report this in advance
to the consultation desk and record it on the lifestyle survey form.
2.5. Test Foods and Dietary Surveys
One package of the test food contained a total of 3 g of long-chain triglyceride (LCT)
(Nisshin Canola Oil; The Nisshin OilliO Group, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) or/and MCT (Nissin
MCT Oil, Nissin MCT-C10R; The Nisshin OilliO Group). From the 0-week test day until the
day before the 12-week test, two packets of test food were administered daily, comprising
one packet after two meals among breakfast, lunch, or dinner, for a total of two packets
per day. The subjects in each group were administered one of the following test foods as
their experimental food: control food, decanoic acid food, low-dose octanoic acid food, or
high-dose octanoic acid food. The amounts of LCT, MCT, and MCFA in MCT per 6 g of fat
in the test foods consumed per day are shown in Table 1.

During the 12-week intervention period, dietary surveys were conducted at baseline,
and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after intervention. Surveys were carried out using a simpliﬁed
Nutrients 2023, 15, 3275
5 of 25
self-administered dietary history questionnaire (brief-type self-administered diet history
questionnaire: BDHQ) from which nutrient intakes were calculated.
2.6. Exercise Intervention
During the examination period, subjects in all groups were instructed to walk outdoors
for 40 ± 10 min, 2 days per week, and to record any other activities in a lifestyle survey.
The walking speed was to be maintained at the usual pace. Additionally, it was speciﬁed
that exercise should not be performed on consecutive days whenever possible.
In the event of inclement weather conditions such as heavy rain or extreme heat that
would make safe outdoor walking difﬁcult, the following indoor alternative exercises
were permitted:
(1)
Walking on a treadmill or other walking machines at a normal walking speed for a
designated period of time.
(2)
Foot stomping on a ﬂat surface for a designated time at a tempo equivalent to normal
walking without moving.
If exercise was substituted for (1) or (2) above, or, if exercise could not be carried out
due to unavoidable reasons, the reason was recorded on the lifestyle questionnaire.
2.7. Life Surveys
During the study period, the subjects were asked to record their daily living conditions,
such as consumption of test foods, physical condition, medications, exercise, and alcohol
consumption on the lifestyle questionnaire.
2.8. Adverse Events
Adverse events were investigated daily during the subjects’ consumption of the
test foods by using a lifestyle questionnaire. In addition, laboratory values were also
checked for abnormal ﬂuctuations. If an adverse event was observed, the principal in-
vestigator took appropriate measures as necessary and categorized the adverse events
into three levels: mild—not requiring any intervention and allowing the trial to continue;
moderate—requiring some form of intervention; and severe—intolerable, thus necessitating
the discontinuation of the trial. Furthermore, adverse events were classiﬁed into six levels:
none, probably none, possible, probably present, present, and evaluation impossible. Only
adverse events determined to have a causal relationship with the test food (excluding those
classiﬁed as probably none or none) were considered as side effects.
2.9. Measurements
During the 12-week intervention period, body composition, grip strength, knee ex-
tension strength, and walking ability were measured before intervention, at and 4, 8, and
12 weeks after intervention.
Body composition was measured using a body composition analyzer InBody S10
(InBody Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
Grip strength was measured using the Grip-D Smedley digital grip strength tester
TKK-5401 (Takei Scientiﬁc Instruments Co., Ltd., Kamo, Japan) in accordance with the
Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Implementation Guidelines,
which recommended the following new physical ﬁtness test.
(1)
The subject is asked to be in a standing position, with the upper limb in a drooping
position and the forearm in a mid-rotational position.
(2)
The grasping bar of the grip strength meter should be adjusted so that it is half the
length from the base of the subject’s thumb to the tip of the index ﬁnger.
(3)
The measurement of maximum grip strength involved two consecutive measurements
in the following order: right hand, left hand, 1 min rest, right hand, left hand. The
recorded representative value was the average value.
Nutrients 2023, 15, 3275
6 of 25
Knee extension strength of both right and left legs was measured using a lower limb
muscle strength measuring device (Locomo Scan-II; ALCARE Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
As an indicator of walking ability [20], the timed up and go test (TUG) was performed
using the Multi-Timer T.T.K.5801 device (Takei Scientiﬁc Instruments Co., Ltd., Kamo,
Japan) as follows.
(1)
Have the subject sit deeply in a chair and start walking on the examiner’s cue.
(2)
The examiner instructs the subject as follows: “Please walk as quickly as possible,
go around the pole located 3 m ahead, in any direction you prefer. Once you return,
please sit down on the chair immediately”.
(3)
The time from when the subject’s body starts moving until their buttocks made contact
with the chair was measured. The measurement was taken once.
2.10. Statistical Analysis
The obtained data were analyzed using the methods speciﬁed in the statistical analysis
plan prepared prior to the start of the study. The nutrient intake levels were presented as
mean ± standard deviation for pre-intervention (week 0) and post-intervention (weeks 4,
8, and 12) calculated values. In addition, measurements of body composition, muscle
strength, and TUG were taken, calculating the changes from pre-intervention (week 0) as
the reference to post-intervention (weeks 4, 8, and 12), and the values were presented as
mean ± standard deviation.
Nutritional intake during the intervention period was subjected to multiple compar-
isons to compare the control and test diet groups. First, the presence or absence of homo-
geneity of variance was conﬁrmed for each data using Levene’s test, then Steel’s test was
conducted if signiﬁcance was found, and Dunnett’s test was used if it was not signiﬁcant.
For other measured variables, ﬁrst, multiple comparisons were conducted among the
four groups for the value at week 0 of intake. If no signiﬁcant differences were found, a
linear mixed-effects model was utilized (with ﬁxed effects for diet and time of measurement,
and a random intercept for subjects) to examine the interaction between diet effects and time
effects for the repeated measurements. If no interaction effect was observed, a linear mixed-
effects model equation without the interaction term was used to conﬁrm the presence
of diet effects for the repeated measurements (weeks 4, 8, and 12). If diet effects were
detected, multiple comparisons were conducted among the four groups at each time point
(weeks 4, 8, and 12). If an interaction effect was observed, a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was performed to conﬁrm the diet effects, and if signiﬁcant differences were
found, multiple comparisons among the four groups at each time point (weeks 4, 8, and 12)
were conducted. The multiple comparisons among the four groups were tested using
Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance, and if signiﬁcance was observed, Steel’s test was
employed for testing, while Dunnett’s test was used when signiﬁcance was not observed.
For within-group comparisons between the data at week 0 and the data at weeks 4, 8,
and 12 of test food intake, multiple comparisons were conducted using Levene’s test to
assess homogeneity of variance. If signiﬁcance was observed, Steel’s test was employed for
testing, while Dunnett’s test was used when signiﬁcance was not observed.
The basic statistics of the analyzed data were calculated using Microsoft Excel for
Ofﬁce365 MSO (Microsoft Japan Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and statistical processing was
performed using R statistical software v4.1.0 for Windows (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria).
In all signiﬁcance analyses, a signiﬁcance level below 5% was considered statistically
signiﬁcant, while a level between 5% and less than 10% was considered as a trend.

1 Values are shown as mean ± standard deviation.
2 Values are calculated using BDHQ: brief-type self-
administered diet history questionnaire, a simpliﬁed self-administered dietary history questionnaire.
3 Per
protocol set: dataset of subjects excluding those who were excluded as per the deﬁned criteria in the statistical
analysis plan. 4 Values were shown minus the value of octanoic acid and decanoic acid. 5 Values are the sum of
octanoic acid and decanoic acid (medium-chain fatty acids).
3.4. Body Composition
The values of body composition during the study period are shown in Table 4. No
signiﬁcant differences were observed between the test food group and the control group in
Nutrients 2023, 15, 3275

terms of body weight, protein mass, body fat mass, muscle mass, and lean body mass at
baseline, and at week 4, week 8, and week 12 post-intervention.
3.5. Muscle Strength
At week 12 of the intervention, the knee extension strength of all MCT intake groups
showed an increase compared to pre-intake values (Table 5). At the same point, the high-
dose octanoic acid group and the decanoic acid group exhibited higher values compared
to the control group. In terms of the change from pre-intake values, the right or bilateral
knee extension strength of all MCT intake groups was higher than that of the control group.
Although no intergroup differences were observed in grip strength, the left-hand maximum
grip strength signiﬁcantly increased from baseline in the high-dose octanoic acid group
and the decanoic acid group that consumed 6 g of MCT per day.
3.6. Walking Ability (TUG)
Lower values indicate improved walking ability. In all groups, including the control
group, there was a signiﬁcant decrease compared to pre-intake values thus indicating
improvement (Table 6). No signiﬁcant differences were observed among the groups.

4. Discussion
Cross-sectional studies have found an association between low BMI and frailty [21]. In
this study, the BMIs of eligible individuals were below 24 kg/m2 according to the inclusion
criteria. As a result, the subjects generally had a BMI lower than average for their age
group in the Japanese population, indicating that they were healthy middle-aged and older
adults at high risk of frailty. These subjects were given MCT while engaging in moderate-
intensity exercise for 12 weeks. The results showed that the knee extension strength of
all MCT intervention groups signiﬁcantly increased after 8 and 12 weeks compared to
the pre-intervention values. Furthermore, the change in right knee extension strength
from pre-intervention to week 12 was signiﬁcantly higher in all MCT intervention groups
compared to the control group. On the other hand, grip strength increased in the group
receiving 6 g/day of MCT compared to pre-intervention, but there was no signiﬁcant
difference compared to the control group.
We used the Locomo Scan-II device to measure knee extension strength. The knee
extension strength has been measured using an isokinetic machine as the gold standard
method, but such machines are large, immovable, require a skilled operator, and are not
suitable for quick measurements on a large group of subjects. Oomori et al. reported
that the knee extension strength measured using the Locomo Scan-II prototype showed a
signiﬁcant correlation with the measurements obtained using an isokinetic dynamometer
(Biodex system 3; Biodex Medical System Inc., Shirley, New York, NY, USA) in a sample of
1016 patients with knee osteoarthritis thus conﬁrming its utility [22]. Furthermore, a study
measuring knee extension strength using the Locomo Scan-II in 3617 healthy individuals
aged 20–89 from 20 prefectures in Japan found no signiﬁcant difference in strength among
individuals aged 20–40 years, but both men and women in older age groups showed a
signiﬁcant decline in knee extension strength with increasing age [23].
Knee extension strength is widely used in clinical practice as a representative measure
of lower limb support during walking, and it is reportedly closely related to walking inde-
pendence and walking speed [24,25]. It has been suggested that older adults with problems
in knee extension strength face difﬁculties in mobility [26]. Asakawa et al. demonstrated
a close relationship between decreased knee extension strength in community-dwelling
older adults and falls [27]. Moreover, measuring knee extension strength using an isoki-
netic machine is an accurate method for assessing quadriceps muscle strength. Many
studies [26–29] have demonstrated that quadriceps muscle strength is associated with
walking ability, suggesting that weakened quadriceps can lead to gait impairments and
increased fall risk in older adults. Furthermore, each muscle group in the lower limbs is
related to mobility limitation (ML), which affects the performance of movement activities
and is associated with a decline in activities of daily living (ADL) and reduced quality
of life in older adults [30]. It has been shown that reduced leg muscle strength strongly
inﬂuences ML [31]. ML in older adults [32] is recognized as an early sign of impairment
associated with aging stages [33]. Walking, stair climbing, and chair rising represent fun-
damental mobility abilities and risk factors, and a decline in these abilities is associated
with poor self-rated health [34], falls [35], hospitalization [36], and overall mortality [37].
Therefore, it is crucial to identify ML early and provide appropriate support as a primary
preventive measure.
In this study, we measured knee extension strength using the Locomo Scan-II device
as a tool to assess the degree of age-related impairments that increase the risk of physical
frailty and the effectiveness of interventions in mitigating these impairments. The average
knee extension strength in the study subjects was 327 N for men and 277 N for women
in their 60s, and 300 N for men and 262 N for women in their 70s. In a study by Narumi
et al. that measured knee extension strength using the Locomo Scan in healthy individuals,
the average values were 471 N for men and 405 N for women in their 60s, and 385 N for
men and 340 N for women in their 70s [23]. Therefore, the knee extension strength of the
subjects in this study was approximately 30% lower in their 60s and slightly over 20% lower
in their 70s compared to the measurements by Narumi et al., suggesting that they were

closer to frailty despite being healthy middle-aged and older individuals. On the other
hand, the post-intake knee extension strength of the subjects in the MCT intake group was
higher compared to the pre-intake or the control group. Therefore, for healthy middle-aged
and older individuals at a higher risk of frailty, combining moderate-intensity exercise with
MCT intake can potentially improve knee extension strength and suppress ML thereby
enhancing walking independence.
In this study, grip strength was also measured. Since walking was prescribed as a
moderate-intensity exercise in this trial, there was no direct stimulation to the upper limb
muscles through exercise. However, ghrelin which is secreted from the lower limb muscles
due to walking or from the stomach because of MCT intake may have a positive impact
on the muscles related to grip strength through the stimulated secretion of IGF-1. The
MCT intake group showed a signiﬁcant increase in grip strength compared to the baseline.
Although there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in grip strength between the MCT
intake group and the control group, it is speculated that MCT intake promoted the secretion
of ghrelin in the subjects’ bodies, leading to an increased secretion of IGF-1, which in turn
resulted in increased grip strength compared to before MCT intake. Grip strength is related
to knee extension strength [38], and it is considered a potential indicator for assessing ML.
The main strengths of grip strength measurement lie in its simplicity, high reliability, and
safety, as it can be measured via a simple gripping motion. A systematic review examining
the association between performance tests and health outcomes [39] demonstrated that grip
strength is the most widely applicable ﬁeld test. Furthermore, considering its association
with frailty [40], health-related quality of life [41], ADL impairments [42], and overall
mortality [43], which are more advanced stages of impairment beyond ML, grip strength
has a high potential to reﬂect the early signs of ML.
In this study, body muscle mass was measured in healthy subjects and no signiﬁcant
differences were found between the groups. Similar results were reported in a previous
study in which severely frail subjects with sarcopenia were fed the same amount of fats
and oils with the same MCFA composition as the high octanoic acid food group in this
study. Abe et al. found that after 3 months of consumption of 6 g of MCT and 1.2 g of
L-leucine or 20 µg of cholecalciferol or 6 g of MCT per day by residents of a special nursing
home who required helper assistance, knee extension time (a measure of muscle endurance)
and the number of leg openings and closings over 10 s (a measure of muscle strength)
improved signiﬁcantly compared to controls. Although they improved signiﬁcantly, there
were no differences in the calculated AMA or leg circumference (a measure of muscle
mass) between the study groups [15,19]. In previous meta-analyses, the administration
of 9–54 g/day MCT was not found to be associated with increased muscle mass [44,45].
Furthermore, the administration of 18–24 g/day MCT decreased fat-free mass in obese
patients in comparison with an olive oil-fed group [46], suggesting that the administration
of MCT is unlikely to substantially increase muscle mass. Several studies have reported
that even when muscle strength and function are enhanced through MCT intake, there are
no changes in muscle mass.
The balance between muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown
(MPB) determines the net rate of muscle growth [47]. In the fasting state, there is a negative
protein balance resulting in a decrease in protein mass. Feeding induces an increase in
muscle protein synthesis, offsetting the losses in the fasting state. Through this cycle,
muscle mass is generally maintained in adults. However, humans (typically beyond the
age of 60 years) begin to experience a gradual decline in overall muscle mass, albeit at a
slow rate [48]. This is caused by a gradual decrease in the rate of muscle protein synthesis
with age [49]. There is limited evidence regarding the effects of MCT on muscle protein
synthesis (MPS), including animal studies. Regarding the effects of MCT on muscle protein
breakdown (MPB), Nishimura et al. suggested the potential inhibition of disuse muscle
atrophy in soleus muscle [50]. They demonstrated that the decrease in muscle mass and
muscle protein content caused by disuse muscle atrophy in rats with immobilization
was suppressed due to MCT intake. It was speculated that MCT inhibits the ubiquitin-

proteasome pathway, which is a major protein degradation pathway upregulated in inactive
muscles. The subjects in this study had an exercise frequency of less than the average
for their age group, indicating that this was a group experiencing muscle degeneration
due to protein breakdown from inactivity. Although there is a possibility that MCT intake
inhibited muscle protein breakdown in these subjects, there was no difference in muscle
mass between the MCT intake group and the control group. This may be because the effect
of MCT on human muscle protein breakdown was so small that no change in muscle mass
occurred, or because changes in muscle mass take longer to occur.
The effects of MCT intake, which are speculated to be the underlying mechanisms
for the observed increase in muscle strength in this study, have been reported in previous
studies. For instance, Ishizawa et al. compared rats fed a high-fat diet with either LCT
or MCT for 4 weeks to rats fed a standard diet. They found that MCT intake resulted in
increased mitochondrial citrate synthase enzyme activity in all types of skeletal muscles
examined (triceps brachii, superﬁcial and deep portions of the gastrocnemius, and soleus
muscle) compared to the control group fed a standard diet (p < 0.05). This suggested that
MCT intake may increase the expression of citrate synthase enzymes in both fast-twitch and
slow-twitch muscle ﬁbers, promoting fatty acid oxidation [51]. Fushiki et al. conducted a
study where mice underwent forced swimming every other day for 6 weeks while being fed
either a LCFA diet or a MCFAs diet [52]. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the weight
of the quadriceps femoris or gastrocnemius muscles on the ﬁnal day of the experiment.
However, in the quadriceps femoris of the MCFAs diet group, the activity of 3-oxo acid
CoA-transferase (OXCT) (an enzyme involved in the uptake of ketone bodies from the
bloodstream), citrate synthase enzymes involved in the TCA cycle in the gastrocnemius,
and malate dehydrogenase were signiﬁcantly higher than in the LCFA diet group. This
suggested an increased rate of uptake and utilization of ketone bodies (a lipid-based energy
substrate) by muscle cells, and enhanced intracellular energy production. The swimming
capacity of these mice, until exhaustion, was signiﬁcantly higher in the MCFAs diet group
compared to the LCFA diet group. It is speculated that the changes induced by MCFAs
in these enzymes contributed to the increased swimming capacity. However, there was
no change in the weight of the muscles despite the alterations in enzyme activity. In
the subjects of our study, the impact of MCT intake on muscle protein metabolism was
not signiﬁcant enough to cause a signiﬁcant difference in muscle mass compared to the
control group. However, the changes in energy metabolism enzymes in the muscles likely
enhanced fatty acid oxidation capacity, resulting in abundant energy supply during muscle
activation and an increase in muscle strength. Therefore, MCT may act on muscle energy
metabolism rather than muscle protein metabolism.
There have been several reports on the effects of combining exercise with food compo-
nents other than MCT on muscle mass, muscle strength, and muscle function in healthy
older adults. Nagai et al. reported the results of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with re-
sistance training, in which 36 healthy men and women aged 71 to 76 years assigned to either
a control group (n = 19) or an intervention group (n = 17) received 60 mg/day of maslinic
acid or a placebo for 12 weeks [53]. The 12-week maslinic acid intervention signiﬁcantly
improved skeletal muscle mass and segmental muscle mass (right arm, left arm, and trunk).
Additionally, only the intervention group showed a signiﬁcant increase in grip strength. In
addition, Vukovich et al. reported the results of an RCT with resistance training, where
31 healthy men and women aged 70 ± 1 years were assigned to either a control group
(n = 17) or an intervention group (n = 14) received 3 g/day of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate
(HMB) or a placebo for 8 weeks [54]. The intervention group showed a tendency of in-
creased fat-free mass after 8 weeks compared to the control group (p = 0.08). Additionally,
the intervention group exhibited a signiﬁcant increase in leg strength compared to the
control group after 8 weeks. Furthermore, Stout et al. [55] reported the results of an RCT
with resistance training, in which 36 healthy men and women aged 65 years and older
were assigned to either a control group (n = 20) or an intervention group (n = 16) received
3 g/day of calcium β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (CaHMB) or a placebo for 24 weeks. Al-

though there were no signiﬁcant differences between the control and intervention groups,
both groups showed a signiﬁcant increase (p < 0.05) in muscle mass and muscle strength
(leg strength) after 24 weeks compared to the baseline.
In these interventions, unlike MCT, there were differences in muscle mass compared
to the control groups. As a result, it is suggested that muscle mass was maintained. One
possible reason for the higher muscle mass is the potential effect of these food components
on stimulating muscle protein synthesis. For instance, when maslinic acid was administered
in the feed of rainbow trout for 225 days, a signiﬁcant increase in white muscle weight
and protein synthesis rate was observed in the trout compared to the control group [56].
Moreover, the addition of maslinic acid to C2C12 myoblast cells resulted in enhanced
phosphorylation of the 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), downstream of
mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR), leading to increased protein synthesis [57]. In
mice induced with disuse muscle atrophy, oral administration of maslinic acid increased
protein synthesis in the gastrocnemius muscle, and continuous intake of maslinic acid for
14 days signiﬁcantly increased muscle weight in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles,
as well as grip strength [58]. Based on the above, it is thought that maslinic acid intake
may be effective in maintaining muscle mass, which decreases with age, as it improves
muscle protein synthesis function through the activation of m-TOR. On the other hand,
the involvement of HMB and CaHMB increases phosphorylation of mammalian target
of rapamycin protein (hereafter referred to as m-TOR), its downstream 70 kDa ribosomal
protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor-4 binding protein-1
(4E-BP1) (which constituent 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate). It may promote muscle protein
synthesis by directly activating m-TOR, which plays a central role in cell growth [59–62].
In addition, GH and IGF-1, which are upstream of m-TOR, are increased, suggesting
that m-TOR and muscle protein synthesis are activated through changes in GH/IGF-1
activity [63–65]. In other words, food components that promote muscle protein synthesis,
such as maslinic acid and HMB, are thought to contribute to the maintenance of muscle
mass in the elderly by suppressing the decline in MPS and the imbalance between MPS
and MPB. Additionally, while studies on maslinic acid and HMB have employed resistance
exercise as a concurrent exercise, this study involved moderate-intensity exercise. This
difference in exercise type may be one factor contributing to the discrepancy in results
between this study and interventions with maslinic acid and HMB.
In this study, the results showed that while there was no signiﬁcant improvement
in muscle mass, there was a signiﬁcant improvement in muscle strength after 12 weeks
of concurrent intake of MCT along with moderate-intensity exercise. Additionally, it is
generally believed that muscle strength does not improve with training below moderate
intensity. However, in this study, the control group that consumed LCT showed an increase
in muscle strength after 12 weeks, and the MCT group demonstrated a signiﬁcantly greater
increase in muscle strength compared to the LCT group.
Resistance training has been considered the most effective exercise therapy for main-
taining and improving muscle mass in patients with sarcopenia. Typically, strength training
with a load setting of 60–70% of one-repetition maximum (1RM) has been recommended for
the purpose of muscle hypertrophy and strength enhancement [66]. For instance, Balakrish-
nan et al. observed an increase in mitochondrial DNA copy number in the external oblique
muscle of elderly CKD patients with mitochondrial dysfunction following resistance train-
ing load. There was a positive correlation between changes in mitochondrial DNA copy
number, type I and type II muscle ﬁber cross-sectional area, and muscle strength [67]. These
ﬁndings suggest that interventions promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, such as resistance
training, may be associated with increased muscle strength. However, exercise training is
adopted only by a very small percentage of elderly individuals, possibly because of their
frailty (15]. Furthermore, some reports suggest that resistance training is contraindicated in
malnutrition [68]. Therefore, caution should be exercised when applying resistance training
to the elderly for the purpose of maintaining muscle mass [69].
Nutrients 2023, 15, 3275

Recently, it has become evident that muscle hypertrophy can be induced by repeatedly
performing long-duration low-intensity exercise to the point of fatigue [70]. A study con-
ducted among community-dwelling individuals aged 60 years and above, involving 12 weeks
of low-intensity exercise (20% of 1RM) with high frequency (1 set of 80–100 repetitions), re-
sulted in a significant increase in muscle mass [71]. Furthermore, moderate-intensity exercise
load has the potential to improve mitochondrial dysfunction, a factor contributing to sar-
copenia due to its activation of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ co-activator-1α
(PGC1-α) and increased mitochondrial biogenesis [72,73]. Therefore, even with exercise
interventions of lower intensity than resistance training, it has been suggested that sufficient
energy supply to skeletal muscles can enhance muscle function. In fact, reports have shown
that long-term implementation of endurance training such as walking leads to improvements
in muscle strength and hypertrophic effects [70]. Additionally, while exercise intervention
alone may not have significant effects on muscle mass and strength, some reports indicate that
combining it with dietary therapy can enhance its effectiveness. For instance, Yamada et al.,
conducted an RCT comparing a resistance training plus nutrition group with a resistance
training alone group among frail elderly individuals, and reported that the resistance training
plus nutrition group showed significant improvements in skeletal muscle index, maximum
walking speed, and a decrease in the prevalence of sarcopenia, whereas the resistance training
alone group remained unchanged [74].
We investigated the possibility of maintaining muscle mass and strength with a
combination of dietary and exercise interventions, even with lower intensity exercise. As a
result, lower limb strength increased, but it did not lead to an increase in muscle mass. This
could be attributed to factors such as the intensity or frequency of the exercise employed in
this study, or the duration of the intervention, which may have been insufﬁcient compared
to previous reports that demonstrated changes in muscle mass with exercise loads below
moderate intensity. On the other hand, even in the control group that consumed LCT,
knee extension strength increased compared to the pre-intervention measurements. In
middle-aged and older individuals who are at high risk of future frailty due to lack of
exercise or a sedentary lifestyle, it is believed that, if they are healthy, resolving the issue of
physical inactivity through exercise can lead to the maintenance of muscle strength and
reduction in frailty risk. The results suggest that MCT intake has the potential to further
enhance the preventive effects against frailty.
In this study, we also examined the effects of different quantities and compositions of
MCFAs in MCT. Regarding the observed changes and trends in knee extension strength and
grip strength in this study, we investigated the differences in the composition of MCFAs
in MCT consumed. However, no signiﬁcant differences were found between the group
consuming MCT with a high dose of octanoic acid (6 g/day) and the group consuming
MCT with decanoic acid. The daily intake of MCFAs in each group was as follows: for the
decanoic acid group, octanoic acid ranged from 1.40 to 1.95 g and decanoic acid ranged from
3.47 to 4.00 g; for the high-dose octanoic acid group, octanoic acid ranged from 3.72 to 4.14 g
and decanoic acid ranged from 1.06 to 1.46 g; and for the low-dose octanoic acid group,
octanoic acid ranged from 1.24 to 1.38 g and decanoic acid ranged from 0.352 to 0.487 g. The
high-dose octanoic acid group and low-dose octanoic acid group predominantly contained
octanoic acid, while the decanoic acid group contained decanoic acid as the major fatty
acid. Although all are MCFAs, they reportedly have different physiological effects. In
studies using in vitro or type 2 diabetes model animals, a mixture of octanoic acid and
decanoic acid has shown potential to protect islet β-cell function from impairment [18].
Octanoic acid directly induced ketone body synthesis in mitochondria, while decanoic acid
promoted ketone body production in β-cells through activation of the fatty acid receptor
GPR40. It is believed that the resulting β-hydroxybutyric acid improved beta cell function
and alleviated insulin resistance.
With regard to energy supply in skeletal muscles, it has been suggested that octanoic
acid increases the supply of energy sources to muscles through ketone body production
in the liver, while decanoic acid has the potential to increase mitochondrial biogenesis
Nutrients 2023, 15, 3275
18 of 25
and energy production in skeletal muscles through the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor (PPAR), which is a fatty acid receptor. Fukazawa et al. reported an increased
protein expression of OXCT (a ketone body-utilizing enzyme) in the epitrochlearis muscle
of rats fed a ketogenic high-fat diet containing octanoic acid-dominant MCT, similar to
the fat intake of the high-dose octanoic acid food intake group in this study [75]. Similar
changes were observed in the ketogenic LCT high-fat diet group, but the OXCT expression
level was lower than that of the MCT intake group. Thus, it is inferred that octanoic acid
leads to increased ketone body production in the liver after ingestion, and these ketone
bodies are transported to the muscles through the bloodstream where they are utilized as
energy substrates. Octanoic acid has also been shown to activate ghrelin. When mice were
fed MCT composed of octanoic acid, the amount of octanoyl-ghrelin (the active form of
ghrelin) was signiﬁcantly higher compared to the control group. However, there was no
signiﬁcant difference observed between the control group and mice fed MCT composed of
decanoic acid [16]. Ghrelin strongly promotes the secretion of GH, which in turn stimulates
skeletal muscle protein synthesis through IGF-1. Administration of ghrelin to mice with
disuse muscle atrophy reportedly suppresses muscle loss in both fast-twitch and slow-
twitch muscles [76]. Additionally, in malnourished individuals with chronic respiratory
diseases, it was shown that plasma levels of active ghrelin and IGF-1 signiﬁcantly increased
after 2 weeks of daily administration of 3 g of MCT [17]. Furthermore, a correlation has
been observed between the intake of MCT (<1 g/day, 1–6 g/day, and >6 g/day) and the
levels of active ghrelin in patients with anorexia nervosa [77]. On the other hand, among
the PPAR family (which are nuclear receptors regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and
beta-oxidation, and are controlled by various fatty acids), the activation ability of PPARα
(localized in the liver) by decanoic acid is signiﬁcantly higher than that of octanoic acid [78].
Additionally, it has been demonstrated that PPARγ, which is abundant in skeletal muscle, is
directly activated by decanoic acid as a ligand [79]. In this case, even at high concentrations,
octanoic acid does not show signiﬁcant binding to PPARγ. Therefore, it is speculated that
decanoic acid primarily plays a role in the intracellular metabolism regulation of MCFAs
through PPARγ, rather than octanoic acid. Based on the above ﬁndings, it is possible
that octanoic acid and decanoic acid have the potential to improve skeletal muscle energy
utilization through different mechanisms. In this study, it appears that the effects of each
fatty acid on changes in muscle strength were comparable. As a result, it is presumed
that the changes and trends in knee extension muscle strength and grip strength were
similar between the high-dose octanoic acid food intake group and the decanoic acid food
intake group.
In this study, although the changes in knee extension muscle strength were similar
among the two groups that consumed 6 g of MCT and the group that consumed 2 g of
low-dose octanoic acid food, the changes in grip strength were different. The maximum
left-hand grip strength in the 6 g intake group showed no signiﬁcant difference compared
to the control group, but a signiﬁcant increase was observed compared to the baseline. On
the other hand, the maximum left-hand grip strength in the low-dose octanoic acid food
intake group did not show signiﬁcant changes compared to the baseline throughout the
intake period. Tsujino et al. reported that ingestion of 2 g of MCT, predominantly composed
of octanoic acid, for 2 weeks in 29 healthy individuals with an average age of 50.3 years
(17 males and 12 females) resulted in an increased rate of fatty acid oxidation during daily
activities [80]. They speculated that mitochondrial biogenesis increased and metabolism-
related enzymes were activated in the bodies of subjects who continued to consume MCT,
leading to an increase in skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation. If mitochondrial biogenesis is
increased, as in the study by Balakrishnan et al. [67], an increase in muscle strength can also
be expected. It is speculated that similar changes occurred in the bodies of the subjects in
this study, and even with a small amount of 2 g of MCT, compared to the two experiments
by Abe et al. [15,19] (which targeted older adults who were administered 6 g of MCT),
changes in knee extension muscle strength may have occurred due to the additive effect of
direct stimulation to the lower limb muscles through walking. On the other hand, the effect
Nutrients 2023, 15, 3275
19 of 25
of a small amount of MCT on the upper arm (where there is no direct exercise stimulus due
to the intervention) may be insufﬁcient to induce changes in grip strength, which is why no
signiﬁcant changes were observed.
As mentioned above, MCT did not induce changes in muscle mass in this study, and
previous evidence has also not observed favorable changes in muscle mass or lean body
mass with MCT intake, suggesting a limited effect on skeletal muscle protein metabolism.
However, there have been reports of potential effects on liver protein metabolism. Admin-
istration of MCT to protein–energy malnutrition (PEM) model animals fed a low-protein
diet resulted in enhanced protein synthesis pathways in the liver and increased liver al-
bumin levels. As a result, serum albumin levels were also higher compared to the LCT
intake group [81]. Similar effects have been observed in humans. In undernourished
long-term hospitalized patients (with an average age of 80 years) given 6 g of MCT per day
for 12 weeks, serum albumin levels increased compared to baselines and the LCT intake
group [82]. Since malnutrition is a risk factor for sarcopenia, the improvement in serum
albumin (a marker of nutritional status) is believed to contribute to reducing the risk of
sarcopenia, similar to the changes observed in muscles.
Recently, Hirabayashi et al. induced sarcopenia in model animals via low-protein
diet restriction and administration of MCT-containing food during the recovery period.
As a result, increased phosphorylation of rpS6 in the liver and tibialis anterior muscle
was observed, along with a higher muscle ﬁber protein content and cross-sectional area
compared to the group that received an LCT-containing diet during the recovery period [83].
Kimura et al. reported that in the gastrocnemius muscle of a primary sarcopenia model
animal fed with MCT, the mRNA expression of Myh3, which is involved in muscle regener-
ation from satellite cells, was signiﬁcantly higher compared to the LCT-fed group, while
the mRNA expression of Murf1 (a factor that promotes muscle breakdown in muscle cells)
was signiﬁcantly lower [84]. These ﬁndings suggest that appropriately implementing a
dietary therapy using MCT may potentially increase muscle mass, which was not observed
in the present study.
In this study, the TUG was conducted to measure walking ability. TUG is highly
correlated with lower limb strength, balance, walking ability, and ADL, and it reportedly
has good reliability and validity [20,85,86]. Moreover, it is considered beneﬁcial as a
physical function assessment tool for community health activities in older adults, and it
can also be used as a screening test to predict fall risk [87], with a cutoff value of 13.5 s
suggested as an indicator of fall risk. The decline in walking ability in older adults restricts
their mobility, leading to decreased ADL and QOL [88,89], and it is also associated with
institutionalization and mortality [29,90]. Therefore, it is important to appropriately assess
walking function for maintaining the health of older adults. In this study, while the TUG
time suggested a signiﬁcant improvement in walking ability compared to baseline in both
the MCT group and the control group, no signiﬁcant difference was detected between the
groups in terms of TUG time. This may be attributed to the fact that the control group
was also subjected to moderate-intensity walking, leading to an improvement in walking
function through enhancements in lower limb strength and balance. Similar ﬁndings
were reported by Stout et al., where the effects of dietary components were nulliﬁed by
exercise load [55]. They reported the results of two RCTs involving healthy men and
women aged 65 years and above, with one RCT not incorporating resistance training and
the other RCT incorporating resistance training. In the RCT without resistance training,
the intervention group showed signiﬁcant increases in muscle mass and muscle strength
compared to baseline after 24 weeks, while the control group showed no signiﬁcant changes.
Furthermore, when compared to the control group, the intervention group exhibited a
signiﬁcant increase in muscle strength after 24 weeks (p = 0.04). On the other hand,
in the RCT incorporating resistance training, both the control and intervention groups
showed signiﬁcant increases in muscle mass and muscle strength compared to baseline
after 24 weeks (p < 0.05), resulting in no signiﬁcant difference between the control and
intervention groups.

The results of the TUG also reﬂect balance function during walking. In this study,
although no signiﬁcant difference was observed between the groups in terms of static
balance function measurement, the effects of MCT on balance function during walking
have been reported. Mutoh et al. reported that healthy older adults with an average age of
69.8 years who consumed 18 g of MCT per day for 3 months showed improved balance
during walking compared to the control group [91]. Previous studies have demonstrated
that age-related impairment in proprioceptive sensation affects balance control during
walking [92]. When measuring brain glucose utilization in 40 healthy individuals aged 18 to
78 years, divided into eight age groups, a gradual decline in glucose utilization was reported
with increasing age [93]. Moreover, individuals with early stage dementia reportedly
show signiﬁcantly lower brain glucose utilization compared to healthy individuals [94],
suggesting that the age-related decline in brain glucose utilization may be associated with
impaired brain function, including balance control. In studies that administered MCFAs
to type 1 diabetes patients to induce cognitive impairment by forcibly lowering blood
glucose levels and intravenously administered ketone bodies to healthy individuals to
induce cognitive impairment using the same method, a signiﬁcant reduction in cognitive
impairment was observed compared to control groups that did not receive MCT or ketone
bodies [95,96]. In the study by Mutoh et al., it is possible that the MCFAs derived from the
consumed MCT directly or through the generated ketone bodies enhanced brain function
and contributed to the improvement in balance during walking. In our current study, it is
also possible that the consumed MCT enhanced brain function, thereby improving balance.
Although there was no signiﬁcant difference in the change in TUG values between the
groups in our study, the MCT group generally showed a greater decrease in the required
time and a larger improvement in walking function compared to the control group. This
may be attributed to the improvement in balance function through MCT consumption,
which is closely related to walking function, in addition to the improvement in knee
extension strength.
No adverse events attributable to the ingestion of the test foods were observed in this
study. However, adverse events related to both single-dose intake [97] and continuous
intake [98] of MCT have been reported. However, in the present study, no subjects reported
discomfort, and no adverse events related to MCT intake were observed. Based on these
ﬁndings, it was concluded that no adverse effects were manifested with the continuous
intake of MCT. Moreover, the intake rate of MCT-containing test food among the subjects
during the study period was over 98% for all subjects, indicating high acceptability in terms
of taste, ﬂavor, and other aspects, making it suitable for continuous intake over a period
of 3 months.
In this study, walking was imposed as the exercise load, which is relatively easy
to engage in. However, it is worth noting that there are many older adults who have
impairments in their lower limbs. The effects of MCT intake on muscle strength in such
individuals, when combined with different forms of exercise load, remain unknown. To
clarify the effects of MCT on age-related muscle degeneration and reduced mobility in
middle-aged and older individuals, a large-scale intervention study may be necessary.
In addition, the subjects’ residential areas were limited. This study was conducted with
healthy middle-aged and older adults living at home in urban areas. In rural areas, com-
pared to urban areas, there tends to be a smaller number of destinations (such as restaurants
and retail stores), and fewer opportunities for older adults to engage in group activities,
hobbies, sports, and so on. Furthermore, public transportation in rural areas of Japan has
fewer services and is less convenient. As a result, individuals in rural areas may have
fewer opportunities for outdoor activities. Social isolation and conﬁnement at home are
considered one of the most important risk factors associated with functional decline and
the development of mobility and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impair-
ments [99]. Tsubokawa et al. investigated the relationship between homebound status
and the surrounding environment in older adults in Niigata Prefecture, which has both
typical urban areas and mountainous rural areas in Japan. Their study demonstrated that
Nutrients 2023, 15, 3275
21 of 25
the presence of parks and sidewalks suitable for walking and exercise, more commonly
found in urban areas, could prevent the homebound status among older adults [100]. Thus,
the subjects in this study had lower physical decline compared to individuals of the same
age living in rural areas. If a similar study were conducted in suburban or rural areas
(recruiting middle-aged and older adults of similar age, activity level, and physique as
the subjects in this study), the frailty risk of that group may be different. Therefore, the
effectiveness of MCT on healthy middle-aged and older adults across Japan, including
suburban and rural areas, remains unknown.
5. Conclusions
This study revealed that the combination of moderate-intensity exercise, such as
walking, and continuous intake of MCT composed exclusively of MCFAs, is more effective
in maintaining and suppressing the decline of skeletal muscle strength compared to the
regular intake of LCT alone. In other words, it has been demonstrated that the combination
of a relatively easy-to-implement exercise therapy without resistance training and MCT
intake shows additional preventive effects. It is speculated that the action of ingested
MCFAs enhances fatty acid oxidation capacity in the muscles, resulting in increased muscle
strength compared to LCT intake, as it provides ample energy supply during muscle
activation. The increase in muscle strength through the intake of foods containing MCFAs
and the implementation of an active lifestyle contributes to the maintenance of health in
middle-aged and older adults at high risk of frailty and, consequently, achieves societal
contributions through the reduction in national medical and nursing care expenses by
extending healthy life expectancy.
