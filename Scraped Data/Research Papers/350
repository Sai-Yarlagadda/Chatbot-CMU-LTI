Abstract 
Glioma treatment remains a challenge owing to unsatisfactory targeted chemotherapy, 
where the blood–brain barrier (BBB) hinders the efficient uptake of therapeutics into 
the brain. Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formed by invasive glioma cells negatively affects 
the treatment of glioma. Herein, we developed a targeted biomimetic drug delivery 
system comprising a doxorubicin-loaded platelet membrane-coated nanogel (DOX@
PNGs). The nanogels provide great redox/pH dual responsiveness, while the platelet 
membrane (PLTM) promotes stability and circulation time. In vitro cellular uptake 
and in vivo imaging experiments demonstrated that the DOX@PNGs delivery system 
could penetrate the BBB, target gliomas, and destruct VM. DOX@PNGs increased drug 
penetration and prolonged mouse survival time during the treatment of orthotopic 
gliomas. These results indicate this biomimetic drug delivery system to be promising 
for glioma treatment and may be clinically translated in the future.

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most malignant tumour of the central nervous 
system (CNS), poses a major threat to human health owing to its late diagnosis, rapid 
progression, and ease of recurrence (Chai et al. 2017; Xue et al. 2017). Currently, surgical 
resection and postoperative chemoradiotherapy are used in the clinical setting (Kaynar 
et al., 2021; Li et al. 2021b; Weller et al. 2021). The blood–brain barrier (BBB) presents a 
major obstacle for therapeutic drugs targeting gliomas to overcome (Huang et al. 2021; 
Shi et al. 2019; Xue et al. 2017). Furthermore, the excessive use of glioma-treating drugs 
has been shown to result in systemic toxicity and drug resistance in oncological clinical 
practice (Min et al. 2022). In addition, vasculogenic mimicry (VM), which is induced by 
conditions such as hypoxia, is prevalent around solid tumours and can drive malignant 
tumour invasion (Cai et al., 2020; El Hallani et al. 2010; Ge et al. 2018). Driven by these 
circumstances, the most promising clinical strategy for improving GBM treatment is the 
development of vectors capable of effectively crossing the BBB and delivering drugs to 
block tumour angiogenesis (Weller et al. 2021).

The nanodrug delivery system (NDDS) has drawn researcher attention because of 
its potential to improve the bioavailability of therapeutic drugs (Zhang et  al. 2022). 
Nanotechnology addresses the pitfalls of standard medications in specifically targeting 
tumour tissue, where nonspecific drug action results in considerable adverse effects (Sun 
et al. 2014; Zhen et al. 2019). Nanogels are widely employed as drug carriers because 
of their ability to wrap proteins, peptides, and hydrophilic drugs (Zhou et  al. 2021). 
Many studies have reported a higher targeting efficacy by modifying peptides (Shem-
etov et al. 2012), and some researchers have produced nanogels (NGs) to effectively treat 
GBM models by integrin overexpression (Chen et al. 2017), as well as the rapid release 
of encapsulated drugs by polyethene glycolysis nanographene oxide (NGO-SS-mPEG) 
(Wen et al. 2012). However, nanomaterials are easily recognized by blood immune cells 
and activate the immune system, which presents a major challenge (Fang et al. 2018; 
Hatakeyama et al. 2011).
Bio-nanoparticles can deliver targeted effects that are precise and can evade the 
immune system through reciprocal recognition between cells (Gu et al. 2021) originat-
ing from cancer cells (Chen et al., 2017; Pereira-Silva et al. 2020), red blood cells (Fang 
et al. 2018; Lin et al. 2023), and platelets (Gu et al. 2021; Jiang et al. 2020; Li et al. 2021a). 
Jiang et al. reported that bio-nanoparticles  (Fe3O4-SAS@PLT) could significantly boost 
cancer cell clearance and immunogenicity, suggesting a strong potential for inhibition 
of tumour metastasis (Jiang et al. 2020). Zhang et al. synthesized neutrophil membrane-
encapsulated nanoparticles for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and showed that it 
greatly reduced synovial inflammation and acted as a joint protector (Zhang et al. 2018).
Platelets are derived from megakaryocytes, and following the appearance of a wound, 
they congregate near the injured blood vessels, producing substances that aid in the pre-
vention of bleeding (Koupenova et al. 2019). It has been verified that CD62P expressed 
on the platelet membrane (PLTM) surface aids in targeting tumours, while another 
important component, CD47, plays a vital role in preventing nanomaterials from being 
removed by the innate immune system (Fang et al. 2018; Li et al. 2021a). Diana et al. ver-
ified that CD47 on PLTM could assist nanoparticles in evading immune system attack 
(Dehaini et al., 2017). In our previous study, we reported that platelets have a range of 
adjuvant effects in anti-tumour therapy, especially in tumour targeting and immune 
escape (Wu et al. 2021).
In this study, we developed a strategy using doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded redox/pH 
dual-responsive NG (DOX@PNGs) to target orthotopic glioblastoma and increase ther-
apeutic efficacy of DOX. The functional drug delivery system was localized to glioma 
sites via interactions with membrane surface proteins and quickly released DOX when 
the tumour microenvironment was responsively stimulated. According to the in  vivo 
tests, DOX@PNGs exhibited great targeting effects and increased survival time. This 
method could be applied to a variety of disorders and is a promising strategy for future 
clinical use.
Materials and methods
Materials
The rat C6 cell line, mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line (HT22), and human mono-
cytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1) were purchased from CAS Cell Bank; the PRP was

Li et al. Cancer Nanotechnology           (2023) 14:12 
 
obtained from the rats; and the BALB/c nude mice and rats were obtained from Shang-
hai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. Doxorubicin hydrochloride, mannitol, sucrose, 
tris-HCL,  MgCl2, KCL, paraformaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 5-chloro-
2-formylphenylboronic acid (2-FPBA), sodium alginate (SA), ethylene imine polymer 
(PEI), acetone, Matrigel basement membrane matrix, and phorbol myristate acetate 
(PMA) were all obtained from Sigma Aldrich. The protease inhibitor cocktail was pro-
cured from Biomake, Shanghai. The BCA protein assay, CCK8 assay, JC-1 assay, and 
Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kits were supplied by Beyotime, China. Foetal 
bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin–streptomycin were purchased from Gibco, USA. 
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute 
(RPMI 1640) were obtained from Hyclone, Shanghai. Cy5-NHS dye was obtained from 
Solarbio, China. The rabbit anti-GAPDH, rabbit anti-MMP-2, rabbit anti-MMP-9, anti-
CD47, and anti-CD62P antibodies were obtained from Hua Bio, China.
Synthesis of DOX‑loaded NGs
The NGs used in this study were synthesised as follows (Xu et al. 2021). First, 3.28 mg of 
2-FPBA and 15.32 mg of PEI were dissolved in 1 mL of PBS overnight at 25 °C. There-
after, 5.6 mL of n-hexane was added to a clean 10-mL glass sample bottle, followed by 
the addition of 350 μL of Brij30 and an immediate 1 min vortex. Subsequently, 20 μL 
of 0.5% wt SA, 100  μL of DOX (6  mg/mL), and 80  μL of 2-FPBA/PEI mixture were 
added sequentially and swirled for 1 min after the addition of each reagent. The sample 
was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1.5–2.0 h, after which 3 mL of acetone 
was added slowly along the wall of the bottle. Red sediment appeared at the bottom as 
DOX-loaded NGs, while bare NGs were white; in rapid sequence, the bottle was gen-
tly inclined, and the supernatant was carefully absorbed. Finally, the sample bottle was 
vacuumized for 2 h.
Extraction of PLTM from PRP
The PRP was obtained from rats, and the procedure was executed as described in a pre-
vious study (Wu et al. 2021). Briefly, the PRP was transferred into a clean EP tube and 
centrifuged at 100 xg for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully pipetted into 
a clean EP tube. After centrifugation at 800 xg for 20 min at 4 °C, the precipitate was 
retained and a cell lysate buffer (25 mM sucrose, 75 mM mannitol, 1 mM KCl, 10 mM 
Tris/HCl, 1 mM  MgCl2) containing protease inhibitors (100 ×) was added; the solution 
was kept on ice for 15 min to fully lyse the platelet cells. The cell lysate was repeatedly 
freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen and a 37 °C water bath five times, after which it was 
broken by an ultrasonic probe for 5 s, which was repeated 5 times at 5 s intervals. The 
entire process was carried out on ice to avoid high temperatures caused by the ultra-
sound, which could damage the proteins on the cell membrane. The PLTM precipitate 
was obtained by centrifugation at 21,000 xg for 10 min at 4 °C and stored in a − 20 °C 
freezer.
Preparation and characterization of PNGs
We mixed 1 mg of NGs with 2 ×  108/L of PLTM sediment, and a liposome extruder was 
used to extrude a 200 nm polycarbonate membrane five times; PLTM-coated NGs were 
Page 4 of 17
Li et al. Cancer Nanotechnology           (2023) 14:12 
then obtained. The size and zeta potential of the NGs, PLTMs, and PNGs were analysed 
by dynamic light scattering (DLS; Malvern, Zetasizer Nano S90, Malvern, UK), and their 
morphological characteristics were examined by 200 kV TEM.
The surface protein distribution of PLTMs and PNGs was assessed using Coomas-
sie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. Briefly, the prepared PLTMs and PNGs were fully 
fragmented using an ultrasonic disruptor; then, the protein concentrations of the two 
samples were determined using the BCA Protein Quantitation Kit, and the samples 
containing SDS–PAGE loading buffer were boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Next, 10 μL of 
each sample was added to the prepared 4–12% gel wells. After electrophoresis, the pro-
teins were stained with CBB staining solution for approximately 30 min and the gel was 
washed with a highly concentrated decolourising solution until the gel became transpar-
ent. Finally, photographs were taken and recorded. Similarly, the expression of PLTM 
and PNGs surface membrane proteins (CD62P and CD47) was determined by western 
blotting.
In Vitro drug release
DOX release from the drug-loaded NGs was examined using the dialysis method. First, 
dialysis bags (MWCO = 3 kDa) with 6 mg of DOX@NGs were placed into 50 mL centri-
fuge tubes containing 30 mL of different release media (GSH concentration of 1.0 and 
10.0 mM; pH = 5.0, 6.0, or 7.4). The centrifuge tubes were shaken at 37 °C and 100 rpm, 
and the liquid in the tubes was removed at specified times (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 
24 h) and replenished with the same volume of the corresponding media. Finally, the 
absorbance of DOX was measured at 480 nm.
In Vitro cellular uptake and immune escape
The phagocytosis efficiency of nano-formulations in C6 cells and macrophages was 
assessed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. C6 cells at a density of 1 ×  105 cells 
per well were seeded onto 24-well plates containing cell slides and incubated for 24 h. 
THP-1 cells in a culture medium containing 100 ng/PMA, which induces THP-1 mono-
cyte differentiation into macrophages, were incubated on well plates in the same man-
ner. The cell medium was then replaced with DOX, DOX@NGs, or DOX@PNGs at a 
final DOX concentration of 5 μg/mL. After incubation for 4 h, the cells were digested 
with trypsin into a single-cell suspension, and fluorescence was quantified by flow 
cytometry (FC500, Beckman Coulter, USA). The cell slide was washed twice with PBS, 
fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min, and washed three times with PBS. 
Subsequently, the cells were stained with 0.5 μg/mL DAPI for 15 min and washed three 
times with PBS. Finally, the slides were sealed with an anti-fluorescent bursting agent 
and photographed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM; Leica, Germany).
Apoptosis and JC‑1 assay
Apoptosis and the JC-1 assay were measured using flow cytometry and fluorescence 
microscopy to further detect the inhibition efficiency of the drug on C6 cells. Briefly, 
C6 cells were seeded at a density of 5 ×  105 cells/well in 6-well plates. After incubation 
for 24 h, the medium was replaced with DOX, DOX@NGs, DOX@PNGs, or DMEM 
for another 24 h. Immediately, the cells were collected using trypsin and centrifuged at 
Page 5 of 17
Li et al. Cancer Nanotechnology           (2023) 14:12 
 
200 xg for 3 min. Subsequently, the cells were stained according to the Annexin V-FITC/
PI apoptosis kit or JC-1 assay kit, and mitochondrial damage and apoptosis of C6 cells 
were detected by flow cytometry, respectively (FC500, Beckman Coulter, USA). The data 
were analysed using FlowJo 7.6 software. In addition, we captured a fluorescence graph 
of JC-1 using microscopy.
In Vitro BBB model assay
We used the Transwell model to simulate the BBB in vitro. b End.3 cells were spread in 
Transwell chambers at 1 ×  105 cells per well, incubated at 37 ℃ on a shaker at 50 rpm, 
and protected from light; the fluorescence content of each group was then analysed by 
confocal microscopy and flow cytometry 24 h after incubation.
In Vitro destruction of VM
Fifty microlitres of Matrigel was pre-capped in 96-well plates and incubated for 30 min 
at 37 ℃. C6 cells (1 ×  104 cells per well) were suspended in an FBS-free medium contain-
ing DOX, DOX@NGs, or DOX@PNGs at a DOX concentration of 5 μg/mL and seeded 
into a well plate. After incubation for 8–10 h, photographs were captured by microscopy. 
The percentage of tube formation was quantified using Image Pro Plus software version 
6.0.
Western blotting
C6 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 ×  105 cells per well and allowed to 
reach 60% confluence. The medium was then replaced with FBS-free DMEM containing 
DOX@PNGs and control formulations. After 24 h of incubation, the plate was washed 
three times with PBS after the liquid was removed. Cell lysate (RIPA:PMSF = 50:1) was 
added to the wells and the plates were placed on ice for 20 min, after which they were 
fully scraped using a spatula. The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime) 
was used for quantitative detection. A 12% SDS–PAGE gel was loaded with 20 μg of pro-
tein samples from each group; the protein was separated by electrophoresis at 80 V fol-
lowed by 120 V and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, 
which was blocked in 5% skim milk for 1 h. The PVDF membrane was subsequently 
washed with TBST (0.5% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline) and incubated with the 
primary antibody according to its recommended dilution at 4 °C overnight. The mem-
branes were washed three times with TBST and incubated with an HRP-labelled sec-
ondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the membranes were imaged using 
Immobilon Western HRP substrate (Millipore, USA) on a Bio-Rad Chemioc MP system 
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA).
In Vivo anti‑tumour efficacy
C6 glioma-bearing mice were established as previously described. At 7 days after model 
establishment, mice were randomly divided into four groups (saline, DOX, DOX@
NGs, and DOX@PNGs) of 10 mice each; mice treated with saline were used as con-
trols. Each of the above agents (at a dose of 2.5 mg DOX/kg) was injected every 3 days 
for a total of five injections. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 μL of lucif-
erase at a concentration of 15 mg/mL and anaesthetised with isoflurane 10 min after 
Page 6 of 17
Li et al. Cancer Nanotechnology           (2023) 14:12 
injection. Subsequently, tumour volume changes were observed using the NIR fluo-
rescence imaging system IVIS III (PerkinElmer, USA) at 7, 10, 13, 16, and 19 days after 
modelling. Overall survival was managed, and the weight was recorded every other day. 
At 1 day after the last dose, three mice were randomly selected from each group, and 
blood was obtained from their eyes for analysis of blood biochemical parameters (ALT, 
AST, CREA, and urea) using a fully automated biochemical analyser (AU5800, Beck-
man Coulter). The brains and major organs were subjected to HE staining, IHC stain-
ing (Ki67, Caspase 3, CD34-PAS double staining), and TUNEL. The survival time of the 
remaining mice was observed until death.
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism 8 software (San Diego, CA, USA) was used for statistical analysis of 
the experimental results. The diversity between groups was analysed using an unpaired 
t test. The results of more than three independent repeated experiments were expressed 
as the mean ± SD. The overall survival was compared using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) 
test. P < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 were considered statistically significant and are denoted as 
*, **, and ***, respectively (Scheme 1).

Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization of DOX@PNGs
Recently, bio-nanoparticles have received increasing attention due to their excellent 
biological activity. Among the various membrane biomaterials, PLTMs, given their 
multitude of interactions with other cell types, have attracted much attention due to 
their significant tumour targeting and immune escape potential (Wang et al. 2023; Yu 
et al. 2022). In this study, we aimed to leverage these unique abilities to design a pH/
glutathione (GSH) dual-responsive bio-nanogel delivery system (Xu et  al. 2021). The 
PLTM fragment was isolated from rats’ platelet rich plasma (PRP) through differential 
centrifugation and freeze–thaw processes and then coated onto an NG core. The sizes of 
the NGs, PLTMs, and PLTM-coated NGs (PNGs) were 92.07 ± 0.95 nm, 174.3 ± 2.7 nm, 
and 119.1 ± 1.2 nm, respectively (Fig. 1A, B). The zeta potentials of the NGs, PLTMs,

and PNGs were 10.06 ± 0.04  mV, −  14.9 ± 0.6  mV, and −  16.5 ± 0.4  mV, respectively 
(Fig. 1C). The NGs of PNGs was approximately 120 nm in size, which can easily be taken 
up into glioma cells [30]. In the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, the 
NGs appeared spherical and regularly sized in morphometric terms (Fig. 1D), while con-
jugation with the PLTM increased the NG size and decreased the zeta potential.
Sodium salt-–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) was performed to 
assess the protein expression of PNGs and PLTM. There was no significant change in 
protein expression between PNGs and PLTMs (Fig. 1J), suggesting the PLTM was suc-
cessfully coted on the NGs. CD62P and CD47 were expressed on the membrane sur-
face of PNGs, as determined by western blotting (Fig. 1E), indicating that PLTM surface 
protein was not affected throughout the production process. CD62P (P-selectin) has 
been reported to closely interact with tumour cell membranes (Jiang et al. 2020; Li et al. 
2021a). CD47 is responsible for binding to SIRPα on the surface of macrophages, which 
protects nano-agents from immune system attack (Fang et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2020). 
In addition, the NGs remained stable in a 10% FBS medium for 1 week at 37 °C (Addi-
tional file 1: Fig. S1). The size of the NGs did not change significantly over time. Finally, 
we exposed the NGs to various GSH concentrations (1 mM and 10 mM) and pH values 
(5.0 and 6.0). When the NGs were stimulated with high concentrations of GSH and low 
pH, the particle size changed significantly (Fig. 1F, G), which was superior to the previ-
ously described nano-delivery system with a single stimulus (Wu et al. 2022; Zheng et al. 
2022). Moreover, the sustained-release behaviour of DOX from DOX@PNGs may pro-
long drug action time and enhance antitumour efficacy (Fig. 1H, I).
Evaluation of cellular uptake and immune escape
The cellular uptake of different formulations in C6 cells was used to assess the ability 
of nano-agents to be deposited around glioma cells and was assessed by fluorescence 
microscopy and flow cytometry. The confocal findings showed that DOX@NGs and 
DOX@PNGs had enhanced tumour cell uptake efficiency compared to the free drug 
DOX (Fig. 2A, C) in a time-dependent manner (Additional file 1: Fig. S3). Furthermore, 
DOX@PNGs showed the highest fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry (Fig.  2B). 
Our results demonstrated that PLTMs enhanced the targeting ability of NGs in C6 cells. 
Considering the enhanced immune escapability of PNGs with macrophages in vitro, we 
co-incubated macrophages with different drugs (DOX, DOX@NGs, and DOX@PNGs) 
for 4 h to detect the NGs’ ability to avoid immune cell clearance. Both confocal and 
flow cytometry revealed that DOX@PNGs were better able to evade immune clearance 
(Fig. 2D–F). These findings suggest that the PLTM has a protective effect in NGs via spe-
cific surface proteins, which are homologous to blood cells (Jiang et al. 2020; Wu et al. 
2021).
in vitro killing efficacy of glioma cells
We assessed the inhibitory effects of the different formulations on C6 cells using the 
CCK8 assay. First, the tests showed that polymers with low toxicity retained more than 
90% of live cells at doses of 20–100 μg/mL for both bare NGs and PNGs (Additional 
file  1: Fig. S2A). We then co-incubated different preparations with C6 cells at a final 
concentration of 5 μg/mL DOX for 24 h. Compared with the control group, the DOX@
Page 9 of 17
Li et al. Cancer Nanotechnology           (2023) 14:12 
 
PNGs group had much lower cell viability at all doses—particularly at 20 μg/mL, where 
cell viability was less than 20%—indicating significantly improved antitumour activity 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S2B). We further demonstrated the ability of different agents to 
induce apoptosis using the Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay. The percentage 
of early- and late-stage apoptosis in the DOX@PNGs group was 35.03%, whereas that 
in the other groups was less than 10% (Fig. 3A, C). In addition, we used the JC-1 assay 
to assess the capacity of each treatment group to cause mitochondrial damage. Normal 
mitochondria emit intense red fluorescence; in contrast, unhealthy mitochondria fluo-
resce green due to a decrease in membrane potential (Ruan et al. 2019). C6 cells treated 
with DOX@PNGs showed significantly more green fluorescence signals (Fig.  3B, E). 
There was a significant difference in the JC-1 monomer/polymer fluorescence ratio in 
the DOX@PNGs group compared to the DOX and DOX@NGs groups (Fig. 3D). The 
above experiments show that PLTM-modified drug-loaded NGs have stronger cytotoxic 
effects.
in vitro and in vivo BBB penetration
The BBB greatly hinders the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to brain tumours 
in situ (Xue et al. 2017). To investigate the BBB penetration ability of different nano

formulations, we constructed an in vitro BBB model using vascular endothelial cells. 
Confocal images showed red fluorescence around C6 cells in the DOX@PNGs group, 
while there was a low fluorescence intensity of free DOX; this further confirmed the 
inability of DOX to cross the BBB (Fig. 4C, E). The flow cytometry results demon-
strated that the BBB permeability of DOX@PNGs was 36.4%, which was significantly 
higher than that of DOX (Fig. 4B). The fluorescence intensity of DOX@PNGs was also 
significantly stronger than the DOX and the DOX@NGs, indicating its remarkable 
BBB penetration ability.
Furthermore, we used Cy5-stained NGs to demonstrate the in vivo BBB penetra-
tion and targeting abilities of the PNGs using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS). By 
tail vein injection of different agents (Cy5, Cy5-NGs, and Cy5-PNGs), we obtained 
a fluorescence distribution photo at the expected time (Additional file 1: Fig. S4A). 
Cy5-PNGs showed a strong fluorescent signal in the brain 1 h after injection, reach-
ing a maximum at 6 h, while partial fluorescence could still be detected after 24 h. In 
contrast, the fluorescence intensity of free Cy5 and Cy5-NGs reached its maximum 
at 3 h post-injection, and both were lower than that of Cy5-PNGs, especially Cy5. We 
hypothesized that CD62P on the PLTM could pass through the BBB, which allowed 
the fluorescence intensity of Cy5-PNGs to reach its maximum 6 h after injection and

then gradually decrease. The isolated organ fluorescence map showed that the flu-
orescence intensity of Cy5-PNGs was 2.3 times that of Cy5 and 1.64 times that of 
Cy5-NGs after 24 h (Fig. 4D, F), and fluorescence semi-quantitative analysis showed 
a significant difference between the groups (Additional file 1: Figure S4B, C). in vitro 
and in  vivo BBB penetrating assays revealed that the constructed biomimetic NGs 
could target tumours effectively.
Destruction of vasculogenic mimicry (VM)
The aggressive nature of tumours is inextricably linked to the abundance of surrounding 
blood supply. We used a previously reported stromal gel model to assess the ability of 
DOX@PNGs to inhibit VM in C6 cells (Ruan et al. 2019). After 10 h, untreated C6 cells 
quickly formed vascular-like channels at the bottom of the well plates. In contrast, the 
cells treated with DOX@PNGs had only a small fraction of vascular-like channels, and 
sometimes none (Fig. 5B, D). This indicates that DOX@PNGs can effectively inhibit VM 
in glioma cells. To investigate the molecular mechanism of VM destruction, the expres-
sion levels of VM-related indicators, such as matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and 
matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), were determined by western blotting (Fig. 5C). 
After treatment with different formulations for 24 h, the expression levels of MMP-2 and 
MMP-9 were downregulated in C6 cells compared to those in untreated cells. In particu-
lar, C6 cells treated with DOX@PNGs showed the lowest indicator protein expression, 
indicating that DOX@PNGs could efficiently downregulate indicator protein expression

in C6 cells. However, the VM-destruction effect of DOX is probably due to its cyto-
toxicity. These evidences indicate that our prepared biomimetic delivery system could 
effectively inhibit the formation of glioma vasculogenic mimicry, which is significant for 
enhancing chemotherapeutic effects.
in vivo antitumour efficacy
The in vivo antitumour efficacy of biomimetic NGs was evaluated in an orthotopic glioma-
bearing mouse model. Haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining (Fig. 6E) of the brain showed 
that the tumour cells in the saline group were close, numerous, and tightly arranged, with 
darkly stained nuclei. In addition, the tumour tissue treated with free DOX and DOX@
NGs was loosely arranged, while the DOX@PNGs group had the most sparsely arranged 
tumour cells, indicating that the DOX@PNGs possessed the highest inhibitory effect. We 
also performed immunohistochemical (IHC) staining (Fig. 6E) of brain tissue to investigate 
the expression of proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (caspase 3 and CC3) markers in differ-
ent groups of glioma-bearing mice. The DOX@PNGs group exhibited the highest apoptosis

rate compared with the saline, free DOX, and DOX@NGs groups. In addition, Ki67 expres-
sion in mice treated with DOX-PNGs was remarkably decreased. A glioma model was con-
structed using Luc-C6 cells to image brain tumours using chemiluminescence (Fig. 6B).

Mice treated with DOX@PNGs had the smallest tumour volumes, revealing its valuable 
antitumour effect. These results confirm the superiority and therapeutic efficacy of the 
targeted modified biomimetic NGs. Finally, we performed transferase-mediated dUTP-
biotin nick end labelling (TUNEL) to assess tumour tissue apoptosis, which showed that 
the green fluorescence intensity was stronger in the DOX@PNG group than in the other 
formulations (Fig. 6E), indicating significant apoptosis of glioma cells in mice treated with 
DOX@PNGs. PAS-CD34 double staining illustrated the vigorous VM inhibition effect of 
the DOX@PNGs group, which was consistent with the results of previous experiments. 
Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed that DOX@PNGs significantly prolonged the lifes-
pan of mice (Fig.  6D). The median survival time (MST) was significantly longer in the 
DOX@PNGs group (34.5 days) than in the saline (23 days), DOX (27 days), and DOX@
NGs (31 days) groups. These results suggested that DOX@PNGs had the best anti-glioma 
activity, with significant tumour growth inhibition in all groups (Fig. 6C); this may be attrib-
uted to BBB penetration resulting in drug aggregation at the tumour site. DOX@NGs also 
showed slightly better tumour suppression than free DOX but were much less effective 
than DOX@PNGs, suggesting a weak antitumour effect due to poor targeting ability. On 
the other hand, the poor performance of free DOX was presumably due to its inability to 
penetrate the BBB. Overall, the anti-tumour activity of DOX@PNGs was found to be out-
standing through both in vitro and in vivo assessments.
in vivo safety
The biosafety of the nano-formulations was assessed by histopathology and blood analysis. 
HE staining (Fig. 7A) showed no significant difference between tissues from mice treated 
with DOX@PNGs and normal mice. In contrast, mice treated with DOX exhibited myocar-
dial fibrous disruption, alveolar wall thickening, and inflammatory cell infiltration, which is 
consistent with the side effects of DOX. In addition, the haematological parameters of mice 
treated with DOX@PNGs were relatively stable compared with those of the other treat-
ment groups. Blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), creatinine (CR), and uric acid (UA) showed that DOX caused mild liver and nephro-
toxicity (Fig. 7B–E). However, encapsulation with PLTMs ameliorated the hepatic and renal 
toxicity induced by DOX, owing to the ability of DOX@PNGs to target glioma sites, release 
the drug rapidly, and reduce the nonspecific aggregation of the drug in the organs in vivo. 
We also found that DOX@NGs exhibited slightly higher hepatorenal toxicity than DOX@
PNGs, which we speculate is due to the lack of PLTM modification, resulting in the inability 
to specifically target the tumour site with the drug, leading to relatively more drug distri-
bution to the liver and kidney tissues. Thus, these results confirm that DOX@PNGs have 
relatively little effect on liver and kidney function in mice. Our study confirmed that DOX@
PNGs have good biocompatibility in living organisms, do not cause side effects in normal 
tissues, and can be safely applied in biological experiments.
Conclusions
In summary, we developed a biomimetic NG by leveraging PLTMs, which has 
strong anti-glioma effects and could effectively cross the BBB and destruct VM in 
glioma therapy. The enhanced tumour reaction of DOX@PNGs is mainly mediated 
by CD62P–CD44 on the surface of PLTMs both in vitro and in vivo. This research
