............................................................................................................ 10 \\n6\\n1 Welcome \\nWelcome to the Language Technologies Institute, Master of \\nComputational Data Science Program. While this handbook is specific to \\nyour academic experience in the department, there are several other \\nresources and offices graduate students are encouraged to consult during \\ntheir tenure at Carnegie Mellon University. Information about The Word, \\nthe student handbook, the Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs, the \\nOffice of the Dean of Students, and others are included in Appendix A of \\nthis handbook. \\n1.1 The MCDS Degree \\nThe MCDS Degree The Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) \\ndegree is a professional Master of Science degree offered by the Language \\nTechnologies Institute (LTI), a department in the School of Computer \\nScience at Carnegie Mellon University. The MCDS degree offers students \\nwith a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with \\nadvanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to \\nstudents with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics, \\nprogramming, and logical reasoning. An undergraduate degree in \\nComputer Science is not required. Most students will complete the \\nprogram in three semesters; students coming from other disciplines and \\nstudents focus on developing applied research skills in preparation for \\nfurther graduate study or research-oriented employment may require an \\nadditional fourth semester. \\n\", \"The MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations; \\nstudents entering the program enroll in core courses in their first \\nsemester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration \\n(see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in \\nconsultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad \\nguidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given \\nconcentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program \\nis typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a \\nrequired Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical \\ntraining. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the \\nLTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in \\n7\\ncorporate research and development laboratories. \\nThe program consists entirely of coursework and a Capstone Project, and \\nno Master’s Thesis is required. All Capstone projects are structured as \\nresearch activities and may lead to a publication. There is no Doctoral \\nprogram in Computational Data Science. Because of the highly selective \\nnature of the MCDS program and quality of the MCDS curriculum, \\nperforming well in the program will give a boost to a PhD application. MS \\ngraduates are welcome to apply to CMU PhD programs but will not receive \\npreferential treatment. \\nThere are significant differences between CMU's different departments \\nand degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies and \\nregulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate \\nstudents of their program requirements and procedures and ensures that \\nstudents have written access to the standard information outlined below. \\nThis handbook describes the policies, procedures, and requirements for \\nthe Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) degree. \\nAll policies not explicitly described in this document conform to School of \\nComputer Science (SCS) policies and university policies described in The \\nWord, Carnegie Mellon University Student Handbook and at the \\nUniversity Policies website. \\n1.2 Vision \\nCarnegie Mellon University will have a transformative impact on society \\nthrough continual innovation in education, research, creativity, and \\nentrepreneurship. \\n1.3 Mission \\nTo create a transformative educational experience for students focused on \\ndeep disciplinary knowledge; problem solving; leadership, \\ncommunication, and interpersonal skills; and personal health and well-\\nbeing. \\nTo cultivate a transformative university community committed to (a) \\nattracting and retaining diverse, world-class talent; (b) creating a \\ncollaborative environment open to the free exchange of ideas, where \\n\", '8\\nresearch, creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship can flourish; and \\n(c) ensuring individuals can achieve their full potential. \\nTo impact society in a transformative way — regionally, nationally, and \\nglobally — by engaging with partners outside the traditional borders of the \\nuniversity campus. \\n1.4 MCDS Contact Information \\nThe people responsible for administering the MCDS degree are: \\nJennifer M Lucas \\nAcademic Program Manager \\nMaster of Computational Data Science  \\nLanguage Technologies Institute \\nSchool of Computer Science  \\nCarnegie Mellon University \\nGates-Hillman Center 6415 \\n5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 \\nPhone: (412) 268-9870 \\nFax: (412) 268-7287 \\nCarolyn Penstein Rosé, Director \\nMaster of Computational Data Science  \\nLanguage Technologies Institute \\nSchool of Computer Science \\nCarnegie Mellon University \\nGates-Hillman Center 5419 \\n5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 \\nPhone: (412) 268-4525 \\nFax: (412) 268-7287 \\nRobert Frederking \\nGraduate Program Chair \\nLanguage Technologies Institute \\nSchool of Computer Science  \\nCarnegie Mellon University \\nGates-Hillman Center 6515 \\n5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 \\nPhone: (412) 268-6656 \\nMona Diab, LTI Director \\nLanguage Technologies Institute \\nSchool of Computer Science  \\nCarnegie Mellon University \\nGates-Hillman Center 5723 \\n5000 Forbes Avenue, Pgh, PA 15213 \\nPhone: (412) 268-3669 \\nThe Language Technologies Institute is located primarily on the 5 th and 6th floors of the \\nGates Hillman Complex (GHC) on Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus: \\nLanguage Technologies Institute \\nCarnegie Mellon University \\n5000 Forbes Avenue \\nGates Hillman Complex 5402, LTI \\nPittsburgh, PA 15241-3891 \\n412-268-6591 (phone) \\n412-268-6298 (fax) \\nhttp://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/ \\n9\\n1.5 University Policies and Expectations \\nEach member of the Carnegie Mellon community must be familiar with university \\npolicies and guidelines.

The \\nTitle IX \\n\", '10\\ncoordinator may be reached at 412-268-7125 or tix@cmu.edu. \\n1.7 The Carnegie Mellon Code \\nStudents at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community \\ndedicated to the achievement of excellence, are expected to meet the highest standards \\nof \\npersonal, ethical and moral conduct possible. \\nThese standards require personal integrity, a commitment to honesty without \\ncompromise, as well as truth without equivocation and a willingness to place the good of \\nthe community above the good of the self. Obligations once undertaken must be met, \\ncommitments kept. \\nAs members of the Carnegie Mellon community, individuals are expected to uphold the \\nstandards of the community in addition to holding others accountable for said standards. \\nIt is \\nrare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not \\naffect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. \\nThe discovery, advancement and communication of knowledge are not possible without \\na \\ncommitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the \\ncreativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit for prior \\nknowledge. Without the ability to trust that these principles will be observed, an \\nacademic community cannot exist. \\nThe commitment of its faculty, staff and students to these standards contributes to the \\nhigh \\nrespect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is held. Students must not destroy that \\nrespect by their failure to meet these standards. Students who cannot meet them should \\nvoluntarily \\nwithdraw from the university. \\nThe Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found on-line at: \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/. \\n2 The Language Technologies Institute \\n2.1 Main Office \\nThe Gates Hillman Complex: Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other departmental \\nresources are in GHC 5404. \\n11\\n2.2 Photocopies and Printers \\nThe use of a printer/copier requires a CS user id (see the ‘Computers’ section). The School \\nof Computer Science provides several black-and-white and color printers for use by \\nstudents. SCS Computing Facilities maintains a list of printers:  \\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~help/printing/. \\n2.3 Office Space for MS Students \\nFull-time students in the LTI’s MS degree programs on the Pittsburgh campus have \\naccess to a shared working space to create a sense of community and provide space for \\nworking when on campus. \\n2.4 Computers for MS Students \\nStudents are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access \\nuniversity resources and complete course assignments. Laptops running Windows, \\nMacOS, and Linux software are all acceptable. \\n', 'MS students will be given a CS user id. A CS user id is required to use the LTI computer \\ncluster, department printers, and other SCS services. The School of Computer Science \\nhas a Help Center located at 4203 GHC. They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu, \\nextension 8-4231 from a campus phone, or 412-268-4231 from an outside line. \\nMS students will be given access to the LTI’s computer cluster on an as-needed basis, to \\nbe used for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project. The \\nLTI cluster provides storage and computation for projects involving large datasets and/or \\nlengthy computation.  \\n3 MCDS Degree Completion and Certification  \\nThis section describes the various rules and regulations that determine the attainment of \\na MCDS degree by the student. \\n3.1 CMU Degree Completion and Statute of Limitations \\nCarnegie Mellon graduate students are expected to complete their degree requirements \\nwithin the standard length of time for their program of study as outlined in the relevant \\nGraduate Student Handbook. Standard program lengths for graduate students vary \\nsignificantly – ranging from two semesters for some full-time master’s programs to \\nseveral or more years for doctoral programs. Upon completion of the graduate program \\ndegree requirements, the degree will be certified by the student’s academic program in \\nthe semester in which the student completes the requirements. \\nEarly Completion \\nGraduate students who consider the completion of all degree requirements in less than \\nthe standard length of time for their program of study may consult with their degree-\\n12\\ngranting program or department to determine if early degree certification is allowed and \\nunder what circumstances. \\nExtended or Longer-than-Standard Completion \\nLonger-than-standard degree completion may occur due to academic interruptions in \\nmaking progress toward the degree as defined by the academic program, interruptions \\nof full-time study or progress towards the degree due to serious, documented medical \\nissues, or other unusual or unforeseen circumstances. Master’s students who require \\nlonger than the standard time to complete their degree requirements are expected to \\nremain in close contact with their graduate program and will be certified at the end of the \\nsemester in which they have completed their degree requirements.  \\nPolicy on Master’s Student Statute of Limitations \\nwww.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-\\nlimitations.html  \\n', 'See the above link regarding guidelines and restrictions which place an upper limit on \\nthe maximum length of time allowable for master’s degree completion and certification. \\nAdditional Guidance for Students \\nProgram of study. Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree \\nrequirements should consult with their academic advisor and/or appropriate associate \\ndean. \\nFinancial aid and student account \\nStudents are expected to make normal progress toward their degree to graduate within \\nthe standard timeframe for their program of study. Under U.S. Federal Title IV \\nregulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent upon enrollment in \\nand successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their current \\ndegree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they \\nmay be eligible, students must enroll each semester in at least 36 units that count toward \\ntheir current degree level. (See separate guidance regarding integrated degree \\ncompletion.) Students should consult with their designated college liaison in The HUB \\nregarding billing and financial aid, particularly for early completion, longer-than-\\nstandard completion, or integrated undergraduate and master’s degree programs. \\nInternational students  \\nImmigration status for students in F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is tied to making \\nnormal progress toward completing degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 \\nstudents who are considering completing their degree requirements early, anticipating \\nlonger-than-standard completion, or moving from an undergraduate to a graduate \\nstudent classification (integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should consult with \\ntheir designated advisor in the Office of International Education (OIE) to ensure \\ncompliance with immigration regulations. \\n13\\n3.2 Full-time Status \\nAll MCDS students are expected to enroll full-time (at present, there is no option to pursue \\nthe degree as a part-time student). To be considered a full-time student, a student must \\nbe registered for, and complete, a minimum of 36 units in every Fall and Spring semester. \\nAll international students are required by US Federal law to maintain full-time status. \\nStudents can have no more than one (1) remote course counting toward the 36 units used \\nto satisfy full-time enrollment. Failure to maintain full-time status will result in loss of a \\nstudent visa (and, therefore, “permit of stay”). All students having a Stafford Loan are \\nrequired to maintain full-time status. \\n', \"3.3 MCDS Degree Enrollment Process and Related Information \\n3.3.1 Duration of the degree program \\nThe MCDS degree must be completed within five (5) years from the time that the student \\nmatriculates into the program. \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-\\nlimitations.html \\nAs outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations (see link above), students will \\ncomplete all requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven years from \\noriginal matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more restrictive \\ndepartment, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the \\nperson may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently \\noffered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program. \\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, \\nfamily or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the \\nrelevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or \\ndesignate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that \\ninterruption. Students who are pursuing a master’s degree as part-time students for all \\nsemesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their \\nprogram or department for extension of the time to degree limit. \\n3.3.2 Residency requirements \\nThere is no formal residence requirement. However, most courses in the program are \\ntaught on campus without an option for distance education. Students enrolled in in-\\nperson course sections (IPR) are expected to attend all class meetings in person. \\n3.3.3 Degree Certification: Course requirements and related policies/protocols \\n14\\n\\uf0b7 \\nIn order to receive the MCDS degree, students must have a Quality Point Average \\n(QPA) of 3.0. Completion of the degree is based on completing courses in the core \\ncurriculum, the MCDS seminar, electives and capstone project. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe capstone project consists of students working at CMU on a research project, \\nor on an industry-sponsored project. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe student must complete 144 eligible units of study. This includes eight core and \\nconcentration courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and two 12-unit capstone \\ncourses. All students complete a common MCDS core in their first two semesters, \\nconsisting of five courses. All students must also complete at least one \\nconcentration, consisting of three courses in one of three areas: Analytics, \\nSystems, or Human-Centered Data Science. The remaining elective course can be \\nany course with number 600 or above chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any \\nadditional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered \\nelectives. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTo maintain full-time enrollment status, a student must enroll in a minimum of 36 \\ncourse units per semester. A student may not take more than 60 units per \\nsemester, without permission from their academic advisor. Students must \\nmaintain full-time enrollment status (minimum of 36 units) in their final semester. \\n3.3.4 Prerequisite Core Course \\nAll MCDS students are expected to pass the 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data \\nScience course by the end of their first semester. Each student must pass 11-637 with a \\ngrade of “B” or better.  \\n3.3.5 Plan of study \\nThe degree consists of two timing options based on the length of time the student spends \\nworking on the degree. The student chooses their timing at the start of the degree \\nprogram (for visa requirements). Changes in timing are possible with the approval of the \\nDirector of the degree program and successful visa extension application with CMU’s \\nOffice of International Education. Note that all degree options consist of the same amount \\nof coursework: \\n\", '\\uf0b7 \\nProfessional Preparation Track – a 16-month degree consisting of study for Fall \\nand Spring semesters, a summer internship, and Fall semester of study. Each \\nsemester consists of a minimum of 48 units of study. This timing is typical for most \\nstudents. The student graduates in December. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nResearch Preparation Track – a 20-month degree consisting of study for Fall and \\nSpring semesters, a summer internship, and a second year of Fall and Spring \\nstudy. Each semester consists of a minimum of 36 units of study. This timing is \\ndesigned for students interested in extending their time at CMU for developing \\napplied research skills in preparation for further graduate study or research-\\noriented employment. Note that the per-semester course load is lower, but the \\ntotal cost is higher since four semesters of tuition are paid.

Students are encouraged to choose elective \\ncourses in the curriculum according to their professional goals and mastery of the main \\nsubjects.  \\n3.3.10 Capstone project \\nThe capstone project consists of students working in a team or individually on a project. \\nThe capstone project integrates the educational experience of the student. A capstone \\nproject is typically a CMU research project, or an industry sponsored project; \\noccasionally students define capstone topics through communication with the faculty. \\nStudents interested in defining their own capstone topics should discuss with the MCDS \\nfaculty as early as possible. The capstone project is a great opportunity for a student (or \\nstudent team) to “show off” their unique skills and accomplishments. Capstone projects \\nhave been instrumental in the hiring decisions for several employers. \\n3.3.11 Elective courses \\nElectives can be any graduate level course (numbered 600 or above) in the School of \\nComputer Science. Students use their elective courses to enhance study in an area of \\ninterest or to explore new areas of interest. \\n3.3.12 Undergraduate courses \\nUndergraduate courses are taken to address an area of weakness in the student’s prior \\npreparation. Undergraduate courses (numbered less than or equal to 599) may be taken \\npass/fail or for credit but do not count toward the 144 units of eligible study: The course \\nand course grade will appear on the student’s transcript, and the course grade will factor \\nas part of the student’s QPA. \\n', '18\\n3.3.13 Independent study course \\nIndependent study courses allow students to cover study of a particular area of interest, \\nand are used when no formal course is available in a given subject area. Students who are \\ninterested in continuing to a Ph.D. degree often enroll in Independent Study, since it \\noffers the opportunity to perform research directly with a faculty member. Independent \\nstudy courses are considered electives. \\nEach independent study course must be advised and approved by at least one faculty \\nmember. Agreement to supervise an independent study course is purely voluntary on the \\npart of the faculty member. It is the duty of the student, therefore, to negotiate the terms \\nand conditions of the independent study with the pertinent faculty members of CMU who \\nwill be supervising the study. These individuals are referred to as “independent study \\nsupervisors.” Once the student finds someone who agrees to supervise such a course, \\nhe/she must: \\n1. Students wishing to take an independent study must request approval from their \\nacademic advisor and complete proposal before the first day of classes in a given \\nsemester: \\n2. Enter into an agreement with the independent study supervisor that includes \\ncourse expectations, including deliverables. \\n3. Secure the “Independent Study Contract Form” from the MCDS administrator. \\n4. Complete the form, provide a brief description of the work to be done, including \\ndeliverables and how they will be graded. \\n5. Secure signatures of both the student and the supervisor. Return the form to the \\nMCDS administrator in order to obtain approval for the independent study from the \\nDirector. \\nIndependent study contracts must be submitted no later than on the last day of the first \\nweek of classes in a given semester. \\n3.3.14 Double counting courses \\nNo course may be used to complete two MCDS degree requirements, nor may a course \\nsatisfy requirements in two degree programs. \\n3.3.15 Courses outside of the School of Computer Science \\nElective courses in other Schools at Carnegie Mellon may be taken with prior permission \\nof the Director. \\n3.3.16 Grades \\nAll courses offered by the SCS CMU are graded on the 4.3 grading standard  \\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Grades.html. MCDS students must maintain a \\n3.0 overall average each semester to remain in good standing. A student must obtain a B- \\nor better grade in all courses, which count towards core requirements. If a student \\n', '19\\nreceives a C- or better, that course may count as an elective towards the degree \\nrequirements. All courses must receive a letter grade; courses taken pass/fail do not \\ncount towards the MCDS degree. \\nEnrollment Services is the only University office that can provide an official letter of \\nenrollment, official transcript and enrollment verification. Enrollment verification can \\nbe requested online through The HUB at: https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-\\nrecords/verifications/ \\n3.3.17 Student Review, Academic Probation and Academic Actions \\nThe MCDS program conducts an academic progress review at the conclusion of each \\nsemester in order to monitor individual student progress towards graduation regarding \\nthe fulfillment of curricular requirements, course grades, and academic integrity. Should \\na student’s effort fall below the acceptable level of academic performance and/or fail to \\nmeet standards and policies established by Carnegie Mellon University, the student may \\nbe dismissed from the program. \\nInfractions \\nAfter each academic progress review, each student will receive a letter indicating the \\nresult of the review and their standing in the program. If applicable, the letter will also \\nnote the following infractions by the student in the given semester: \\n\\uf0b7 Cumulative QPA is below 3.0, resulting in the student being put on Academic \\nProbation (see below) \\n\\uf0b7 Cumulative QPA is below 2.6, resulting in academic probation or possible \\ndismissal (see below) \\n\\uf0b7 Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) deemed an infraction by the MCDS committee \\n(see 3.7.2) \\nMinimum QPA and Academic Probation \\nStudents must maintain a cumulative QPA of 3.0 to remain in good standing with the \\nprogram. Should a student’s overall QPA drop below 3.0 during any given semester, \\nhe/she will be placed on academic probation for the following semester. In probation \\ncases, the student will be required to \\n\\uf0b7 \\nenroll in courses as advised by the academic advisor,  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nimprove his/her grades to no less than an overall 3.0 QPA in the following \\nsemester, and  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nmeet any other goal set by the advisor during that period (e.g., fulfilling a core \\ncourse requirement).  \\nIf a student’s cumulative QPA drops below 2.6, the student will be considered at risk of \\nbeing unable to complete the program and will be considered for dismissal. He/she will \\nbe required to meet the program director to discuss his/her situation. Only if, after that \\nmeeting, the MCDS program committee ascertains that the student is likely to complete \\n', '20\\nthe remaining program requirements in the allotted time, the student will be allowed to \\ncontinue his/her studies in MCDS, and dismissed otherwise. If the student is allowed to \\ncontinue their studies, they will be placed on academic probation for the following \\nsemester and is subject to the requirements above. \\nDismissal \\nA student may be dismissed from the program for any of the following cases: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIf the student has been put on academic probation and failed to meet the remedial \\nrequirements set by the advisor in the following semester, or committed an \\nAcademic Integrity Violation deemed an infraction by the MCDS committee while \\non academic probation \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIf the student has a cumulative QPA of 2.6 or lower and the MCDS program \\ncommittee does not ascertain that the student is likely to complete the remaining \\nprogram requirements in the allotted time \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIf the student has committed two Academic Integrity Violation deemed infractions \\nby the MCDS committee (see 3.7.2) \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIf the student has committed an Academic Integrity Violation infraction where the \\nviolation is deemed to be sufficiently egregious as determined by the MCDS \\nprogram committee \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIf the student has been found to infringe a University Policy, where such \\ninfringement is deemed grounds for dismissal \\nStudents who realize that one of these situations may apply to them are strongly \\nencouraged to meet with the academic advisor to discuss a plan to mitigate the situation. \\nStudents who find they are struggling in the program will have the best chances of success \\nif they communicate early and often with the academic advisor. \\n3.3.18 Incomplete grades \\nCarnegie Mellon University students are expected to complete a course during the \\nacademic semester in which the course was taken. However, if the instructor agrees, a \\ngrade of “I” (incomplete) may be given when a student has been unable to complete the \\nwork of a course. However, the work completed up to that date must be of passing quality \\nand the grade of incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other \\nstudents. \\n', 'By awarding an “I” grade, an instructor must specify the requirements for the completion \\nof the work and designate a default letter grade in the event that the student fails to \\ncomplete the remaining work. \\nStudents must complete the required course work by no later than the end of the \\nfollowing academic semester or sooner if required by the instructor. \\n21\\nThe instructor must record the permanent course grade by the last day of the \\nexamination period of the following semester, or the Registrar will automatically assign \\nthe default grade. \\nIf further work has not been completed after one semester and a default grade is \\nrendered, the default grade will become the grade of record. \\n3.3.19 Change of grades and missing grades \\nIf a grade has been assigned in error, it can be changed to a different permanent grade. \\nThe procedure for changing a grade is as follows: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDiscuss the matter with the course instructor; provide evidence that the grade issued \\nwas not the grade earned. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIf the instructor agrees, the student should contact the program administrator to \\nprocess a Change of Grade Form in order to correct the grade that was issued in error. \\nGenerally, the instructor is the final authority for a course grade. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIf a grade has not been assigned, please notify the course instructor for the \\ncompletion of a Missing Grade Form. \\n3.3.20 Qualifying examinations and procedures (or equivalent) \\nNone required. \\n3.3.21 Thesis/dissertation \\nNone required. \\n3.3.22 On transfer to another program \\nIf the requirements for the MCDS degree have not been completed when a student leaves \\nto pursue another academic program, the degree will not be awarded. Completion of the \\nMCDS degree does not guarantee admission into any doctoral degree program at \\nCarnegie Mellon University. The courses that will be completed as part of the MCDS may \\nserve to enhance one’s application to these programs but will in no way insure \\nadmittance. \\n3.3.23 Intellectual property policy \\nThe MCDS degree program adheres to Carnegie Mellon University policy on intellectual \\nproperty: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html \\n3.3.24 Teaching requirements \\nNone required. However, students are encouraged to apply for teaching assistant \\npositions in courses where they have excelled. \\n3.3.25 Language proficiency requirements \\nNone required. However, non-native English speakers are encouraged to take advantage \\nof the various support functions provided by the Intercultural Communication Center \\n(ICC) and the Global Communication Center (GCC). \\n', '22\\n3.3.26 Academic Integrity and Policies on Plagiarism and Cheating \\nThe university considers any form of cheating or plagiarism to be a serious violation of \\nstudent ethics. The student is required to understand and rigorously follow only the \\npermitted forms of collaboration as defined by the instructor in every class. The work \\nyou submit must be your own, unless you have clearly attributed it to others. You must \\nnot use the work of others without proper citation. And, you must not use resources, \\nincluding other persons, except as authorized by the course or project for which you are \\nsubmitting the work. Such conduct might be accepted or commonplace elsewhere, but it \\nis not here. Be careful. Be warned. Failure to abide by these rules, even just once, can \\nresult in your permanent separation from the University without refund of money paid. \\nNote that the policy requires the student to be informed and understand the academic \\nintegrity rules for every assignment or exam in a course. \\nThe MCDS program strives to produce graduates with the highest standards of academic \\nintegrity. Academic Integrity Violations are taken very seriously and the MCDS program \\nhas a zero tolerance policy for multiple Academic Integrity Violations. A single violation \\nis grounds for dismissal from the graduate program if deemed sufficiently egregious as \\ndetermined by the MCDS program committee. If a student commits a second violation, \\nthe expected penalty is dismissal from the graduate program (see also academic progress \\nreview at section 3.3.17). \\nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity: \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html  \\nThe policy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and \\nprovides definitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. \\nA review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html  is also \\nrecommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and \\nadjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures \\nalso outline the appeal process. \\n', '3.3.27 Process for Appealing Final Grades  \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of-grades-and-academic-actions.html  \\nFinal grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the \\napproval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of \\nsound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent \\nof the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual \\nexceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is \\nbased on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade \\nor failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who \\nassigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy. \\n23\\n3.3.27 Teaching Assistants \\nThe MCDS degree does not have a teaching requirement. However, some students may \\nwish to be a teaching assistant. MCDS students may petition for approval to TA up to one \\ncourse per semester provided that they are in good academic standing (Overall QPA 3.0 \\nor above). \\nAs required by the English Fluency in Higher Education Act of 1990, graduate students \\nare required to have a certain level of fluency in English before they can instruct in \\nPennsylvania. Through this Act, all institutions of higher education in the state are \\nrequired to evaluate and certify the English fluency of all instructional personnel, \\nincluding teaching assistants and interns. \\nThe full university policy can be reviewed at: \\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-\\ninstructors.html. \\nIn addition to administering the International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Test (mandatory \\nscreening test for any non-native speaker of English), Language Support in the Student \\nAcademic Success Center helps teaching assistants who are non-native English speakers \\ndevelop fluency and cultural understanding to teach successfully at Carnegie Mellon. \\nVisit the website for additional information: https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/ \\n3.3.28 Internship Requirement and Search for Full Time Employment \\nAn internship is required for the degree program. In some cases, when a student has \\nprior work experience, the Director of the degree program may waive this requirement. \\nStudents start searching for internships generally in the Fall and Spring semesters. Once \\nthe student returns from an internship in the Fall, they should immediately begin the \\nsearch \\nfor \\nfull \\ntime \\nemployment. \\nExtensive \\nresources \\nare \\navailable \\nat \\nhttp://www.cmu.edu/career/ including a resume submission system, a list of employers, \\non campus interviews and mock interviews, and many other resources. \\n', 'The \\nTechnical \\nOpportunities \\nConference \\n(TOC) \\nhttp://engineering.cmu.edu/companies/toc/ occurs every September. This conference is \\none of the main recruiting events each year. \\nAll international students are required to apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT). \\nCPT is employment that is an integral part of an established curriculum and is directly \\nrelated to the student’s major area of study.

It also defines the undergraduate and graduate \\ngrading standards. \\nYou can review the university grading policies here: \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/grading.html  \\n3.6.2 University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses \\nCarnegie Mellon University offers students the opportunity to take courses for credit \\nthrough a cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education \\n(PCHE) and Cross-registration below) and through the receipt of transfer credit from \\nother accredited institutions. The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will include \\ninformation on such courses as follows: Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken \\nthrough the university’s cross-registration program will have grades recorded on the \\ntranscript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will be recorded on this \\ntranscript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such courses will \\nnot be taken into account for academic actions, honors or QPA calculations. (Note: \\nsuspended students may take courses elsewhere; however, they may receive transfer \\ncredit only if their college’s and department’s policies allow this.) \\n', 'You can review the university policy here: \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-\\nassignment.html  \\n3.6 Academic Integrity \\n3.7.1 Expectations Regarding Proper Conduct \\nIn the midst of self-exploration, the high demands of a challenging academic \\nenvironment can create situations where some students have difficulty exercising good \\njudgment. Academic challenges can provide many opportunities for high standards to \\nevolve if students actively reflect on these challenges and if the community supports \\n25\\ndiscussions to aid in this process. It is the responsibility of the entire community to \\nestablish and maintain the integrity of our university.  \\nCarnegie Mellon University educates its students to become professionals who will serve \\nsociety with integrity. The university also creates and disseminates new knowledge and \\nexpressions of knowledge in ways that benefit society. Carnegie Mellon strives to serve \\nthe changing needs of society through the three primary goals outlined in its mission \\nstatement: to create and disseminate knowledge and art through research and artistic \\nexpression, teaching and learning and transfer to society, to serve students by teaching \\nthem leadership and problem-solving skills, and the values of quality, ethical behavior, \\nresponsibility to society and commitments to work, to pursue the advantages provided by \\na diverse community, open to the exchange of ideas, where discovery and artistic \\ncreativity can flourish. \\nIn any presentation, creative, artistic or research, it is the ethical responsibility of each \\nstudent to identify the conceptual sources of the work submitted. Failure to do so is \\ndishonest and is the basis for a charge of cheating or plagiarism, which is subject to \\ndisciplinary action.  \\nPlease review the University Policy on Academic Integrity \\n(https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html). The \\npolicy includes the University expectations around academic integrity and provides \\ndefinitions of cheating, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance. \\n', \"A review of the University’s Academic Disciplinary Actions procedures \\n(https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-discipline/index.html) is also \\nrecommended. These procedures outline the process for investigating, reporting, and \\nadjudicating violations of the University Policy on Academic Integrity. The procedures \\nalso outline the appeal process. \\n3.7.2 Protocol for Academic Integrity Violations \\nThe university has a very clear and specific protocol for responding to alleged violations \\nof academic integrity. Carnegie Mellon's Academic Disciplinary Actions Overview for \\nGraduate Students describes procedures and the appeal process for disciplinary actions \\nagainst graduate students in cases of alleged academic integrity violation. \\nFor more information on disciplinary actions please see: \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-\\naffairs/theword/acad_standards/creative/disciplinary.html \\nFurther documentation on how to respond to an allegation of a violation as a graduate \\nstudent: \\n26\\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocsi/academic-integrity/grads.html  \\nImportant Note: MCDS implements the above policy’s option of “conven[ing] a \\ndisciplinary hearing according to the procedures of the department/program”. We have \\nadopted the following hearing procedure and “two strikes” rule: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nIf an instructor determines that an academic integrity violation has occurred, \\nboth the instructor and students are given the opportunity to explain the situation \\nto the MCDS program committee. A written hearing by email suffices for this \\npurpose. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nThe program committee then reviews all information and decides whether the \\nviolation is deemed an infraction (see 3.3.17), and which secondary actions are to \\nbe taken on the program level. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nTwo-Strike-Rule: MCDS may dismiss students upon a first AIV infraction. A \\nsecond infraction will always lead to the offending student being dismissed from \\nthe program, with no exceptions. \\nThe MCDS program reserves the right to withdraw a degree even though it has been \\ngranted should there be discovery that the work upon which it was based or the academic \\nrecords in support of it had been falsified. In such a case, the degree will be withdrawn \\npromptly upon discovery of the falsification. The complete reference to this university \\npolicy \\nis \\navailable \\nat: \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-\\nlife/withdrawal-of-a-degree.html \\n4 Academic Policies \\n4.1 MCDS Academic Policies \\n4.1.1 Duration of Study \\nMCDS students enrolled for full-time studies are normally expected to complete the \\ndegree in three semesters (16 months). This includes a summer internship. \\n4.1.2 Double-Dipping \\nA Masters student who uses courses taken as part of another degree program (at \\nCarnegie Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requirements cannot use those \\nsame courses toward any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science \\nwithout prior approval. \\n4.1.3 Pass/Fail and Audit Grades \\nPass/fail and audit grades are not permitted for courses used to satisfy a degree \\nrequirement. Graduate students who are required to take additional undergraduate \\ncourses to build up the core foundations of computer science may not elect the pass/fail \\nor audit option for these courses. \\n\", '27\\n4.1.4 Transfer Credit \\nAn equivalent graduate course previously completed at Carnegie Mellon, or another \\ninstitution, may be permitted to satisfy one of the MCDS course requirements, with \\npermission from the Director. Students must petition for transfer credit by providing \\nthe Program Director with the prior course syllabus and other details that may be \\nrequired by the Director in order to make a decision. See the section on “Definition of \\ntransfer credit versus course exemption”. NOTE: In all cases, credit may only be \\ntransferred from another degree program for courses deemed “free electives” - i.e., \\ncourses which were not used to satisfy a core requirement or total units requirement in \\na prior degree program. \\nAll MS students are required to take a minimum of 96 units of coursework at CMU. \\n4.1.5 External Internships and Job Interviewing \\nMCDS students are expected to attain an external internship during the summer. \\nInternational students must coordinate carefully with the University, due to visa \\nrestrictions. International students are required to consult with the Office of \\nInternational Education for eligibility before seeking an internship/co-op or signing an \\noffer contract. \\nWe caution all students to be aware of potential intellectual property (IP) implications \\nwith internships, and to review any IP agreements with their academic advisor before \\nsigning them. It is possible to lose ownership of your own inventions if they occur during \\nan external internship. \\nWhile it is necessary for students to travel off-campus for job interviews, it is not \\nacceptable for a student to miss a course requirement or a capstone project commitment \\ndue to interview travel. Students should work proactively with prospective employers to \\narrange interview travel in a way that minimizes the impact on their final semester \\ncourse work. \\n4.1.6 Transferring into the MCDS Program \\nDirect transfers into the MCDS program are not permitted. Students who are currently \\nenrolled at Carnegie Mellon who wish to transfer into the MCDS program must do so by \\napplying to the MCDS program via the normal admissions process. As specified in Sec. \\n4.1.4 in this document, some transfer credit and/or exemption from MCDS requirements \\nmay be possible on a case-by-case basis. \\n4.1.7 Transferring Out of the MCDS Program \\nThe MCDS program does not prevent students from transferring to another degree \\nprogram. Each degree program has its own rules about whether and when transfers into \\nthe program are permitted. A student that is interested in transferring out of the MCDS \\ndegree program should consult the handbook and Program Director of the desired \\n', \"28\\ndegree program to learn whether transfers are permitted, and if so, how and when to \\nrequest such a transfer. \\n4.1.8 Statute of Limitations \\nhttps://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of- \\nlimitations.html  \\nAs outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations (link above), students will \\ncomplete all requirements for the master’s degree within a maximum of seven years \\nfrom original matriculation as a master’s student, or less if required by a more restrictive \\ndepartment, school or college policy. Once this time-to-degree limit has lapsed, the \\nperson may resume work towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted to a currently \\noffered master’s degree program under criteria determined by that program. \\nUnder extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, \\nfamily or parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the \\nrelevant department's recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or \\ndesignate), defer the lapse for a period commensurate with the duration of that \\ninterruption. Students who are pursuing a master’s degree as part-time students for all \\nsemesters of their program, as approved by their program, may also appeal to their \\nprogram or department for extension of the time to degree limit. \\n4.2 LTI Academic Policies \\n4.2.1 “Grandfather” policy \\nA student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered \\nthe program; or, at the student's choice, the student can graduate under policies that are \\nadopted after the student entered the program. In unusual cases, the Director may \\napprove exceptions to the program requirements. \\n4.2.2 Course Drop/Add/withdrawal procedures \\nStudents taking undergraduate and Master’s level courses must follow the procedures and \\ndeadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the \\nacademic calendar. Information can be found at: \\n https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes/index.html. \\n\", \"There is a separate calendar for masters level courses.  \\n4.2.3 Courses with restricted enrollment \\nMCDS students have priority for the program core courses. The MCDS program \\nadministrators cannot intercede with other departments to secure seats for its students \\nin other courses as all departments reserve seats for their accepted students. Usually all \\nremaining open seats are assigned on a first- come, first-served basis.  \\nStudents can, \\n29\\non occasion, contact the assigned course instructor in order to plead his/her case for \\nadmission to the course. Admission may be granted at the discretion of the instructor. \\nThe policy of the department offering the course(s) is always followed. \\n4.2.4 Definition of transfer credit versus course exemption \\nThe LTI may grant transfer credit or issue an exemption for equivalent graduate courses \\npreviously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the Director of the \\nparticular program. If a student is exempt from a required course due to prior courses or \\nexperience, the student can replace that course with an open elective.
