Notes:
* Students taking courses in Heinz College and Tepper School of Business (MBA and Computational Finance programs) must review and follow separate academic calendars;
Similarly, students taking doctoral courses must review and follow the doctoral calendar for those courses.
** Summer Semester includes semester-length courses, as well as mini-5 and mini-6. Courses previously offered as Summer Session One (6-weeks) correspond & follow the Mini-5 dates and deadlines. Summer Semester Two courses (6-weeks) correspond & follow their separate dates.
*** Summer Semester final exams will be scheduled by the University Registrar's Office.
Please see www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-changes for more information about Course Changes: Add, Drop, Withdrawal & Voucher Election.
1 Students dropping a course while remaining enrolled (in at least one course-section) will receive a tuition adjustment only if they drop by this date. Students taking a Leave of Absence or Withdrawing from the university should consult the official Tuition Adjustment Policy.
2 Graduate students in CFA, DC and SCS do not receive W grades for course withdrawal. Only graduate students in CIT, HC, MCS and TSB receive W grades.
3 After this date, course withdrawal is permitted in doctoral course-sections only. Students may not withdraw from undergraduate or master’s course-sections after this date.
4 Undergraduate and master’s students may use vouchers to drop, withdraw, or make a pass/no pass election after the posted deadlines. Doctoral students do not receive vouchers. Advisor approval is required for vouchers to be initiated, and it is strongly recommended that students contact their advisors before 12 noon on the voucher election deadline date to discuss options.
