The Language Technologies Concentration requires that SCS students complete one core course and their choice of three elective courses of at least 9 units each. The electives can be chosen from a specific set of stand-alone courses. In addition to the four courses, students are required to do an undergraduate research project for at least 9 units to complete their concentration.

Core course: Human Language for Artificial Intelligence (11-411)
Electives- choose three: Natural Language Processing (11-411), Machine Learning for Text and Graph-based Mining (11-441), Search Engines (11-442), Speech Processing (11-492), Machine Learning in Practice (11-344), Advanced Natural Language Processing (11-711), Machine Translation and Sequence-to-Sequence Models (11-731), Multilingual Natural Language Processing (11-737), Neural Networks for NLP (11-747), Speech Recognition and Understanding (11-751), Language and Statistics (11-761), Multimodal Affective Computing (11-776), The Nature of Language (80-180)
Project: Students can complete a semester-long directed research project in the context of being registered for an independent study or thesis.  This should provide hands-on experience and an in-depth study of a topic in same area as a chosen elective.
